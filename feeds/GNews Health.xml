When babies are between 15 and 18 months old, they get a fourth shot, and the fifth somewhere between four and six years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough causes bouts of coughing so extreme that they can lead to vomiting and broken ribs. Roughly a third of babies who are infected need to be treated in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This year so far, five children, four of whom were babies under one, have died, while 10 died all of last year. Children that age have typically received three doses, which, altogether, are about 85 percent effective at preventing disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors nationwide are reporting a flurry of new patients being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of pertussis, which, along with a violent cough, can also cause &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-dcbfbd30-7149-11f0-9148-b7a3ccd1598d"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, and brain damage from lack of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whooping cough triggers such severe coughing fits followed by a 'whooping' sound in the chest that patients may vomit or even fracture ribs. Nearly one in three infected babies requires hospitalization (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, Kentucky officials announced that two babies had died over the previous six months, the first deaths in the state since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neither the babies nor their mothers were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in North Carolina, the state reported the first case of the year in June 2025. By the first week of August, there were 13 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My hospital, we had no cases in 2023, 13 in 2024, and already this year, and we’re only halfway through the year, we’ve had 27,’ Dr David Weber, Director of the UNC Medical Center’s infection prevention department, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/new-back-to-school-warning-as-whooping-cough-cases-rise-244275781508"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In neighboring South Carolina, 183 cases have been reported compared to 147 this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We’re certainly seeing our vaccine rates decrease, especially post-Covid,' &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/south-carolina-whooping-cough-cases-rise/65557186"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;Dr Martha Buchanan, a family medicine physician with the South Carolina Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately, I think it’s going to take us some time to recover from that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in Utah, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah-monthly-communicable-disease-report.html"&gt;at least 182 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported so far this year, compared to the five-year average to this point in the year of about 77 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;During the 2024-2025 school year, 3.6 percent of kindergarteners were exempted from one or more shots, up from 3.3 percent the year before. Most of the exemptions were among people with certain religious or philosophical views that disagree with vaccination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Washington County, Utah alone, health officials have &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/southern-utah/whooping-cough-mysteriously-packing-a-wallop-in-southern-utah-in-big-numbers"&gt;reported 28 cases&lt;/a&gt;, where the yearly average typically hovers around 10 to 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve seen admissions, an increased amount of kids that are needing to be hospitalized for it,’ Dr Kerri Smith, a pediatrician at St. George Regional Medical Center, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/southern-utah/whooping-cough-mysteriously-packing-a-wallop-in-southern-utah-in-big-numbers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tim Larsen, a pediatrician at the same medical center who has seen several patients in his outpatient clinic, added: ‘You get to that two-week, three-week mark, and it’s getting worse, not better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s at least a way to make the illness more mild when you do get it, and get it treated early. If you suspect whooping cough, bring them into the clinic.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommend a booster shot every 10 years for everyone living in or around outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The past two years’ month-per-month case counts have coincided with steadily declining rates of vaccination among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slightly over &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;92 percent of kindergarteners&lt;/a&gt; entering the 2024-2025 school year had received the DTaP vaccine, lower than the herd immunity threshold of about 94 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reaching this threshold requires the vast majority of the population to be vaccinated, resulting in drastically lower odds of the pathogen be able to spread from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the 2024-2025 school year, 3.6 percent of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14411083/Outbreak-highly-contagious-childhood-disease-expands.html"&gt;kindergarteners were exempted&lt;/a&gt; from one or more shots, up from 3.3 percent the year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of whooping cough often look like a common cold. But they worsen to include rib-cracking coughs and wheezing between coughing, as well as vomiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exemptions in the 2024-2025 school year increased in 36 states and Washington DC, with 17 states reporting exemptions exceeding five percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of exemptions were for non-medical reasons, including for religious reasons and parents' personal beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 0.2 percent of exemptions were granted for medical reasons, such as as severe allergy, being immunocompromised, or having chronic autoimmune conditions. But a far higher 3.4 percent were granted for religious or philosophical reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one percent of babies who become sick with whooping cough die from it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria Bordetella pertussis is often spread from parents, who may only exhibit cold-like symptoms, to their babies and young children, who are far less equipped to combat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women are encouraged to get a single dose of TDaP vaccine between the 27 and 36 week marks to boost the level of pertussis antibodies in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This will protect their newborn babies if they are exposed to the disease before being vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough is treated with a regimen of antibiotics, which is crucial for killing the bacteria that cause the illness, reducing the severity of the disease and the risk of coming down with pneumonia, and shortening the duration of symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 20:24:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxObjdlSkVjMmpDUEdZWE5pUE5XZHZhaElvZGpuME93NDRfNnJpa2VheUNpOU9qbjZXMDEwc2VjNTJkQlZSUXc5SGIzZmpPd1FFQUFyVVBVTFNwejk2U2dpNHFIb1dhYVVyZm5oV2QzaWx3MS1ET21pRDFrMXdmTk0tT3VNbHlVZ2lLQ0hLOUNtbkVWME4wOERVSWhIZmlJODhsT01WV1RjclBWeTdiclM1Yg</guid></item><item><title>牙线可以提供下一代疫苗，无需针头- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPU3p6VzRCU1A3Z1hCcHhoak9rZklrQ3BDdGw0cXRjT0o2SjVud1VabGNic3N3bGdwdl9zbkRwTXQxNW42QmVDd3pNMm5kZG5xZ1FyTllDS09KTnZ1U0tMWmNWWlJsbHNkSlVPdXFiWlpUVGsxZHVMdnJrZ2R6SzcySlJvNGc3a2cyS3pRSUozVWg1bzN5dWZsRWNGWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Flu shot season is around the corner, and while injections remain the most common form of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-vaccine-for-yeast-infections-could-soon-be-reality-2000617388"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, scientists are working hard to find other ways to deliver inoculations that don’t involve shoving a needle into your flesh. And in a new study, researchers think they might have found another novel approach: dental floss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the new work, a team of scientists based in the U.S. demonstrated how this might work on lab mice, finding that vaccine delivery via dental floss was more effective at stimulating antibody production than if the vaccine was delivered under the mice’s tongues and about as effective as a nasal spray delivery method. If the results hold true for humans, then some vaccines could be given via tooth tape and without the need for needles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here we show that flat tape dental floss can deliver vaccines through the junctional epithelium of the gingival sulcus, exploiting its naturally leaky properties,” the researchers wrote in the study, which was published in July in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. The junctional epithelium is the technical term for the deep tissue between the tooth and the gum. Epithelial tissues are one of three layers of so-called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23930-mucosa"&gt;mucosal&lt;/a&gt; surfaces, which are the membranes that lubricate and protect your body’s organs and cavities, including your nose, mouth, and intestines. Many pathogens like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-super-vaccine-for-flu-and-covid-works-now-politics-could-sink-it-2000599293"&gt;influenza and Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; can enter the body through these mucosal surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“If a vaccine is given by injection, antibodies are primarily produced in the bloodstream throughout the body, and relatively few antibodies are produced on mucosal surfaces,” Harvinder Singh Gill, co-author of the study and a professor in Nanomedicine at North Carolina State University, explained in a &lt;a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2025/07/vaccines-via-dental-floss/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But we know that when a vaccine is given via the mucosal surface, antibodies are stimulated not only in the bloodstream, but also on mucosal surfaces.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This improves the body’s ability to prevent infection, because there is an additional line of antibody defense before a pathogen enters the body,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because the tissue in between our teeth and gums is more permeable than other similar tissues, like those lining your stomach, lungs, and intestines, then it should be able to introduce &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-shingles-vaccine-could-be-a-secret-weapon-against-heart-attacks-2000598150"&gt;a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; into the body relatively easily, triggering the production of antibodies throughout the mucosal layers. To test this idea, the researchers applied peptide flu vaccine on unwaxed dental floss, and then used it to floss the teeth of lab mice.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Gill and colleagues then compared the animals’ antibody production to that of mice that either received the peptide flu vaccine via a nasal spray or under their tongues. The dental floss vaccine delivered significantly superior antibody production on mucosal surfaces than the under-the-tongue inoculation, and was comparable to the nasal spray.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is extremely promising, because most vaccine formulations cannot be given via the nasal epithelium—the barrier features in that mucosal surface prevent efficient uptake of the vaccine,” said Gill, adding that nasal delivery also carries the risk of the vaccine reaching the brain, which could pose safety concerns. “Vaccination via the junctional epithelium offers no such risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team also tested the floss approach with three other vaccine classes—proteins, inactivated viruses, and mRNA—and revealed that the novel method triggered antibodies both in the bloodstream and mucosal surfaces in all of them. What’s more, their efficacy wasn’t impeded if the mice consumed food or water right after flossing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To investigate the practicality of the flossing approach, the researchers also tested its mechanics with humans. Using floss picks, they coated the tape with food dye and asked study participants to try and get it as deep between their teeth and their gums as they could. Participants were able to deposit around 60% of the dye in the gum pocket, indicating that vaccine-coated floss picks could be an effective way to deliver vaccines to that tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As for costs, the researchers think that it would be similar in price to other vaccine delivery techniques. However, there are some inherent limitations to a floss vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For example, it can only be used for individuals with teeth,” the researchers explained in the study. “Therefore, this approach cannot be used in neonates [newborns] until they experience teeth eruption, which typically occurs at around 6 months of age. Further, the impact of gingival tissue infection on vaccination is unclear. Additional studies are required to answer this question.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

(Drugs &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-treatment-uncomplicated-urinary-tract-infections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pivya;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Pivya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-new-treatment-uncomplicated-urinary-tract-infections-adult-women-who-have-limited-or-no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Orlynvah;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Orlynvah&lt;/a&gt; were approved in 2024 to treat UTIs, but they fall into existing antibiotic classes.) “Gepotidacin is part of a new class of antibiotics called triazaacenaphthylenes,” DeTata says. “This class is so new that currently, gepotidacin is the only one in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Antibiotics fight bacteria in two main ways: They can kill bacteria (bactericidal) or they can prevent them from multiplying (bacteriostatic), says DeTata. For example, some antibiotics interfere with the formation of bacteria cell walls, causing the wall to burst and killing the bacteria, while others disrupt the synthesis of proteins, which bacteria need to survive. “Gepotidacin works in an entirely new way by acting on enzymes called topoisomerases, leading to breaks in the DNA strands of bacteria,” DeTata says. “So gepotidacin is bactericidal, as these breaks in the DNA strands kill the bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The drug’s main side effects in clinical trials were diarrhea (16% of participants) and nausea (9%), both which are common side effects for antibiotics in general. The research also found that gepotidacin performs just as well as (if not better than) nitrofurantoin, which is a frontline treatment for UTIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Added bonus: Gepotidacin “has the potential to be used for the treatment of gonorrhea, which has also been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/super-gonorrheais-rare-but-the-sti-is-smart--and-doctors-are-concerned-213856598.html" data-ylk="slk:difficult to treat due to multi-antibiotic resistance;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;difficult to treat due to multi-antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;,” says DeTata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Weiss and many other doctors, having a new treatment option for UTIs is something to celebrate. “I’m very excited that a new medication has come to market,” he says. “Any new medication for something so common is a win-win situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="ct:story;elm:img;itc:0;" class="stretched-box" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/article/how-innovations-in-womens-health-are-making-it-a-priority--not-an-afterthought-210038571.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 18:45:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6AFBVV95cUxNMXkwYm5MMEhhM2IxYUpRYVMwNTlsb2llSnZUbnFKejVkS1FGVUJSbnVHaGVnckZzLWE2OEFYaFNIZmF0WHNCSTNaNVYxNjhPbk5XVDlrUnBUUm96NEE4VzUxY1NGazdlekptbVBGbTYtblJFQnNvX1BlZGpEMVp0aDE2T1lfWUFMQXExbkVGdnRHUXRqV1lXb3VuV0FvLTZONWxCNDRZNy1FZ3RYclVPczF5UmlsRmU4Wmc2dmtSVEdOSV9iX0NnRWJxZFRXMGg2bGk3XzZzSW9aT1NMNDhabnMwaVpSaU9L</guid></item><item><title>列|风扇实际上并没有让您冷静下来。请尝试此操作。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1NbmNVb1VkTHM4YVctVXBtMFotbkF5R0dCWGR4OEtWTW5qaHBwdUY0bGFjYnFUVk0zRWpYWVp2eGF0dDd4MWNjdlVEOW5VendDazJKZUNvTkozcm5KeVBVVmR2UU1RRTNLbDAtc0MwSE9GNUpfTEtjdlZ4WTE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FJJYQ5VWZNETNBG7WXPI2C22ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In hot weather like the kind we’ve seen this summer, fans are everywhere: They’re inexpensive tools that help us feel better in the heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24WVEL76FNGW5KN2IZVVXSYUPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The key word here is “feel.” In temperatures of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38580427/" target="_blank"&gt;around 90 degrees&lt;/a&gt; and higher, which much of the country has been &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/07/23/heat-humidity-cities-forecast/" target="_blank"&gt;experiencing this summer&lt;/a&gt;, fans &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fextreme-heat%2Fabout%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;do very little&lt;/a&gt; to help us beyond tricking our brains into believing we’re not entering heat exhaustion. In extreme heat, fans may paradoxically &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132325007413" target="_blank"&gt;make you&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;hotter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQVPNWV7T5HXZILHF2PRTTHQRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There is no benefit to a fan.

The reason scientists think this happens is that electric fans increase air velocity and make our bodies gain dry heat. This also aggravates &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dehydration-can-creep-up-on-you-and-cause-serious-health-problems/2017/08/11/5ec2c10c-30e3-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;. Younger adults normally compensate by sweating more — after all, sweat is our bodies’ main way of cooling down — but we &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4155032/" target="_blank"&gt;lose our ability&lt;/a&gt; to sweat as robustly when we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3VJ2CMAPN5F43EW52VQQZ57SJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/risk-factors/heat-and-low-income.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; being in air conditioning at least a few hours a day during a heat wave, but that may not work in every situation (&lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=52558" target="_blank"&gt;as many as 12 percent&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. households don’t use air conditioning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GBZSJWKYSFDIPJ76VAIW6TBW2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So to make your fan more effective, try this: Wet your skin first. Use a spray bottle or a sponge to intermittently apply cool tap water to the body — or better yet, if you can, drench your whole shirt. Studies &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01209-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that the combination of electric fans and skin-wetting — but not electric fans alone — can reduce heat strain in temperatures as high as 116 degrees. Wetting the skin works because when that water evaporates off our skin, it wicks heat away with it. That’s the entire reason sweating cools us off — but by wetting your skin from another source, you get all the benefits of evaporation while also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7015226/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing dehydration&lt;/a&gt; by about 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IRSZWMMPVZC4DEO3NBIOMZFWHU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IRSZWMMPVZC4DEO3NBIOMZFWHU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Not a fan of fans&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VY72P6HRRCIPH54JB7QCJAR7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last year, Kenny and his team published &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11581471/" target="_blank"&gt;a study in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; studying the effects of electric fans among older adults. Participants aged 65 to 85 sat for eight hours in 96.8 degree heat and were allowed to drink as much water as they wanted, but some were randomized to an electric fan, while others weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YR2LTJWRAFCRJDT74GFDCNEHHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You would think the fan-users would be cooler, but in reality, all groups reached the same level of hyperthermia and strain on the heart. The only difference, Kenny said, was that the fan-users “felt better” and looked happy as they approached heat exhaustion, while the group who weren’t using fans were acutely aware of their misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RDNIO7RMEZG6RGX4THOR3Y32LY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The mind trick occurs because fans soothe many of the body’s thermal sensors on the surface of our skin. These send a signal telling the brain that the entire body must be comfortable and that we don’t need to sweat so aggressively. But because fans don’t really cool your core, this can create a dangerous and false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4J4T5NQJ45EDVGCXX3UY6DT4M4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For one thing, it could lead people to change their behavior, Kenny said. They might go out and buy groceries, take a walk outside or do other activities that push them over the brink of heat exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6FZRDZILVGAZEGJ7J75ERUUHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Feeling good from fans has nothing to do with the actual change in the body’s physiology. It’s just that those sensors that we have in the body are playing games with you,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="4RZDNFQII5DFJCEMRUTJKFTJ54" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="4RZDNFQII5DFJCEMRUTJKFTJ54" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;More science-backed ways to stay cool&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WXTGMLYRRAG3LJXAR3W3H6HNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It bears reemphasizing the importance of air conditioning during a heat wave (though there is a significant &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/07/air-conditioners-humid-climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;environmental cost&lt;/a&gt;). Even if you don’t have air conditioning at home, a visit to a shopping mall, public library or other air-conditioned environments is associated with a 67 percent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17698676/" target="_blank"&gt;reduced risk&lt;/a&gt; of heat wave-related death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3QZZ2N5E4BFFFDGHEBL2ZA7DQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are a few other science-backed tips that work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ol class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="ISY3HGKLUFE3PFCDXKSWV5EETA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use shading and natural ventilation to prevent heat from building up in your home.&lt;/b&gt; Close window shades during a sunny day and crack open a window to let out hot air; both can help keep indoor temperatures from cooking. When you get in your car on a hot day, open the windows to ventilate for a minute or two first; this helps the air conditioning work its magic more quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrate. Even hot coffee on a hot day is perfectly fine&lt;/b&gt;. “It doesn’t really matter what temperature of water you drink while you’re sweating, because your body compensates for the ingested thermal load or sink enough to maintain core temperature,” said Nathan Morris, an assistant professor in human physiology and nutrition at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. He encourages people to drink whatever water temperature they find palatable to encourage greater fluid intake. If it’s humid outside or you’re exercising to the point that you’re dripping with sweat (meaning, it’s no longer evaporating efficiently), it makes the most sense to stick to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/25/drink-water-cold-temperature/" target="_blank"&gt;cooler drinks&lt;/a&gt;. But if the situation that describes you best this summer is taking an afternoon break at your local cafe in a cute breezy dress, then don’t be embarrassed: Order that hot espresso.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wear loose, breathable clothing like linen.&lt;/b&gt; Tighter and less breathable fabrics keep your sweat from evaporating easily — and remember, it’s the evaporation process that draws heat away from your body, not the sweat itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Try wrapping ice in a damp towel and placing it on your neck&lt;/b&gt;. Applying an ice towel to the neck helps you lose heat via conduction and has been shown to reduce heat strain in certain conditions — namely, doing it in short bursts (for one to two minutes) and then repeating about every 10 minutes. Some of the strongest data supporting this comes from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28647283/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; done during the Australian Open showing that among tennis players, the fan plus skin-wetting combination as well as the ice-towel method both effectively cooled body temperature by a full degree while reducing heart strain. There is a caveat, though: Kenny advises caution for older adults. In adults over age 65, this method may not actually &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10739084/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce strain&lt;/a&gt; on their hearts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-video" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div data-qa="article-video" data-testid="article-video" class="ma-auto"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="wpds-c-gPjxah mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns hide-for-print flex flex-column items-center ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mb-md"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="orca-wrapper" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-ikRUBWG-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="mt-xs mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns left font--subhead font-xxxs gray-dark square-vertical-video" data-qa="video-caption"&gt;Ask A Doctor columnist Trisha Pasricha describes how she packs fiber into her daily diet, from overnight oats in the morning to kiwis at night.

At least eight cups a day is a rule of thumb that many people have heard, which probably stems from a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7692653/" target="_blank"&gt;misinterpretation&lt;/a&gt; of a 1945 recommendation from the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council. A &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/12/06/eight-cups-daily-water-intake/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Science in 2022 found that eight cups per day was unnecessary for most adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LLGR25BOQZFTHFKVIT3WLCF2VQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s reasonable to aim for around that much, but the most common-sense advice is to drink when you’re thirsty, prioritize water over sugary beverages, and, of course, pay extra attention to your increased needs in hot weather. If you’re doing intense exercise or reaching the point of dehydration, electrolyte-containing drinks can be helpful, but if you feel dizzy or light-headed, seek prompt medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-raw_html" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-cbTFcs wpds-c-cbTFcs-iPJLV-css" data-qa="raw-html"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/b&gt;Dr. Anna Wolfson says she sees dangerous misuse of the allergy medication diphenhydramine in her clinic every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If someone has an allergic reaction to a food, people will say, ‘Don’t worry, I have diphenhydramine in my purse,’ and I would say, ‘Really, epinephrine is the first-line treatment for food allergies,’” said Wolfson, an allergist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diphenhydramine can be harmful if people take it after having an allergic reaction to food, she said, because the drug – best known by the brand name Benadryl – makes them drowsy and can cause them to miss signs that their symptoms are getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to move on. For every single indication that people are using diphenhydramine, there are better drugs that are more effective at treating the symptoms people are trying to treat with fewer side effects,” she said. “I’ve had patients where I worried that diphenhydramine was impairing their ability to drive or fully participate in their daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolfson isn’t alone in preferring alternatives. In a &lt;a href="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; published in February, allergy experts from Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, San Diego called for the removal of diphenhydramine from over-the-counter and prescription markets in the United States, saying it’s outdated, dangerous and eclipsed by safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first-generation antihistamine approved in 1946, diphenhydramine is widely used for allergies, sleep aid and cold symptoms. It’s a common over-the-counter medication in the US, with usage rising in the summer months as people use it to treat itching from bug bites or poison ivy, as well as sneezing and runny nose caused by grass and pollen allergies, according to the American Pharmacists Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its longstanding presence in American homes, the authors of the new review say it poses disproportionate risks, especially for children and older adults, than newer antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Patients should trial alternatives agents like loratadine, which is Claritin, or cetirizine, which is Zyrtec, or fexofenadine, which is Allegra,” to alleviate allergy symptoms, Dr. James Clark of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the lead author of the paper, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents the OTC medicine industry, says that common side effects associated with products containing diphenhydramine are disclosed on the label. However, it notes, “these products are not intended for long-term use.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When used as directed, these medicines provide well-established therapeutic benefits for common health ailments like allergies, the common cold, motion sickness, minor skin irritations, and occasional sleeplessness,” the group said in a statement on behalf of Benadryl’s maker, Kenvue. “Like all medicines, responsible use is essential, and consumers should always follow directions and warnings on the Drug Facts labels and consult healthcare providers if they have questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Risks of diphenhydramine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines work by blocking receptors called H1, part of the body’s system for responding to allergens, which trigger symptoms like sneezing, itching and a runny nose. But older drugs like diphenhydramine don’t just block the allergy-related receptors, they can also affect other parts of the brain. Diphenhydramine often causes sedation, cognitive impairment, and in some cases, dangerous cardiac effects, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In older adults, the drug can stay in the body for up to 18 hours, resulting in lingering sleepiness, disorientation and increasing risk of falling. The review also highlighted a possible link between long-term diphenhydramine use and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25621434/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In children, the risks can be even more pronounced. The review’s authors cite cases of accidental overdose; paradoxical reactions such as agitation, extreme sedation and coma; and even death, particularly with pediatric formulations, because of accidental ingestions. The medication was linked to several child hospitalizations and fatalities during the viral &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/benadryl-tiktok-challenge-teen-death-wellness"&gt;“Benadryl Challenge”&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manuela Murray, director of general pediatrics and urgent care at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says diphenhydramine “should not be used lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It should always be used under the guidance of a Medical Professional, and it is only indicated to treat allergic reactions and motion sickness,” Murray wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medication is often misused and “doesn’t offer a benefit for treatment of cold symptoms, and it is not a safe sleep aid medication,” she said. In fact, it can have the opposite effects in children, leading to hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alyssa Kuban, a pediatrician and associate medical director at Texas Children’s Pediatrics, also said that she finds diphenhydramine overused for symptoms it does not directly treat and that there are safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see some families use diphenhydramine when the child has a cold or upper respiratory infection, thinking it will help with the congestion and help them to sleep better at night,” she said. “This is not effective for cold symptoms, nor is it very safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recommends over-the-counter cetirizine to treat children with hives, seasonal allergies or an itchy rash. Cetirizine is also longer-lasting and not as sedating as diphenhydramine, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murray agrees that loratadine and cetirizine are safer for children over 6 months, and saline drops and suctioning are better alternatives for infants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;‘Time to say a final goodbye’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diphenhydramine appears in over 300 OTC formulations, often blended into combination products for coughs, colds and flu. The authors of the review say that, like products with pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine should at minimum be moved behind the counter, allowing pharmacists to guide patients toward second-generation alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Pharmacists Association says patients should use caution with combination cough and cold products that contain diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists may recommend alternative medications for older adults who have a history of being cognitively affected by certain medications, the group says, and it “encourages patients and parents/caregivers to ask their pharmacist for the most appropriate treatment recommendation for their symptoms” with the least amount of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review authors also emphasize that there is no strong clinical data that may suggest that diphenhydramine works better than other options. Although it may reduce symptoms like sneezing and itching, it has minimal effect on nasal congestion and doesn’t outperform second-generation drugs in randomized trials. Newer options, such as oral cetirizine, offer 24-hour coverage with fewer adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the US, the medication remains a staple. According to the review, more than 1.5 million prescriptions are still written annually, not counting untracked OTC purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the past, it has been a useful medication that has helped millions of patients; however, its current therapeutic ratio is matched or exceeded by second-generation antihistamines, especially due to their markedly reduced adverse reactions. It is time to say a final goodbye to diphenhydramine, a public health hazard,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Barley can help lower LDL cholesterol because it’s rich in a special kind of fiber called beta-glucan. This fiber forms a thick gel in your gut that traps cholesterol and helps your body get rid of it.

Eating salmon and other fatty fish reduces levels of triglycerides (fat) in blood that contribute to clogged arteries. The American Heart Association recommends eating fatty fish like salmon at least twice per week for heart-healthy benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swapping out fatty meat for fish can reduce LDL cholesterol by lowering your intake of saturated fat, which increases blood cholesterol concentrations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Other fish that contain higher amounts of omega-3s, such as mackerel, tuna and sardines, can also help.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oatmeal is one of the best cholesterol-fighting foods because it's so &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-upgrade-to-add-to-your-smoothies-8786724" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in beta-glucans&lt;/a&gt;, the soluble fibers that cause oats to bulk up in liquid when you make oatmeal. Soluble fiber forms a gel in your gut that binds cholesterol and blocks its absorption through the intestinal wall, thus lowering LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prepare &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269639/old-fashioned-oatmeal/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;old-fashioned oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; on the stove or in the microwave and skip the instant packs with lots of added sugar and less fiber. Add fruit to your oatmeal to naturally sweeten it and boost the soluble fiber content even more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many fruits contain soluble fiber, which is important for lowering cholesterol, but apples have a leg up on other fruits. Apples (especially the skins) contain pectin, a type of soluble fiber that latches onto the "bad" cholesterol and guides it through your digestive system and out of your body,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; effectively lowering your LDL-cholesterol levels. Citrus fruits are also high in pectin, but since it's mostly in the pulp, you'll have to eat your fruits to get the benefits, rather than juice them. Luckily, apples are a little easier to pucker up to than lemons. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-fruit-to-eat-to-help-lower-your-cholesterol-11772297" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Apples are also high in polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, powerful antioxidants that help reduce inflammation.

Beans are high in protein and have nearly no saturated fat, which makes them a heart-healthy replacement for animal protein sources, such as meat. For the biggest cholesterol-lowering benefits, add beans to chili, tacos and burritos (either in place of or in addition to meat). They're also great in soups and salads.

Nuts also contain plant sterols, which are natural compounds that help block the cholesterol you eat from entering your bloodstream. While nuts are awesome to eat, don't go overboard.

One study found that over the course of 30 years, people who ate the most avocado had a 21% lower risk for heart disease than those who ate none.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avocados are high in healthy monounsaturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, which helps lower "bad" LDL cholesterol.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate fans rejoice! You might have heard that chocolate is good for you, and it's true. According to research, dark chocolate and cocoa powder contain powerful antioxidant compounds called flavonoids, which help lower LDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Milk chocolate has less cocoa solids, and thus lower flavonoid levels, and white chocolate has none.

The good bacteria produced during fermentation also help lower cholesterol. Kimchi and sauerkraut are usually pretty high in sodium, so watch your portions if you're watching your salt intake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no magic food for cholesterol, but fiber, healthy fats and antioxidants can help. Eating more plant-based foods, swapping out saturated fat and adding fermented foods may raise HDL and lower LDL—supporting long-term heart health. Salmon, oatmeal, beans and avocado are just a few of our favorite picks for supporting healthy cholesterol levels.

And some recent studies show that it's having major impacts on moms' mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while millennial mothers are definitely struggling, Gen Z moms are finding parenthood even more challenging than their older counterparts, especially when it comes to some key issues modern parents face. There's no shortage of online discourse about the overwhelming load of parenting and especially motherhood these days, and recent data shows it is wreaking havoc on moms' mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by Columbia University and the University of Michigan, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2834318" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;released in May,&lt;/a&gt; tracked nearly 200,000 mothers from 2016 to 2023 and had some startling findings. In 2016, 1 in 20 mothers rated their mental health as "poor;" by 2023, that had skyrocketed to 1 in 12. Dads, on the other hand, were doing much better: Just 1 in 22 rated their mental health as "poor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the isolation of the pandemic was part of the picture, researchers found that it was bigger, more long-standing problems like the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/mom-hit-breaking-point-after-husband-forgot-feed-toddler"&gt;unequal workload between moms and dads&lt;/a&gt;, lack of adequate parental leave, economic uncertainty, and soaring costs that were the main reasons for the steep decline in maternal mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/family/signs-raised-type-c-mom"&gt;6 Signs You Were Raised By A Type C Mom Who Silently Struggled But Obviously Cared With All Her Heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most moms feel pressure to be the 'perfect' parent, but it's hitting Gen Z hardest.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/news/first-year/gen-z-millennials-perfect-parent" rel="nofollow"&gt;survey conducted by parenting website What To Expect&lt;/a&gt; gives Columbia and U of M's findings even more context.

Nevertheless, 83% of Gen Z moms said they're striving for a perfect 10 motherhood score, compared to 77% of millennials. And when it comes to the various attributes that supposedly make up the "perfect" mom, Gen Z is struggling with all but two of them more than their millennial counterparts, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Keeping kids busy with lots of activities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern trend of kids having to be constantly occupied, rather than being left to play and explore solo, is hitting Gen Z moms quite a bit harder than millennials: 48% versus 34%, showing a marked difference in how much time and energy Gen Zers are requiring themselves to spend entertaining and engaging their little ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Ensuring kids have plenty of free time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making sure kids have as much open-ended time for all those activities is a huge concern, too, and it's stressing out 39% of Gen Z moms, compared to 30% of millennial moms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Ensuring tech-free time for children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the good old screen time debate rears its head once again. And while all moms are worried about their &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/dad-makes-kids-complete-to-do-list-before-screen-time"&gt;kids spending too much time&lt;/a&gt;, What to Expect found it's surprisingly an even larger worry for the "digital natives" of Gen Z: 50% versus 41% of millennials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/seven-things-gen-z-moms-worry-about-more-than-millennials-perfect-tech-free.png" alt="mom having tech-free time with child" title="seven things gen z moms worry about more than millennials tech free" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Kampus Production | Pexels | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Managing the planning, scheduling, and coordination for the family&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, the often-forgotten part of the unequal load moms tend to bear when it comes to the work of running the home and managing the children. It's not just the vacuuming and diaper changes, but the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/woman-explains-what-mental-load-dads-who-do-bare-minimum"&gt;mental work involved in keeping the family running&lt;/a&gt; as well. Once again, Gen Z is struggling more than millennials, 51% versus 42%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Being open to child(ren) exploring their own identity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millennials were perhaps the pioneers of letting kids simply discover who they are rather than placing cultural, social, or religious expectations on them, like previous generations. But for Gen Z, which is even more forward-thinking about these issues than their millennials siblings, the pressure is more intense, with 53% worrying about this versus 45% of millennials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/millennial-mom-reveals-lazy-gen-z-habits"&gt;Millennial Mom Reveals 6 'Lazy' Gen-Z Habits That Drive Her Absolutely Bonkers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Prioritizing family over themselves&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we have arguably the biggest factor in moms' declining mental health, and it seems millennial moms are a lot better at &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-set-much-needed-boundary-without-saying-single-word"&gt;setting boundaries&lt;/a&gt; and making room for self-care than Gen Z moms are: 33% of millennial moms reported struggling with this, versus 41% of Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Teaching kids to adapt easily to setbacks and difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising adaptable, resilient kids is a huge priority these days, but it's even more so for Gen Z moms. One of the consistent issues that mental health experts have noticed with Gen Zers as they reach adulthood is a tendency toward anxiety likely caused, at least in part, by their parents having done too much for them and eroded their opportunities to learn from mistakes and grow in self-sufficiency. So it's perhaps unsurprising that nearly two-thirds of Gen Z moms worry about instilling this in their own children, versus 58% of millennials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some experts believe this added stress is related to Gen Z growing up with social media scrutiny.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having spent such an enormous proportion of their lives with the internet being commonplace, Gen Zers have essentially grown up in a fishbowl, coming of age on social media in an environment that is often described as a sort of panopticon: Everyone is watching everyone, and no one can get away with anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sheri Lusskin, a perinatal psychiatrist at Mount Sinai Medical Center and member of the What to Expect Medical Review Board, said this is likely part of why Gen Z moms are struggling so much more than millennials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Younger parents who have grown up in the age of social media are used to having their every move discussed and critiqued, and that's no different for parenting," she told What to Expect. "It's consistent with people living in a world of social media, where their every gesture is recorded and shared, and every behavior elicits a comment from someone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does social media seem to be making Gen Z moms more anxious, but it also seems to be eroding the thing that many moms told What to Expect is among their biggest problems: the decline of the "village" that moms have always relied on for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom-shaming has been a thing for as long as mother has, of course, but it's on a whole other level today. And Dr. Lusskin says the key to navigating it is remembering one essential truth: Perfection isn't real. "You don't have to be perfect — you have to be good enough," Dr. Lusskin said. And with all we know about parenting these days compared to earlier generations, "good enough" is already far better than it ever used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/family/mom-sick-parents-not-parenting-because-afraid-traumatize-kids"&gt;Mom ‘Sick’ Of Parents Not Really Parenting Anymore Because They’re Too Afraid To Traumatize Their Kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Sundholm is a writer, editor, and video personality with 20 years of experience in media and entertainment.

    &lt;p&gt;As more people aged 45-49 are getting screened for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colon-cancer-what-millennials-need-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, more early stage diagnoses are being made, according to new research from the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in two studies Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed increases in screenings among those younger than 50 is linked to rises in earlier diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837232" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed an annual increase of 1.1% from 2004 to 2019 jumped to 12% from 2019 to 2022 for colorectal cancer incidence among people aged 45 to 49, while &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837231" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; showed screenings among U.S. adults aged 45 to 49 increase 62% from 2019 to 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended age to begin &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colon-cancer-younger-adults-rates-rise-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;colorectal screening was lowered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from 50 to 45 by the ACS in 2018 and by the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-preventive-health-panel-concerns-medical-associations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/early-diagnosis-surge-for-CRC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; Monday, Elizabeth Schafer, lead author and surveillance and health equity scientist, called the findings "promising news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The uptick of cases is likely due to first-time screening in the wake of new recommendations for younger average-risk adults to begin testing for colorectal cancer earlier," Schafer explained. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another lead author, Jessica Star, who does cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the ACS, said it's "thrilling" to see increases in screening rates among younger adults as well as its likely ties into rises in earlier stage diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she warned there's a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screening for colorectal caner in ages 45-49 remains suboptimal and has not increased equitably by both education attainment and insurance status," Star said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, medical associations expressed concern after a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-preventive-health-panel-concerns-medical-associations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;may remove all members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide insurance companies and doctors' decisions about a range of preventive health measures, like cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Lew, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and attending physician of hospital medicine at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, recently told CBS News that a change like this would "greatly damage all the work we've done in preventative care, making people sicker, and driving up costs and premiums."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To put it mildly, this is extremely concerning — and doing the opposite of making America healthy," Lew said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to CBS News at the time, an HHS spokesperson said, "No final decision has been made on how the USPSTF can better support HHS' mandate to Make America Healthy Again."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the long term, mobility difficulties may significantly reduce adherence to physical activity, a lifestyle factor that may impact patients’ outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adherence to healthy habits appears to be associated with fewer &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and slowed disease progression, according to the study. These include eating a high-quality diet, taking vitamin D supplements, engaging in physical activity and meditation, and not smoking,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Determining barriers and facilitators for long-term adherence to healthy lifestyle may inform efforts to support [people living with MS] improve lifestyle engagement,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(25)00357-8/abstract"&gt;Self-reported symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis do not impact five-year adherence to healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MS patients with fatigue more likely to be women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the immune system mistakenly attacking the myelin sheath, the protective layer around nerve fibers that enables efficient transmission of electrical signals. This damage leads to progressive nerve degeneration and the onset of MS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who adhere to a healthy lifestyle, including a high-quality diet, stress management, and regular physical activity, appear to have fewer disease symptoms, slowed disease progression, and better quality of life, according to the study. However, MS symptoms may prevent long-term adherence to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further explore this connection, researchers at the University of Melbourne in Australia conducted an observational study using patients’ self-reported health and lifestyle data obtained from the&lt;a href="https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/centre-for-epidemiology-and-biostatistics-research/neuroepidemiology/the-holism-study"&gt; Health Outcomes and Lifestyle In a Sample of people with MS&lt;/a&gt; study. Nearly 2,500 participants were recruited online and detailed information was collected on their demographics, disease status, lifestyle habits, and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 671 participants, the majority of whom were women (81%) and had a mean age of 46 years, were included in the analysis. The three most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue (43%), mobility issues (35%), and cognitive impairment (24%), determined at the five-year follow-up. Almost all patients reporting these three symptoms were non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with fatigue were more likely to be women, to have more than one coexistent condition, and to have clinically meaningful fatigue and use anti-fatigue medications.  Those with mobility issues were more likely to be older than 58 years and have an MS diagnosis for over 10 years, progressive MS, moderate to severe disability, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group of patients reporting cognitive impairment was more likely to have depression and take antidepressant medications, and less likely to have progressive MS and moderate to severe disability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Physical activity declines for participants with mobility issues as top symptom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the five-year assessment, participants experiencing fatigue were 27% less likely to engage in physical activities and 18% less likely to commit to at least three lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with MS who said mobility was their main symptom were 29% more likely to take vitamin D supplements and 28% less likely to be physically active. However, only the link with lower physical activity stayed true over time. Individuals reporting cognitive issues were 25% less likely to follow a healthy diet, however, this association was also not maintained over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes were also observed at the 7.5-year follow-up, with a 37% increase in the proportion of patients taking vitamin D supplementation, a 19% increase for those engaging in at least three lifestyle factors, and a 9% increase for meditation. The proportion of individuals engaging in physical activity decreased by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;These symptoms, except for mobility with physical activity, were not barriers to engagement with healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analysis at the 7.5-year follow-up was extended to the most important symptom, the only association that persisted was between mobility issues and reduced likelihood of physical activity, though an association was also found between cognitive function and an increased likelihood of being a non-smoker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These symptoms, except for mobility with physical activity, were not barriers to engagement with healthy lifestyle,” the researchers wrote. “While lifestyle modifications can benefit health outcomes in [people living with MS], it is important to discuss symptoms most relevant to the individual and how lifestyle modifications may be adapted to accommodate change in health.”&lt;/p&gt;

A new study suggests it may be sooner than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied proteins in tissue taken from about 70 people ages 14 to 68, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00749-4?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867425007494?showall=true" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00749-4?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867425007494?showall=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the study published July 25 in the journal Cell.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These proteins give scientists a window of when the aging process may begin on a cellular level, said Dr. Thomas Blackwell, associate dean for graduate medical education and professor of medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Proteins are created in a “factory” using instructions from messenger RNA, he said. A sign of aging is when the cells’ ability to make proteins correctly and efficiently starts to break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By looking at tissues taken from organs throughout the body, including the heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, lung, skin and muscles, researchers determined that aging starts to accelerate from 45 to 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They also found that organs aged at different rates. For example, the spleen, aorta (the body’s main artery) and adrenal gland (responsible for producing hormones) showed signs of aging at around 30. The aorta also saw the biggest changes in protein levels around the ages of 45 and 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This is just a beautiful roadmap that gives us an initial overview of organ aging,” said Neville Sanjana, associate professor of biology, neuroscience and physiology at New York University and a faculty member at the New York Genome Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The study’s findings could have a lot of implications in future research into treatments for chronic conditions related to aging that would not only add decades to patients' lifespan, but also their health span, which is the period of a person’s life spent in good health, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“To me, that’s exciting,” Sanjana said. “This kind of data generation is so powerful for folks who want to do things like bioengineering and creating new kinds of therapies to restore healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For Blackwell, the study also shows that patients still have the chance to change their aging trajectory later in life – “but the window is short,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The best ways to add healthy years to your life are to maintain a healthy level of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol, don't smoke and drink "very little," Blackwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Research has shown diet, exercise, genetics and, sometimes, luck, impact longevity. However, the new study suggests people may still see benefits from changes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Starting at 45 to 50, you could gain as much as 10 years of healthy life and this study just shows the truth of that at a cellular level,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 15:02:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNbG9ScFJtTnpDdGxMRDdKYm9hbzRnSm9XWExSdFZON2lGV3k1ZndpQXR5b3NJMFNMaTR2VmdlampXYUl1M0VmcW0zUTNWYktUdHVCVFcza3F2X0drNjJuSHJaQ05jVFc2RGFENFNhTWZsLTAxLXhJemlaakx4RlRwYVRsQUliUnJGM0JRLXdFVmx1UzlHY3V5eEZENXFYdUF1eUJwNA</guid></item><item><title>随着越来越多的年轻人接受筛查，更多的结肠癌正在早期被发现。以下是降低风险的方法- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE82WGVtZGNVMnVWYTFKbFJJX19FVTcxUnBtRXM2dllPb1RiT0pjZXJCdXRyaHRDSEZQTEdKdlBCaThkUXBuV1FkWXB4aGdYSWpQQUg2RkNuemJoQWtCYjV5blhWczlodnBoWTItQms5b2luTTdRckxNMFh3SdIBgAFBVV95cUxOcWZDNTljZkk2V0g5TjRTNlBkSnYtNGZKVkdBeVJfeHBnT3hmNkg2X05XS1QwMVZJU0dfU1NfSnJvQ0FEVlp0YnZ0ZkR2VzhReWRGNFcwamo5RWFMcElXVWI0Z3pNYlhHdWItUVN0UFNCdmN4ckx3cGZlWFV3VEdGZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00043b6ne9fsr2j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even more colorectal cancer cases are being found in adults under 50, and a new collection of research suggests that a surge in screening may be tied to many of the more recent diagnoses – but not the overall trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00063b6n6t7e2t1r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2018, the American Cancer Society &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2018/05/30/colon-cancer-screenings-guidelines-nr.cnn"&gt;updated its guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for colon and rectal cancer screening, recommending that adults at average risk get screened starting at age 45 – earlier than 50, which was previously advised.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00073b6ntyytjup7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in 2021, the US Preventive Services Task force also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/health/colorectal-cancer-screening-45-wellness"&gt;lowered the recommended age&lt;/a&gt; to start screening for colon and rectal cancers from 50 to 45.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdtfc6uz00053b6noqe3awtk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The shift in screening guidelines is associated with a recent increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses, but it does not explain the rise among younger adults in general – a trend that began in the mid-1990s and includes late-stage cancers, as well. Colorectal cancer refers to colon cancer, which starts in the colon, and rectal cancer, which starts in the rectum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdtfcjej00073b6nd1olz3fc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The drivers of rising incidence are still unknown, but many research efforts are ongoing, with investigations covering the gamut from microplastics to ultra processed food and many other gut exposures introduced in the last half of the 20th century, when this began,” Elizabeth Schafer, associate scientist of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000h3b6nrtzrkpbi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lowering the screening age “has likely facilitated earlier detection of cancers that might have been missed,” but there is still more work to do to identify the driving factors behind the ongoing overall rise of colorectal cancer in younger ages, Dr. Joseph Rinaldi, a gastroenterologist at Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000i3b6nj53oe450@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is likely that factors beyond screening guidelines are contributing to the overall rise in colorectal cancer incidence,” Rinaldi said. “Much work remains to identify causal factors – whether environmental, genetic, or population-based – that can be targeted for prevention and, potentially, reversal of this trend.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00083b6ng1lr2aid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, research&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;conducted by the American Cancer Society that was published Monday in the medical journal JAMA found that the share of US adults ages 45 to 49 who are up to date on colorectal cancer screening climbed from 20.8% in 2019 and 19.7% in 2021 to 33.7% in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00093b6npy2v7io7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been waiting for screening to take off in this age group,” Schafer, an author on the new screening study, said in the email. “But the real thrill is the translation to early diagnosis, which means less intense treatment and lives saved.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000c3b6nvxtjgpct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A second study, also conducted by the American Cancer Society and published Monday in JAMA, found that the prevalence of early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults 45 to 49 increased from 9.4 cases per 100,000 people in 2019 to 11.7 per 100,000 in 2021 and then to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000d3b6nnzf754uq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That translates to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.9147?guestAccessKey=cdcd25ed-4acb-4a31-a67f-2b993aace50c&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=080425" target="_blank"&gt;50% relative increase&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000e3b6nshgb6vvy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If screening was the cause of the rise, the increase would have been for early- instead of late-stage disease,” said Schafer, lead author of the second paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdtffssm00093b6n016vhk93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Local stage diagnosis was rare in this age group before screening because there are usually no symptoms yet,” Schafer said of early-stage cancers that have not spread to other parts of the body. “So yes, it was a bit shocking, actually, to see early-stage incidence double from 9.4 to 17.5 per 100,000 in this newly screened group.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7s3b0001s26p888wvfpjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a rise in colon and rectal cancers persists among younger adults, public health experts now urge them to know the warning signs and to get screened when eligible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdt7u8c4001d3b6nfu9pprrl@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-signs-and-symptoms-to-watch-for" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The signs and symptoms to watch for
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000k3b6nohc0gb20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half of the people who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 50 are not eligible for screening because they haven’t yet reached the recommended age of 45. And most people who are eligible have still not been screened, said Jessica Star, associate scientist of cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, who was lead author on the new screening study and an author on the other paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000l3b6nqxn41ka1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether someone is recommended for screening or not, they should still watch for signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer and talk with their doctor if they notice any, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000m3b6nidba93h9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women&lt;/a&gt; will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000n3b6n9na3pncx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most common symptom is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;rectal bleeding,” Star said in an email, adding that 41% of patients under 50 tend to experience this symptom, compared with 26% of patients older than 50. Many people also may have abdominal cramping or pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000o3b6ncn7vcmbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Young people, especially, are reluctant to talk about these types of symptoms, but it could actually save their life,” Star said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000p3b6n3h9gztse@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Other important symptoms include a persistent change in bowel habits or the shape of stool, decreased appetite, and weight loss. People with any of these symptoms that persist for several weeks should be followed up with a doctor’s visit,” she said. “If you are young and your concerns are not being addressed, get a second opinion. There are too many stories about young people being told they have hemorrhoids, finding out months or years later that it is cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000r3b6n6an3yntf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Kelly Spill, 33, experienced symptoms of colorectal cancer after the birth of her first child, she said, her doctors told her that they were tied to being postpartum and internal hemorrhoids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000s3b6nw71dd7cy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One day I went to the bathroom, and I looked down, and you would have thought it was my time of the month, and it most certainly was not. That’s when it became extremely alarming,” Spill &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/05/health/immunotherapy-cancer-patients-study-wellness"&gt;told CNN in May&lt;/a&gt; of the blood in her stool.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000t3b6naqc2y3ab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When she noticed massive amounts of blood again, she took photos and showed them to a primary care physician. The doctor immediately ordered a colonoscopy, and that’s what led to her being diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer at age 28 in 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000u3b6nyvd7xp8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To self-advocate is such a big one,” Spill said. “If I didn’t push, push, push, I don’t know where I would be, and especially as a new mom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000v3b6ntix1ovb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spill was treated with an immunotherapy drug called dostarlimab and is now a healthy mother of three. She remains cancer-free.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000x3b6ncwtl48rt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Getting screened can help &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, because almost all colorectal cancers begin as precancerous polyps in the colon or rectum. But through screening, these polyps can be identified and removed before they turn cancerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000y3b6nsyl7o0sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current options for colorectal cancer screening for people at average risk include a stool-based fecal test either annually or every three years; a traditional colonoscopy every 10 years; a virtual colonoscopy every five years; or a sigmoidoscopy procedure, which involves using a tube-like instrument called an endoscope to examine the lower part of the colon, every five years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms000z3b6nu4exsx1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate study published Monday in JAMA found that when people newly eligible for screening were automatically mailed a fecal test kit at their home address without asking for it, they were more likely to complete screening than those who were asked to actively choose between a colonoscopy, a fecal test or deferring screening altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00103b6nhoakra20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Another important question is how to get more people screened, especially people without access to healthcare, a group that had no significant increase in screening in our study,” Schafer, who was not involved in that study, said in the email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00113b6nirqv4f0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite recent increases in screening, it’s still estimated that more than 1 in 3 adults 45 and older are not getting screened as recommended, according to the &lt;a href="https://nccrt.org/our-impact/80-in-every-community/" target="_blank"&gt;National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There are other steps people can take to help prevent colorectal cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00143b6ny5nj4t1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are many things people of all ages can do to reduce their risk, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, and eating a healthy diet that is low in red and processed meat and high in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables,” Star said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdt7slms00153b6ntdn5f1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half of all colorectal cancers in the US are attributable to those modifiable risk factors, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There have been several studies that work to identify factors contributing to the development of colon cancer. Maintaining a physically active lifestyle and a healthy weight is important, as obesity has been linked to early-onset disease,” Rinaldi said. “I also encourage avoiding tobacco, refined grains, and sugary beverages and instead focus on consuming a fiber-rich diet that is more plant-based and that limits the consumption of red and processed meats, as this is thought to be protective to colon health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The sample consisted of both patients with and without cancer to provide a control group. Within the sample group, breast cancer was the most common form of cancer (74.1 percent), followed by colorectal (14.5 percent) and lung cancer (11.4 percent). On average, out-of-pocket costs rose by a  cumulative total of $4,144.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WMNAMTNKRJF4VJQGG67ZH2JHMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This difference, driven by the onset of cancer diagnosis and its associated treatment, underscores the financial burden of cancer care on patients with insurance who are not yet eligible for Medicare,” the authors write in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YJORG3S2EFDHDNEQKGHDIV2MGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cost also increased with stage of diagnosis.

However, Dr. Davis says that LDL cholesterol carries a dubious distinction: "Bad cholesterol."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Elevated levels can contribute to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/dietary-habit-that-leads-to-plaque-buildup-in-arteries-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plaque buildup in the arteries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plaque buildup in the arteries&lt;/a&gt;—a process called atherosclerosis," he adds, noting that the arteries then narrow, upping the risk for heart attacks and strokes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, cholesterol itself isn't inherently bad—in fact, it serves a vital function. "Cholesterol is essential for hormone production, cell membranes and neurological function," Dr. Davis clarifies. "What matters most is how it's transported and used in the body, and this is determined by the LDL particle number and size, which gives a more accurate picture of cardiovascular risk than LDL alone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol/what-your-cholesterol-levels-mean" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association guidelines&lt;/a&gt; state that the optimal total cholesterol level is 150 mg/dL. In healthy individuals, LDL cholesterol levels don't go higher than 100 mg/dL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-fruit-to-lower-cholesterol-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eating More of This Fruit Might Be the Easiest Way To Lower Cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Eating More of This Fruit Might Be the Easiest Way To Lower Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The No. 1 Daily Habit To Start To Lower LDL Cholesterol, Cardiologists Reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your day with a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/high-fiber-breakfast-recipes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber-rich breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber-rich breakfast&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr. Suppogu notes that soluble fiber has a ton going for it, so starting your day with a breakfast full of it is the heart's version of waking up on the right side of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suppogu says fiber combats LDL cholesterol because:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fibers resist digestion and form a gel-like paste, delaying gastric emptying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber improves insulin resistance and decreases cholesterol synthesis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is satisfying, helping people manage hunger and calorie intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber affects how cholesterol and LDL levels are absorbed into the liver and bloodstream, helping to keep numbers down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/popular-morning-habit-blood-pressure-spike" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Popular Morning Habit Could Spike Your Blood Pressure—Here’s What a Cardiologist Wants You To Know;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Popular Morning Habit Could Spike Your Blood Pressure—Here’s What a Cardiologist Wants You To Know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Build a Cholesterol-Friendly, Fiber-Rich Breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet the standard for a "fiber-rich" breakfast and increase the chances it helps lower LDL cholesterol, cardiologists recommend being mindful. It's essential to understand how much fiber to consume at breakfast and throughout the day, as well as the types of foods to prioritize and minimize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Know your numbers for fiber intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as it's crucial to understand your cholesterol numbers, cardiologists stress the importance of knowing your optimal fiber intake. Dr. Davis says the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/health/essential-nutrients/carbohydrates/easy-ways-to-boost-fiber-in-your-daily-diet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:general guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;general guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for daily fiber consumption are 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, most Americans &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fall well short;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fall well short&lt;/a&gt; of that goal, so making fiber a priority at every meal can go a long way," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At breakfast, Dr. Davis suggests aiming for 5 to 10 grams of fiber. Note that fiber can cause bloating, especially if you don't currently consume enough. Starting on the lower end and working your way up can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Try these fiber-rich breakfast ideas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a cholesterol-friendly breakfast rich in fiber can be a delicious habit. Dr. Rinde-Hoffman loves these fiber-filled breakfasts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/greek-yogurt-bites" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yogurt&lt;/a&gt; with granola, nuts and/or fruit&lt;br&gt;• Toast (such as &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/banana-avocado-toast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avocado toast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avocado toast&lt;/a&gt;) made with whole-grain bread&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/kevin-bacon-oatmeal-eggs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/844284/marciebidou/17-outrageously-good-overnight-oats-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:overnight oats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;overnight oats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Smoothies made with high-fiber berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Deprioritize certain meats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get it—bacon is delicious. However, more often than not, it's best to opt for other foods at breakfast. Additionally, meat isn't entirely off the table if you're trying to manage your LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you must have breakfast meats, choose leaner types such as turkey or chicken, but make these rare treats as they are processed, making them not ideal for health," explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mohanakrishna Sathyamoorthy, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Mohanakrishna Sathyamoorthy, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the chair of the department of internal medicine and Burnett School of Medicine and the principal cardiologist with Consultants in Cardiovascular Medicine and Science Fort Worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-stop-doing-if-you-sit-at-work-all-day-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing if They Sit for Work All Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cardiologists Are Begging People To Stop Doing This One Thing if They Sit for Work All Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Tips for Lowering LDL Cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming a fiber-rich breakfast (and diet) is one way to lower or maintain LDL levels. However, cardiologists recommend a multi-pronged approach to heart health and say that movement and stress management are also crucial tools for cholesterol management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Prioritize regular physical activity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/span&gt; recommends logging at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise each week. You don't have to do it all at once. For instance, Dr. Sathyamoorthy recommends 25 to 30 minutes of moderate-intensity (conversation pace) aerobic exercise, five to six days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start slow, then slowly work your way up as your body allows—don’t overdo it," Dr. Sathyamoorthy advises. "The key is becoming intentional about exercise—make the time and commit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Keep moving (especially if you have a desk job)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting weekly physical activity guidelines is an essential step in managing your cholesterol and overall heart health. However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743523003985" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that even people who exercise are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease if they live a sedentary lifestyle, which makes "sitting at a desk" a sneaky occupational hazard. However, you don't have to quit your day job. Instead, try to incorporate movement into your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you work a relatively sedentary job, try to spend less time sitting down throughout the day," Dr. Rinde-Hoffman points out. "Walking as little as 7,000 steps per day is advantageous because sitting for long periods can slow metabolism and contribute to increased LDL cholesterol levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a lap around the office every hour, opting for the stairs or going for a post-lunch stroll can help you move closer to your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Manage your stress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to control your LDL levels? Don't overlook your stress levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Stress management is important because &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol/causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress can increase;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stress can increase&lt;/a&gt; the body’s production of LDL cholesterol and decrease the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol," Dr. Rinde-Hoffman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Davis also suggests daily meditation or mindfulness practices.

But eating the right foods each day can help keep chronic inflammation at bay, says Vanessa King, clinical nutrition manager for the Queen’s Health System in Honolulu and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. And the foundation of anti-inflammatory eating? Antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, olive oil, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins, and food high in omega-3 fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDMGYRRJD5B2ZCZGH3TDSSEDCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Mediterranean diet emphasizes those foods and is backed by extensive research.

Antioxidants help balance unstable molecules that can damage the body’s tissues, and the decreased stress on the body leads to lower inflammation. In Dunaief’s study, eating roughly 2½ cups of dark, leafy green vegetables per day helped slash levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of bodywide inflammation, by 66 percent in about six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C6M66XRDXJDBXHJI5HOE334QS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-eating/are-beans-good-for-you-a8342413430/" target="_blank"&gt;Beans and legumes&lt;/a&gt;, such as chickpeas and lentils, offer plenty of healthy protein.

A &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(21)00754-6.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2021 study in the journal Cell&lt;/a&gt; found that blood levels of 19 inflammatory proteins decreased significantly in healthy adults who consumed a lot of fermented foods. (They ate an average of six servings per day for 10 weeks.) Those who were asked to eat a high-fiber diet didn’t have the same decrease in inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YTLNISAQQRAJBMMV4NFGRA55UU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To get more: Have yogurt, kefir or cottage cheese (labeled “cultured” or “probiotic”) at breakfast, and sauerkraut or other pickled vegetables (look for jars labeled “fermented” or “raw” in a store’s refrigerated section) with lunch or dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFZV7FG5GNGVTENDBOGC7P5APU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research suggests that eating tomatoes and tomato products may help lower inflammation. When 22 healthy men ate a serving of sofrito, a type of tomato-based sauce, their levels of two important markers of inflammation dropped, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/4/851" target="_blank"&gt;2019 Spanish study in the journal Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;. Lycopene is one of the main anti-inflammatory compounds in tomatoes, and cooked tomato foods are typically the most concentrated source of the nutrient. Like some other tomato sauces, sofrito also has onions, garlic and olive oil, which are also anti-inflammatory. (See CR’s &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/pasta-sauce/best-jarred-pasta-sauces-a2568686470/" target="_blank"&gt;ratings of jarred tomato sauces&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RQVM7S5XHBGGJPYB3VNNJW55TA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some people with arthritis may avoid eating tomatoes and other nightshade vegetables like potatoes and eggplant, thinking that they trigger inflammation and joint pain.

			&lt;p&gt;More than 13 million people worldwide owe their lives to in vitro fertilization (IVF), according to the first estimates of their kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the original 'test tube' baby was born in 1978, the number of children brought into the world by IVF technologies &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;collectively known as assisted reproductive technology (ART) &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt; has exploded into the millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, an ART-conceived baby is born every 35 seconds, and IVF, where an egg is fertilized by sperm in a test tube, is the most commonly used method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out how many ART babies have been born since the technology's infancy, an international team of researchers compiled health data from 101 different nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/8-babies-born-in-uk-using-radical-three-parent-ivf-technique?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;8 Babies Born in UK Using Radical 'Three Parent' IVF Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2018, the team estimates between 10 and 13 million babies have been born via ART, while preliminary data from 2018 to 2023 adds another 3 to 4 million children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every year we estimate how many babies were born in the previous 12 months – but we've never actually gone back and used a consistent methodology and extrapolation for missing data to estimate the total number of babies born in the world," &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2025/07/total-ivf-births-soar-to-more-than-13-million"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author Georgina Chambers, an epidemiologist from the University of New South Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimates are not perfect, but Chambers and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2025.02.009"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; they are "a reasonable and sound approximation" based on the "most robust data available in the literature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information comes from the International Committee Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ICMART), of which Chambers is the data custodian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 1980s, Australia became the first country in the world to establish an IVF registry. While many high-income nations have since followed suit, some countries, like Singapore,either lack formal registries that report to ICMART or the registries have been delayed for many years, as in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when formal lists are kept, some regional clinics do not report to ICMART, as in the United States, India, and some African countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for these gaps in knowledge, researchers tallied the number of clinics within a nation, using that coverage rate to predict ART rates. They also accounted for miscarriage rates where only ART pregnancies were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings reveal that in the 40 years since the dawn of ART, between 9.4 million and 12.4 million infants from 101 countries were born using reproductive technology, with an exponential increase starting around the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169446" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ARTEstimatesGlobal-642x424.png" alt="IVF Predictions" class="size-medium wp-image-169446" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ARTEstimatesGlobal-642x424.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ARTEstimatesGlobal-628x415.png 628w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ARTEstimatesGlobal-768x507.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ARTEstimatesGlobal-600x396.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ARTEstimatesGlobal.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169446" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Global number of infants born from ART.

The study found that a two-minute exercise known as the “Just-Like-Me” meditation not only boosted perceived warmth and connection but also synchronized participants’ smiles and heart rates, suggesting that subtle forms of emotional alignment may help explain the practice’s interpersonal effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by &lt;a href="http://www.veraludwig.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vera U. Ludwig&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions. It was conducted in the context of the &lt;a href="https://neuro.wharton.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Wharton Neuroscience Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, where Ludwig previously worked, in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.plattlabs.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Michael Platt&lt;/a&gt;. The team sought to investigate how dyadic meditations—mindfulness practices performed between two people—might enhance social connection, especially during a time of widespread loneliness and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that social isolation can have serious consequences for health and mental well-being, and the COVID-19 pandemic only heightened the need for interventions that foster meaningful interaction. While solitary meditation has been linked to greater compassion and prosocial behavior, dyadic formats may more directly engage the social systems that promote trust, empathy, and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a specific dyadic practice called the “Just-Like-Me” meditation. In this practice, participants silently look into each other’s eyes while contemplating sentences designed to evoke a sense of shared humanity. These prompts included thoughts like “Just like me, this person has felt sadness, loneliness, and pain,” or “Just like me, this person longs for peace, love, and self-expression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I personally experienced the ‘Just-Like-Me’ meditation in a workshop (led by Mironel de Wilde) many years ago,” explained Ludwig, the director of &lt;a href="https://sexual-wellbeing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Human Sexuality and Well-Being Project&lt;/a&gt; at the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “The intensity of looking into someone’s eyes and contemplating their humanity impressed me deeply. Many people in the room had tears in their eyes. So, I wanted to explore this method as one way to overcome or address loneliness, polarization, and disconnection in our society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often, people – especially in the business world – view meditation methods like this as somewhat ‘woo-woo’ or unconventional. That is why I wanted to provide solid scientific evidence that they actually work. I hoped this would give people a reason to try them and take these methods seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it is really needed,” Ludwig continued. “For example, in the United States right now, Democrats hardly speak with Republicans anymore, and vice versa. I have the impression that both sides dehumanize the other side, sometimes almost saying that the other side is not worthy of compassion or understanding at all. People hate on groups of other people based on their religion, immigration status, gender, or other factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What if we all stopped for a moment and noticed: ‘Just like me’ all these people are humans, going through this world struggling to find their way. They all have feelings, hopes, needs, dreams, wishes; they all have felt lonely, they are often very much doing their best given the circumstances they have been experiencing. I might be naïve, but I believe in the good deep down in (almost) all people, even if their actions can be problematic. Let’s connect, not hate. Talk to each other, instead of assuming. Let’s figure this out together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared Just-Like-Me meditation to two control conditions: one in which participants simply gazed at each other without any reflective prompts, and, in a second study, a third condition in which participants sat next to one another and practiced solitary breath-focused meditation with their eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first was conducted virtually over Zoom with 55 participants who were paired into 101 dyads. In this study, participants engaged in either the Just-Like-Me meditation or the simple gazing condition, each lasting two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after each interaction, participants completed self-report questionnaires rating their sense of closeness, perceptions of their partner’s warmth, competence, and attractiveness, and how much of a hypothetical $100 they would share with their partner in a version of the dictator game. Facial expressions were recorded using webcam footage and analyzed with facial recognition software to assess smile synchrony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second study, the researchers conducted an in-person version of the experiment with 98 participants and 238 dyad pairings. This study added the solitary “Eyes Closed” condition as a comparison. It also included heart rate measurements using chest-strap monitors to evaluate physiological synchrony between participants. Ratings of potential for friendship were added in this version, and romantic attraction was assessed only at the end of the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across both studies, the Just-Like-Me meditation and the gazing condition produced consistent and meaningful effects. In both virtual and in-person settings, participants reported feeling closer to their partners after just two minutes. These increases in closeness were typically about one standard deviation, a large effect for such a brief exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across both studies, participants consistently rated their partners as more attractive following both meditations. Perceptions of warmth also increased, though this effect was limited to the gazing condition in the virtual setting; in person, both meditations led to warmer impressions. In the in-person study, the Just-Like-Me condition also led to higher ratings of the partner’s competence and potential as a friend. When the two meditations were directly compared in this setting, Just-Like-Me outperformed Gazing on measures of closeness and friendship potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also showed increased prosocial behavior after engaging in the dyadic meditations. In both studies, participants allocated more hypothetical money to their partner in the dictator game compared to typical baselines found in previous research. In the in-person study, those who completed the Just-Like-Me meditation gave more than those in the solitary Eyes Closed condition, suggesting a link between interpersonal engagement and generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Potentially, people can experience increased perceptions of attractiveness, which is helpful to be prepared for,” Ludwig said. “It can sometimes feel quite intense to do this exercise with someone. This might be a desirable side effect in dating contexts or romantic partnerships, and it’s usually not overly problematic in other contexts, given this effect is not very strong. I speculate that this happens because we begin to resonate with the other person and perceive their unique ‘beauty,’ so to speak, which increases their perceived attractiveness. The benefits of the exercise likely far outweigh any potential risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers also explored the role of synchrony—subtle coordination in behavior and physiology—as a potential mechanism. In the virtual study, smile synchrony between participants predicted greater closeness, warmth, and even romantic attraction for mixed-gender dyads, but not for same-gender dyads. Dyads in the Just-Like-Me condition showed higher levels of smile synchrony than those in the gazing condition, even though they smiled less overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the in-person study, heart rate synchrony was observed among Just-Like-Me participants and was higher than among pseudo-dyads—pairs who completed the same task separately but were not actual partners. However, unlike smile synchrony, heart rate synchrony did not predict perceived closeness or prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I saw that there was actually smiling synchrony and heart rate synchrony emerging between people doing the Just-Like-Me meditation, I was deeply moved,” Ludwig said. “I had predicted that, of course, but to actually see it was sort of mind-blowing. In terms of the heart rate synchrony, I recommend still some degree of caution interpreting it, because our heart rate measure was very coarse (one measurement every 2 seconds). But something seems to be going on. The synchrony was significantly higher than when I randomly paired participants’ data sets with others in the same condition, which is one gold standard for demonstrating synchrony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a brief moment of mindful, compassionate attention directed toward another person can significantly enhance interpersonal connection, and that synchrony—whether in facial expressions or heart rhythms—may help explain these effects. The results align with a growing body of research showing that emotional and physiological alignment between people is associated with increased trust, empathy, and social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants were strangers, most of them students at UPenn, who were quite new to meditating in general,” Ludwig noted. “I put them in an ‘impossible’ situation, surprising them by asking them to gaze at a stranger in this way (of course, voluntarily). They were not pre-selected based on being interested in wanting to connect in that way. The in-person version (Study 2) was happening just at the end of the pandemic, when everyone was still anxious about social connection. The fact that it worked even in such a group of people and at that difficult time moves me deeply. I truly believe this study can teach us something very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might this actually look like in everyday life? The researchers suggest that anyone—from partners to coworkers—could benefit from practicing the Just-Like-Me meditation. One of the most compelling aspects of the practice was its accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Just-Like-Me meditation is a simple method that can help people (even and especially strangers) connect deeply with each other quickly,” Ludwig told PsyPost. “Our data shows that clearly in terms of self-report and even in terms of smiling synchrony and heart rate synchrony. People could try it with their partner, friends, or work colleagues. It could be used in retreat settings, in educational settings, in organizations, or even in the workplace. Simply have two people look at each other silently and contemplate the sentences that we provided in the study. One could adapt the prompts for different audiences or come up with new ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If direct eye contact is too uncomfortable, it can be enough to sit with each other, looking at the other person’s hair or another area that feels comfortable. The exercise can even be done alone, in one’s imagination or with a photograph (although we didn’t investigate this here, so I can’t make scientific claims on this yet). Sit down, close your eyes, and think of someone specific while contemplating one of the sentences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, look at a photo of the individual,” Ludwig explained. “You could start with someone you already know a bit and like (as people do in ‘loving kindness meditation’). And then make it harder by thinking of someone you truly do not like or have problems with; it could for example be someone with opposing political views, a different group in society that you mistrust, or a person in your life who you are envious of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t mean forgiving everything the other person has done or accepting everything about them. But it does mean opening oneself to shared humanity and perhaps, if that doesn’t seem too strongly put, even a state of unconditional love. This could then open up new avenues for mutual understanding and problem solving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As mentioned, I learned this method from Mironel de Wilde, who learned it from other non-violent communication teachers. I haven’t been able to figure out where exactly it came from, but there are a few books that mention a method similar to it, such as by Dass and Bush. Also the Dalai Lama has mentioned similar ideas, as presented in this study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there were some limitations. The positive outcomes were measured immediately after the interaction, and it remains unclear how long these effects last. The dictator game involved hypothetical money, which may not perfectly reflect real-world behavior. Future studies could benefit from longer sessions, different social contexts, or the use of real incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that dyadic meditations may not be comfortable or appropriate for every setting. While some participants reported feeling more connected, others described the exercise as awkward or emotionally intense. Mixed-gender pairs occasionally reported increased romantic feelings, which might not be welcome in every context, such as the workplace. Participants must be fully informed and allowed to opt out if they feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Potentially there can be increased attractiveness perceptions, which is good to prepare oneself for,” Ludwig said. “It can just be very intense to do this exercise with someone. This might be a desirable side effect in a romantic partnership, however, and not overly problematic in other contexts given this effect is not very strong. I speculate that it’s just that we start to resonate with the other person, perceive their unique “beauty” so to speak, and that increases the perceived attractiveness. Moreover, the benefits likely outweigh the risks very much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the study points to a simple and accessible method for enhancing human connection. The Just-Like-Me meditation requires no special equipment, can be completed in just two minutes, and is effective both in-person and over video. The researchers suggest that it could be used in a wide range of settings. In particular, the lead author is interested in applying the exercise in romantic relationships, to foster intimacy, or in community settings to reduce gang-related violence and political polarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m currently focusing on the study of sexual well-being,” Ludwig said. “Therefore, one direction I’m particularly interested in is applying this exercise in romantic partnerships to explore whether it can strengthen relationships or even enhance physical intimacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve also been in conversation with someone from the law enforcement community, David Berez, who suggested applying this method in restorative justice settings, supporting people who have committed a crime in connecting with their victims in a new way, or possibly even vice versa. While this could be emotionally complex and challenging, I believe it has the potential to be deeply impactful. Similarly, I wonder if it could help young people involved in gang-related violence see one another in a different light. With so many tragic shootings amongst youth occurring in Philadelphia, I wish there were a way for youth to access something like this. I hope that other researchers or community workers might take this idea further and bring it into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finally, I would love to explore the use of this method to foster connection across political divides in the United States,” Ludwig said. “It makes me sad to see how polarized our society has become, and I believe this division is hindering our ability to address the real challenges we face. I understand that many people feel deep anger and resistance to engaging with those on the “other side,” and those emotions are valid. Still, I think it’s worth trying – even a little – to open up space for genuine dialogue. We can disagree on issues and still connect on a human level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope that people give this meditation method a real try! It could be alone, with one’s partner, with friends or in organizations or educational settings! Even if it seems awkward at first, pushing through resistance may pay off in beautiful ways. It’s ok to laugh and giggle when starting out.

Medical studies have shown that this reduces blood volume, and can affect circulation - which, in some people, may make it harder to achieve or keep an erection," Dr Sharma, from &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.medexpress.co.uk/"&gt;MedExpress&lt;/a&gt;, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Excess alcohol consumption can further impact male sexual function in several ways. Firstly, alcohol impairs our central nervous system, which can delay signals between the brain and the penis, causing erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Additionally, alcohol’s diuretic effect causes increased urination, resulting in dehydration and reduced blood flow, including to the penis. This dehydration can also elevate your levels of angiotensin, a hormone associated with ED."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Luckily, dehydration-induced erectile dysfunction has a simple cure, but staying hydrated isn't always as easy as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor's tips for staying hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Dehydration is a big cause of erectile dysfunction (Maskot / Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Sharma has a number of tips for staying healthy and hydrated in the summer months, which as we now know, should help you keep on top of things under the sheets too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;First up, he recommends drinking eight glasses, or two litres of water per day, adding: "For optimal hydration, you should be taking regular sips throughout the day, rather than gulping your water. I would advise those on the move to invest in a bigger refillable bottle, which you can fill at regular points throughout the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Sharma also highlighted the importance of replenishing fluids and any electrolytes which might have been lost as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If you’ve been drinking alcohol or sweating in the sun, your body loses essential electrolytes - like sodium, potassium, and magnesium - which are vital for normal bodily functions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"A quick electrolyte sachet can help restore balance. Alternatively, coconut water or a low-sugar sports drink can also provide a good dose of electrolytes to help you rehydrate effectively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Hydration is key (Romilly Lockyer / Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As much as 20 percent of our daily fluid intake comes from the food we eat, so Dr Sharma recommends eating water-rich foods to keep hydration levels up. But most importantly, you should take stock of how you're feeling and listen to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Consult with your body more regularly. Are you getting headaches? Is your urine not clear during the day? Are you not going to the toilet enough?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"These are all signs that you could be dehydrated and may need to consider a more proactive approach to ingesting more fluids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Other lifestyle factors, such as poor diet, smoking and lack of exercise, are also cited as causes of erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If your symptoms continue even after making lifestyle adaptations, seek advice from your GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:45:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQQnYxQ1JGZ0d2SmlNZUxKdEFOTTlKNVFlTE9KS0ZwYjdyaktlQ3JIbHhhdjYwREY1Z0QxQXZkYUdDdXZRTnMweUhZZkRuOEVROV9FemJUaXoxeVZRTGNqTEpiRm5OcjZZa0RPdXNVbVh4Sk1feW9MUXhwaVY5bHJwWjdWR1JYNk5nTk9lUmhtejAxQzR0VzJDZEgwa1U</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，这种饮食可以显著减少更年期的潮热- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNc0hMMl8wbU1XX1V5OHhRdndRLWZLYXhXeVVXanZRT0xid0Z6Qnk2ay1xVkxIUWxqUTF0QUd1TDROX0VGZDlxTWpJcUJPRW8zUWNKWmRjYkdHMUNpV0pKUGo2SFc3emtwYzNvNUFKSHdvZ2JDRGxkUElZUjkyRGNndWZjTVc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plant-based diets are often &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/5-benefits-of-a-plant-based-diet.h20-1592991.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="recommended by health experts" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688cb4c6e4b05680e80c2e3b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/5-benefits-of-a-plant-based-diet.h20-1592991.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommended by health experts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for reducing cancer and heart disease risks, helping maintain a healthy weight and improving overall health.

While the study is small, after 12 weeks, the vegan eaters’ severe hot flashes decreased by 92%, and they lost about 8 pounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if you’re in perimenopause or menopause, does that mean you should go vegan?

While a plant-based approach can help balance hormones, weight and menopausal symptoms, you don’t necessarily have to give up all animal products, she added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11007410/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688cb4c6e4b05680e80c2e3b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11007410/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; has also shown that the Mediterranean diet, which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-practical-guide-to-the-mediterranean-diet-2019032116194" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="includes some fish, poultry and dairy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688cb4c6e4b05680e80c2e3b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-practical-guide-to-the-mediterranean-diet-2019032116194" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;includes some fish, poultry and dairy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and lots of fruits and vegetables, is beneficial for women during menopause, as well as cardiovascular health and overall well-being, Wilson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Because it promotes heart health, I do think it would be beneficial for menopausal women to follow this diet, as well,” Wilson said. “Any diet plan rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein and low in carbohydrates and refined sugars would be ideal for menopausal women.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any downsides to plant-based diets? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It is possible to eat a balanced diet with only vegan foods, but it can be more challenging to get everything your body needs,” Haas said. So, pay attention to your diet to make sure you’re getting enough essential nutrients. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, vitamin B12 is more abundant in animal foods, so you may need to supplement this nutrient, she said. Calcium, zinc, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may also be harder to get on a vegan diet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting enough protein is another issue, Wilson said. “With muscle mass declining in menopause, it is important to have enough protein and appropriate exercise to help maintain that muscle.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Going vegan can also be too restrictive for some people and sometimes difficult to follow, Ward said. Fresh produce may not be accessible in some communities, Haas added; however, the new research suggests people may still benefit from processed plant-based foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to embrace a plant-based diet during menopause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to eat more plant-based, Wilson suggested doing so gradually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You can easily add more fruits and vegetables to each meal of your day,” she said. “Then you can gradually change meat protein to plant-based protein.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, replacing dairy with oat or soy milk, swapping meat for beans one meal a day, and filling half your plate with veggies are small steps to take, Light said. Shortcuts, such as frozen vegetables, canned beans and ready-to-eat grains, can make it a little easier to stick to, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains — the go-tos of a plant-based diet — are high in fiber, which she said helps keep you full. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plant-based diets are also typically lower in calories and fat, which can promote a healthy weight. “Weight gain is a common menopause concern, and a plant-based diet has been shown to reduce body weight and has other metabolic benefits,” Haas said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There isn’t necessarily a one-size-fits-all diet for menopausal women, though, Light said.

So, pay attention to your diet to make sure you’re getting enough essential nutrients. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, vitamin B12 is more abundant in animal foods, so you may need to supplement this nutrient, she said. Calcium, zinc, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may also be harder to get on a vegan diet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting enough protein is another issue, Wilson said. “With muscle mass declining in menopause, it is important to have enough protein and appropriate exercise to help maintain that muscle.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Going vegan can also be too restrictive for some people and sometimes difficult to follow, Ward said. Fresh produce may not be accessible in some communities, Haas added; however, the new research suggests people may still benefit from processed plant-based foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to embrace a plant-based diet during menopause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to eat more plant-based, Wilson suggested doing so gradually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You can easily add more fruits and vegetables to each meal of your day,” she said. “Then you can gradually change meat protein to plant-based protein.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, replacing dairy with oat or soy milk, swapping meat for beans one meal a day, and filling half your plate with veggies are small steps to take, Light said.

Store it in a 92-gram foil pouch, so it can be easily sucked by starving infants on the front line. No water or refrigeration is required, meaning it can be distributed in drought-hit areas and stored at ambient temperature for up to two years. Just a couple of daily sachets can lead to a 10 percent weight gain over six weeks, sustaining recovery from severe acute malnutrition for less than $60 per child. Saving a life, it turns out, literally costs peanuts: just 71 cents a serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This life-saving mixture is &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nutriset.fr/en/products/plumpynut-en/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nutriset.fr/en/products/plumpynut-en/"}' href="https://nutriset.fr/en/products/plumpynut-en/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Plumpy’Nut&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by Normandy-based manufacturer Nutriset in 1996 by French paediatrician André Briend, it was the first &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usaid-rutf-state-department-supplies-warehouses/"&gt;ready-to-use therapeutic food&lt;/a&gt; (RUTF): energy-dense pastes that have boosted survival rates of severe acute malnutrition in children from less than 25 per cent to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/04/25/g-s1-62165/malnutrition-children-plumpynut-lifesaving-u-s-aid"&gt;around 90 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The paste has saved tens of millions of lives. “It’s incredibly effective emergency food,” says medical doctor Steve Collins, founder of advocacy group Valid Nutrition. “RUTF contains all the essential nutrients required for someone to recover from severe acute malnutrition. They’re easy to transport, extremely energy dense, and don’t require a cold supply chain or clean water to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While Nutriset's product was the first RUTF to be developed, it is not the only brand in this important field. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://mananutrition.org/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://mananutrition.org/"}' href="https://mananutrition.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is an American-made RUTF produced in Fitzgerald, Georgia. The company states it can make 500,000 pounds of product per day—enough to fill four shipping containers, and feed 10 million children per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Before Plumpy’Nut, cases of severe acute malnutrition—primarily occurring among children under 5 years old, diagnosed by very low weight-for-height scores and arm circumference—needed round-the-clock care at therapeutic feeding centres. Nurses at these makeshift hospitals in often remote areas would feed infants F100, a high-energy milk powder also made by Nutriset. Bacteria was often rife. “There was always a risk that water was contaminated and carried disease,” says Collins. It's one of the reasons why mortality rates for in-patient care lurked at &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6793843/#:~:text=below%20WHO%20estimates%20(10%25%E2%80%9320%25)"&gt;around 20 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Over half of Plumpy’Nut is made from peanut paste and vegetable oils. The nutty primary base contains fat-soluble nutrients, as well as protein, energy, and fatty acids that spark recovery. Nearly a quarter is skimmed milk powder, containing dairy protein and essential amino acids, the building blocks of protein. Another quarter is reserved for sugar—masking the taste of the added micronutrients: potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, iodine, copper, selenium, and vitamins A, D, E, B complex, C, and K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The apocryphal story is that Briend’s idea for the marvel that is Plumpy’Nut came from a jar of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/snackfishing-fake-viral-food-clear-ketchup/"&gt;Nutella&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, it came from firsthand experience on the front line in the Sahel: The water-based solution wasn’t working—infants were still dying. Working with Nutriset founder Michel Lescanne, his idea was to add F100 to a spread of peanuts (a common crop in areas of malnutrition and a natural protein-rich source) with oil and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxQYlIyQmZFeTlKcG5IYzFyN2FrbHRuaDhnYURVUWNWR0Vsdzc5VS16emZqdktfZnMyd09pVVVITG8tOGl4bHJFN2l2TE81UDl5SDdydzNQM3FrLWcydXBqVXQtQzFqaWhqTFBUWEJVenF1Wng3czQ1ZE54aGI4MDRyMzk3NUVsdFFHc2RiTC1kZXVwZmRJRkxjYXlvNTYtWlhVNjJ3VVVCZmkydzFWb0dERncxOGk</guid></item><item><title>为什么你对抹茶的痴迷可能会扰乱你的铁水平-独立报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPNDhkN0M3MklnemEwMElCdkRELTZiMU00TjhPOWphQzNCT2F5SG1OWHFlUzFoYmNrcmdwclc2bS04T2FKR2RKN1pWLXlkTHA1NFMzUURMcFplQllIS1VsTlcyel83U0pXV2lmOWZHNnlxM25hLTJFR0Q1WVVRb3JVMWFSb2c1d3BIRjVPempPSDE5cVUxclA3b1ZaQW16dnBQYmtv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Not only is its &lt;a href="/asia/japan/matcha-shortage-japan-global-supply-heatwave-b2797101.html"&gt;popularity drying up global supplies&lt;/a&gt;, but drinking too much of it could contribute to an &lt;a href="/topic/iron"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; deficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/nutritionists"&gt;Nutritionists&lt;/a&gt; warn the green lattes can affect &lt;a href="/topic/iron"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; absorption and &lt;a href="/topic/vegetarians"&gt;vegetarians&lt;/a&gt; are at a higher risk than meat eaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matcha is made from the green &lt;a href="/topic/tea"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; plant, Camellia Sinensis, which is ground into a powder. Because it’s grown in the shade the plant produces more chlorophyll, which not only gives it a deep green colour but also means it contains more nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Hobson, a nutritionist and author of &lt;em&gt;Unprocess Your Family Life&lt;/em&gt;, explains the drink does have health benefits. “It contains polyphenols which protects the body against oxidative damage. So, it helps to reduce &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; which then helps to protect against chronic diseases,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 jzbPdB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/26/15/34/iStock-2199126862.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/26/15/34/iStock-2199126862.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/26/15/34/iStock-2199126862.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Drinking too much matcha could contribute to an iron deficiency, nutritionists warn" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-316313"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Drinking too much matcha could contribute to an iron deficiency, nutritionists warn&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because it contains &lt;a href="/topic/caffeine"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; it helps with mental focus. But it also contains L-theanine which helps to lessen that jittery edge that you get from caffeine,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also suggested these polyphenols in matcha can reduce the risk of heart disease. But the same health boosting polyphenols also make it harder for the body to absorb iron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunter Kuhnle, a professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading explained matcha &lt;a href="/topic/tea"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; can affect iron absorption by binding the (non-haem) iron that is found in many plant foods – such as lentils, leafy greens and tofu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It contains the compounds catechins and tannins – which are both polyphenols – that can bind to iron in the digestive tracts, and this stops them from being taken up by the body,” Professor Kuhnle told the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cnxcc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/24/11/56/iStock-2179940383.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/24/11/56/iStock-2179940383.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/24/11/56/iStock-2179940383.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The same health boosting polyphenols that make it good for your heart also make it harder for the body to absorb iron" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-316314"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The same health boosting polyphenols that make it good for your heart also make it harder for the body to absorb iron&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These complexes then pass through the gut and are not useful for the body – this can reduce iron uptake by up to 50 per cent, but this varies a lot between individuals and depends on the timing of the meal and the type of food,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained there is a similar problem with green tea because it also contains high levels of polyphenols. Although rare, in one instance a 48-year-old man became anaemic from excessive green tea consumption Professor Kuhnle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Hobson stressed that you don’t need to worry if you have a balanced diet, but warned &lt;a href="/topic/vegetarians"&gt;vegetarians&lt;/a&gt; are at a greater risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because it only affects non-haem iron which is in tofu and lentils and not haem iron which is found in meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are vegan or vegetarian and you are relying on lentils, leafy green and tofu for your iron, then you might want to avoid drinking matcha with your meals because it can inhibit iron absorption in the gut,” Mr Hobson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also stressed that if you are low in iron anyway and take iron supplements, you should avoid taking these at the same time as drinking a matcha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An iron deficiency, also called anaemia, can cause tiredness, shortness of breath, paler skin, headaches and heart palpitations, according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low iron is common among &lt;a href="/topic/teenage-girls"&gt;teenage girls&lt;/a&gt;, vegans and vegetarians with a study by Lund University in Sweden finding 38 per cent of participants who were &lt;a href="/topic/teenage-girls"&gt;teenage girls&lt;/a&gt; and 70 per cent of participants who were vegetarian or vegan, affected by the deficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to reap the health benefits of matcha, in addition to not drinking it at mealtimes, make sure to avoid adding a lot of syrup or cream. Mr Hobson instead suggests the healthiest option is to drink it plain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 10:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPNDhkN0M3MklnemEwMElCdkRELTZiMU00TjhPOWphQzNCT2F5SG1OWHFlUzFoYmNrcmdwclc2bS04T2FKR2RKN1pWLXlkTHA1NFMzUURMcFplQllIS1VsTlcyel83U0pXV2lmOWZHNnlxM25hLTJFR0Q1WVVRb3JVMWFSb2c1d3BIRjVPempPSDE5cVUxclA3b1ZaQW16dnBQYmtv</guid></item><item><title>您什么时候知道什么时候停止癌症治疗？她知道--她最后的控制--《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPZ0x2dnJGNUNETjZxY3otMWJLVzNLaXI5eE0zc2Z3NU1DQUJ6cXEwcGlBZTJyRGJiZmpBOWw2RV9YNG1SUEU4MFh2NUQzODBCVlRURGFybS1ZSjJ4aFk4WEN1VnFRWEtHQjJoX2cwVzJwb0x2Vy1CX3ZBWmFKRVNXeVBmRWVXQjhZbnBRcGg2YUFRMzhE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector content__main-column--interactive dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;figure id="e2f17894-7304-41bd-a79c-f11a1d3c82d5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.InteractiveAtomBlockElement" class="element element-atom dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figure class="interactive interactive-atom dcr-e6xisx" data-atom-id="interactives/2023/01/interactive-article-structure/portrait-image-mainmedia-feature" data-atom-type="interactive-layout"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="10876d41-3dd4-48ca-a498-5bfe18efa699" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Betsy Lewis, 75, poses for a portrait at her home in Houston, Texas.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Interactive","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/interactive","type":"Type","title":"Interactive"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-narrative--commissioning-","type":"Tracking","title":"US Narrative (Commissioning)"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-visuals","type":"Tracking","title":"US Visuals"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/ng-interactive/2025/aug/04/stop-cancer-treatment-essay","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I can remember many things about the afternoon I told Betsy that she had stage IV lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I can still see how the single ray of sunshine from the skylight in the atrium behind us entered the crack between the curtains in her hospital room, shooting right through the crystalline IV bag hanging from the pole next to her, turning it into a depressing sort of disco ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I can still hear the sardonic laugh we shared about the unwieldy chest tube emerging from between her ribs that was slowly re-inflating her lung after a biopsy had caused it to partially collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, as her oncologist, what I remember most clearly was her outward equanimity about it all. She was 72 years old, divorced, fierce and sarcastic. She’d later tell me how caring for her mother as she’d slowly declined with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had put her “firmly in the quality over quantity camp”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="569095b1-937f-4148-b5ef-0cd06ab97ca9" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Betsy Lewis.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She had already been treated for breast cancer, having gone through surgery, radiation and hormonal therapies some years before. She knew very well the promises and limitations of modern oncology, and that each path had its costs. Hard-earned experience meant she harbored few illusions about any of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I went over the PET scan she’d had prior to her admission to the hospital. Masses in both lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We know what that means,” she said, pursing her lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My job was to provide information, I thought then. Her job would be deciding what we did with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Well, yes, I don’t think we’re looking at something that’s curable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Betsy would later tell me that while she wouldn’t call herself a control freak, she felt driven by a deep need to remain in control of her own circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We would spend the next two years figuring out what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Two weeks later, we went over the biopsy results in my outpatient office. The pathologist had finalized a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma; subsequent testing had shown that her tumor harbored a significant level of PDL1 expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“And what does that mean?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It means it would be reasonable to treat you with immunotherapy alone”, I said, explaining that we could use a drug called pembrolizumab to better allow her own immune system to find and kill the cancer cells inside of her body. “We don’t have to start with any chemotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Good, because I’m never going to do any chemotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I nodded, though I’d heard these declarations before from dozens of other patients. But when the scans showed progression, and the progression was causing pain, and the prospect of one’s death loomed ever closer, red lines drawn in the light of better health suddenly didn’t seem so final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sure, we can talk about that when we get there.” I instinctively recoiled from challenging my patients’ values. This was what it meant to give our patients autonomy, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;]She didn’t say anything, but the look in her eyes told me what I needed to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I’d later asked how her previous experience getting treated for breast cancer informed her approach to this new diagnosis, how she’d come into it with a rare clarity on what she would and would not accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The only negative that stuck with me from breast cancer was never to get married again, because my husband was not supportive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You know, people say, ‘Oh, they fought and fought and fought,’ and I don’t know that I agree with that. I don’t ever want to be kept alive. I don’t ever want my life to be one day of suffering and fighting after another. I don’t want that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="af8799f1-0856-4c48-8315-39ebeb785cc9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Betsy Lewis.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I could appreciate that. I agreed it wasn’t true that the only sane response to lived experience was more of it. But I also thought chemotherapy occupied an unfair place in the popular imagination. Sometimes, the pain, weight loss and weakness that patients and families blamed on paclitaxel or oxaliplatin were just as much caused by the cancer itself. And often, in the grieving imagination of those left behind, a death from cancer gradually became a death from the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, there was no denying the toll taken by the indefinite treatments we recommended to patients with incurable cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My next door neighbor was about 10 years younger than I am and she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the same time, my uncle by marriage was diagnosed with a glioblastoma. I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was like, ‘Don’t drink the water where we are, you know?’”. She paused until I got the joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I watched both of them, my uncle and my dear friend go from treatment to treatment to treatment. Never, quote, “giving up” and being pushed by their families to continue treatment. And I thought it was very inhumane. If you’re going to extend somebody’s life by a week and a half or six months, and those six months are going to be hell, I’m not going to sign up for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A 2016 study had led to pembrolizumab’s approval for a subset of people with advanced lung cancer. Nearly half of the patients in the trial responded to that drug alone without the use of chemotherapy. And, in a disease where survival is often measured in months, nearly a third were still alive five years later. On average, the patients in the trial lived about two years – a meaningful gain for those who might live only a few months without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I talked about this data with Betsy and her family before she eventually agreed to undergo therapy. She later told me she appreciated that I’d been honest and open about the numbers, that she’d had a good idea from the beginning of how long the treatment would be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Growing up, Betsy’s family called her Big Momma - “and it wasn’t a compliment…it was basically implied that I was bossy or needed to have things done my way”. That baseline need was further sharpened by her mother’s exacting standards and the subsequent responsibilities she took on caring for her brother, who suffered from severe mental illness. It further solidified, years later, when she had to find ways to make ends meet as a single mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an important way, her fastidiousness was rooted in the knowledge that so much depended on her doing things right the first time. As the decades passed, friends and family learned she could be counted on to help them navigate complicated medical decisions like choosing a nursing home or arranging a home health aide. Now, she’d draw on that energy to get through her own cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="28fc6818-f1f8-476f-93fd-985761ba1b35" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Lewis says family and friends have been an instrumental source of support.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over her first few months on pembrolizumab, her chest and back were slowly covered with a fine red rash that itched like hell – a condition called immune dermatitis, which resulted from the same T-cells that were being activated to fight the patient’s cancer mistakenly targeting their skin. The itching went from a mild annoyance to an around-the-clock obsession that made sleep impossible. Betsy herself described her years-long experience with it as “almost torture”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We recommended plastic jars full of steroid creams, metal tubes of steroid ointments and soothing lotions of varying potency. We also tried an assortment of antihistamines without much success. Poring over case reports online, I found some data to support the prescription of gabapentin – a medication typically used to treat diabetic neuropathy – for her itching. That helped a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She was also getting more and more fatigued. She still worked from home part-time, but she’d finish for the day and collapse on her couch, sleeping for hours at a time. We checked her thyroid and cortisol levels, both of which are commonly affected by immunotherapy. Both normal. We checked her blood counts. Nearly normal. I couldn’t find anything to fix. We were prisoners of the measurable. I was left recommending her to sleep as much as she could and do only as much as her body allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet despite all of the negatives, the treatment was also clearly working to control her cancer’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I can recall the feeling of anxious anticipation when I got the message that the results of her first scan were ready. It echoed what I’d felt in high school when I’d gotten a large envelope in the mail from a college I’d applied to – a fragile expectation that contained within it an implicit admonition not to get my hopes up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I took a deep breath and clicked on the result. Her cancer was shrinking. The response continued at six months out. It continued at 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was difficult to live like that, from scan to scan. Not many are equipped to handle that kind of sustained uncertainty. Betsy seemed to be doing well enough with it, though. At least that’s what she let me see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We felt it was worth it to continue. For now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I am very good at weighing pluses and minuses,” she told me, “but my pluses and minuses can be very different than someone else’s.” I wondered how long this new equilibrium could last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the first two years after we diagnosed Betsy’s cancer, I wrote 33 progress notes in her chart. That meant I saw her 33 times, an average of aboutp once every three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We developed a strange kind of intimacy. I didn’t know where she grew up, what her house looked like, what her favorite movie was. Yet, I’d seen into her lungs. I knew why she couldn’t sleep. I had data that told me how long she might live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I was witnessing her facing death. I knew in a very real way what she was about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That vulnerability went only one way, however. Though Betsy and my other patients got to know me, I was able to hide behind the dry-cleaned fabric of my white coat and the emotional remove of my role as doctor. That was how I had been taught to be. My patients didn’t need to know about my hangovers, my heartbreaks. They didn’t need to know, I told myself, what treatments I’d recommend to my own family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet I still think Betsy learned enough about what I was about to stick around. I wasn’t as hidden as I thought. There were plenty of oncologists in our city. For a patient to stay with me was a choice, the implications of which I never took lightly. Our relationship was about more than five year overall survival numbers and maintaining adequate kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To be the doctor she needed, I knew I’d have to find a way to keep giving her more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the spring following Betsy’s diagnosis, she was admitted to the hospital with bacterial pneumonia. The cough lingered for weeks, though she eventually recovered enough to make a trip to Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A few months later, she suffered a viral upper respiratory tract infection that was soon complicated by another bacterial pneumonia. Her scans became more difficult to interpret, the smoothly outlined opacities of her cancer now superimposed with the ground glass caused by repeated infections. PET-CT scans showed more metabolic activity in the lungs as well, but it wasn’t clear whether this was a sign of growing cancer cells or an immune system struggling to fight off multiple infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We spent long visits talking about the implications of those hard-to-parse scans, poring over measurements of size, of metabolic activity. I tried to provide reasonable explanations for any increases, explanations that didn’t involve a growing resistance to the therapy that had been so successful for over a year. I wanted to take what I knew about her case to tell a story that was reassuring. I couldn’t adhere any longer to some imagined ideal of impartiality at odds with what I understood it meant to care for another person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I remember one such visit particularly well, a little over a year into therapy. The scan we’d done before the appointment showed new findings in both breasts. This was not an area that lung cancer was known for going, I told her. We couldn’t explain this away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0d1babf0-f5dd-4b11-bbb0-f56d2c9a1996" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Lewis holds a Star of David necklace with a diamond that belonged to her paternal grandmother.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She was unmoved. “I’ve had that right breast biopsied a few times since I was treated for the breast cancer way back when.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Still, I’d like you to go see the breast surgeon. Get it checked out. There’s a small spot on the PET scan in the left breast too, even though we can’t feel anything there.” She went under protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A few weeks later, after talking Betsy into another biopsy, the surgeon called me. It was a small cancer on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My colleagues and I discussed her case with all the relevant specialists, and we shared our recommendations with her. She didn’t want to have surgery and she didn’t want to risk an anti-estrogen medication. What was the point of being aggressive with treating the breast cancer at all, she wondered, given that it was more likely that lung cancer would threaten her life first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even the medicine sounded like too much. She’d taken it for five years following her first breast cancer diagnosis nearly a decade ago, and it had made her so tired. The pembrolizumab was making her tired enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We agreed – we would watch it. We’d act not to control the cancer, but to control what we would and would not do about it. The decision had emerged from Betsy’s own history with breast cancer and its treatments. She knew in a very real way what each option would cost her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“So what’s going on with my lung cancer, anyway?” Even a change of subject couldn’t get us any real relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One scan pointed to it looking worse, another better. I squinted at the pixels on the screen. Maybe if I looked hard enough, I thought, I could see what was going on inside of those inscrutable cells. It was like staring into the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’d have to say things are relatively stable. We’ve been seeing small changes in both ways over the last year. Nothing conclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An exhale. A shift in gravity and light. “I don’t know how long I can keep doing this.” Bone-deep exhaustion. The rash and itching that kept her up at night. Nothing I’d tried had worked. She kept refusing oral steroids — the big gun — because prednisone spiked her anxiety and wrecked what little sleep she got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I could see what was coming. And while I could no longer confine myself to a dry recounting of the facts, I didn’t know what else I could say to change Betsy’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What did it mean to fight? Wasn’t it more important to ask what we were fighting for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;August in Houston. A hot, hot afternoon. The humid air so heavy it could be cut into blocks and stored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That day, nearly two years into her treatment, Betsy told me she couldn’t work any longer, couldn’t do anything after noon but nap and lie on her couch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I think about that appointment now, nearly a year later, it seems delusional that I tried so desperately to convince her to change her mind after she went on to tell me she didn’t want any more infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But I was motivated, I think, by a need to move beyond a dispassionate recitation of facts and options. I wanted to help her make a choice that was consistent with what mattered most to her, especially if it wasn’t obvious at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was a transition that Drs Linda and Ezekiel Emanuel had written about in a landmark 1992 examination of the doctor-patient relationship they’d published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, describing how clinicians might move from a purely informative mode to what they termed a deliberative one. But I didn’t know any of that then. I just wanted her to leave my clinic without any regrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So I tried to talk her out of her decision. She wasn’t in the hospital, after all. She’d just traveled across the country for her step-daughter’s wedding. She was living alone and independently in her own home. Her last scans showed that the cancer wasn’t growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The patients in the trial had each received three years of Keytruda, and she’d be stopping short of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Would she take a break from treatment and restart in a few months when she was feeling better, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Would she take a break and consider chemotherapy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Also no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her daughter Lindsey later told me that she had made the decision to stop therapy with the firm expectation that the end of her life would soon follow. She’d lived with a sense of fatalism since her breast cancer diagnosis; both of her parents hadn’t made it to their 80s. She’d helped so many navigate their final weeks and months, and the knowledge of death’s inevitability was never far from her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her sister Leslie shared with me that she also had a sense that the treatment had bought her enough time to get her affairs in order. Now that she knew she’d done all she could to make sure her children would be taken care of financially, she felt she could let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When, against her expectations, she made it to fall, she planned for Thanksgiving to be her grand goodbye. Family from across the country flew to Houston to be with her, and everything was arranged just so. But then she made it to Hanukkah, then New Year’s. She continued to feel well enough; she was still working; the scans showed no growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8d012e3b-b9d8-4d17-9f9c-bdb4f67f94bc" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Lewis, right, talks with a friend at her home in Houston, Texas.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lindsey tried to remind her mother about how the data showed that a small fraction of patients had made it to five years with something like the therapy she’d gotten. “She goes back and forth between being very fatalistic, like where I’m dying imminently… to ‘I’m not that bad, back off, you’re not my mother’”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She’d crested the hill, taken her hands off the handlebars, entrusted herself to what fate had in store. Her final act of control was to relinquish it. Maybe she thought it was the choice that would best ensure the kind of death she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But when February rolled around and she was still going strong, Lindsey had to finally ask, “OK, we need to start talking about your birthday. We’re running out of time. Do you want this party or not?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On an unseasonably cool May afternoon, I joined Betsy’s family and friends to celebrate her 75th birthday in her backyard, where we shared memories over lemonade and fajitas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When we’d stopped the pembrolizumab nine months before, none of us had known if this celebration was in the cards. Now, we sat together, watching the sun set over the neatly manicured flower beds and the precisely arranged folding tables. Drinks were arrayed on the side-board in the dining room, and trays of tortillas lay ready in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Being on the treatment had made this perfect night possible. Coming off the treatment also had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I’d told her I wanted to write about her story, Betsy said that she supported the idea. She wanted her family to understand why she’d made the choice that she had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I asked her how her relationships with those closest to her had changed in the months since she’d stopped therapy. “Well, everybody is making their pilgrimages. You don’t have to lift a finger, or you can just sit in your house and people can come, and then when it’s time for them to go, they can go home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, for now, it wasn’t time to go home yet, not for another few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When faced with serious illness, I think we all want to reach that state of balance in which we neither welcome death nor push it away. Betsy had come closer to that equilibrium than most, and she’d done that by being true to herself. As much as she still expected the end of her life was near, that didn’t mean she wouldn’t celebrate it while she still could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a1b547ae-c826-4659-82aa-e81ae10afdab" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Lewis gently admires a plant in her home.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The cake was brought out of the kitchen, and as we sang, circled around, I read the inscription in icing - “Happy Birthday, Bestsy” it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her sister said the misspelling had been intentional.

His approach focuses on “flattening the carbohydrate curve” and building insulin sensitivity, combining science-backed strategies with practical food planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes control starts with a consistent diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernando emphasized that one of the biggest mistakes diabetic patients make is inconsistency in their diet. “You can’t have dosa one day, fried rice the next, and think insulin can keep up,” he explained. Instead, he recommends a “carbohydrate flatline,” where each meal, especially breakfast, includes a consistent amount of carbs, ideally around 60 grams. This steady intake helps avoid insulin spikes and keeps blood sugar levels stable throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strength training for insulin sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond diet, Fernando stresses the importance of resistance training in reversing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike cardio alone, strength training improves muscle mass, which in turn enhances insulin sensitivity. “The more lean muscle you have, the more glucose your body can absorb efficiently,” he noted. Fernando encourages a weekly workout routine that includes weight lifting or bodyweight exercises tailored to the individual’s capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Personal experience adds credibility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernando’s own father, a diabetic patient for years, assumed medication meant he could return to old eating habits. “That’s a dangerous mindset,” said Fernando. Through a structured nutrition plan and consistent workouts, his father reduced his blood sugar levels significantly without relying solely on medication. This real-life example adds weight to his philosophy of managing diabetes through lifestyle, not just pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remission vs. reversal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Fernando’s approach has gained traction, experts caution that the term “reversal” can be misleading. Many medical professionals argue that while remission is possible for early-stage type 2 diabetes, long-term insulin users may not be able to reverse the disease entirely. The effectiveness of lifestyle changes often depends on the type, stage, and duration of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway: Individualized, sustainable change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernando’s message resonates in a world where metabolic disorders are rising at alarming rates. His “food-first” strategy, rooted in consistency, strength training, and patient education, offers a hopeful path forward, especially for early-stage diabetics. However, experts agree: any such plan must be tailored to the individual and supported by clinical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>3种饮食可能有助于降低糖尿病风险：它们有什么共同点？ -今日医学新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxPcFNLUUd0a1UyWFVKUGtTaEM5UWNXNldwMmFWc0k5NS1BYmJVejhKSnhhZGxqWHUtOXEzbjIzSER2WUo3MGlUelZkSWNmaGxXcldNdHFPdGZGVm9PTWI5UkdKTjRWRU0xdEhXNXNGTTY0eGw2Q3pOU0VFMGItOGJDVHg2b1M2WUl1a1BtbTQtRDJZXzAxdVgxOTBLMXFlX0J0b3Vfb1ZVcTlRS0JucGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/woman-vegtable-shopping-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/woman-vegtable-shopping-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/woman-vegtable-shopping-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/woman-vegtable-shopping-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="woman picking tomatoes at the market" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fmediterranean-dash-or-ahei-which-diet-lowers-diabetes-risk-the-most&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F08%2Fwoman-vegtable-shopping-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=3%20diets%20may%20help%20lower%20diabetes%20risk%3A%20What%20do%20they%20have%20in%20common%3F" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/woman-vegtable-shopping-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;What type of diet is linked to the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes?

This is noteworthy because these groups have different food cultures and different levels of diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the analysis is that the decrease in risk, though apparent, did not reach a level of statistical significance for Hispanic people or mixed ethnic groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that this may be due to having less data for these populations in the original studies. They say further investigation, particularly for these populations, is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best-known of the three diets cited in the meta-analysis is the Mediterranean diet. This diet is based on the eating patterns practiced by long-lived people living in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is characterized by an emphasis on unprocessed foods, fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and lean sources of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DASH diet, as its full name — Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension — suggests, helps a person reduce their intake of sodium and to increase their consumption of magnesium, calcium, and potassium to help maintain a healthy blood pressure. It is in many ways not very different from the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the least familiar diet mentioned in the metastudy is Harvard University’s AHEI diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at Entirely Nourished, not involved in this research, explained what the AHEI diet is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The AHEI (Alternative Healthy Eating Index) diet is a research-based scoring system developed to assess diet quality based on how well it aligns with dietary patterns that have been shown to lower chronic disease risk. It encourages high consumption of fiber-dense foods like vegetables, whole fruits excluding juice, whole grains, nuts, legumes; healthy fats like polyunsaturated fats, and lean proteins, specifically fish and poultry. It limits red and processed meats, refined grains, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three diets share some underlying concepts, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/faculty_info.aspx/Ng5639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jason Ng&lt;/a&gt;, MD, BA, who teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They all, “contain the common theme of focusing on healthy fats, more plant-based foods like vegetables and fruits, and staying away from processed foods and keeping away from high sugar and added sugars to foods, which are all cornerstones of type 2 diabetes management,” said Ng, who was likewise not involved in this research.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foods people consume are a major driver of diabetes, said Ng. “Type 2 diabetes is caused by increasing insulin resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Carbohydrates,” he explained, “especially processed sugars, for example, lead to extra work for the body to process. Over time, potential &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/305567" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; increases, which forces the pancreas to make more insulin to compensate. When the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to manage blood sugars, you develop [type 2 diabetes].”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein noted that some popular foods are particularly likely to cause this to occur, citing sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains such as white bread and pastries, processed and red meats, and fried and fast foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she said, “diets high in added sugars and sodium but low in fiber-rich whole foods significantly increase diabetes risk by promoting inflammation, impairing insulin sensitivity, contributing to weight gain, and disrupting gut health, all of which play a role in poor glucose regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DASH diet has a slightly higher emphasis on sodium intake that may indirectly worsen insulin resistance,” Ng hypothesized, “so an emphasis on low sodium may indirectly help insulin sensitivity and, thus, improve [type 2 diabetes].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routhenstein was drawn to another aspect of the DASH diet, pointing out that it “has the unique offering of honing into certain micronutrients.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example,” she explained, “[the DASH diet] is abundant in both potassium and magnesium that not only supports healthy blood pressure but also plays a key role in glucose metabolism, enhancing insulin sensitivity, facilitating cellular glucose uptake, and reducing systemic inflammation, creating a metabolic environment less prone to diabetes development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 06:45:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPcFNLUUd0a1UyWFVKUGtTaEM5UWNXNldwMmFWc0k5NS1BYmJVejhKSnhhZGxqWHUtOXEzbjIzSER2WUo3MGlUelZkSWNmaGxXcldNdHFPdGZGVm9PTWI5UkdKTjRWRU0xdEhXNXNGTTY0eGw2Q3pOU0VFMGItOGJDVHg2b1M2WUl1a1BtbTQtRDJZXzAxdVgxOTBLMXFlX0J0b3Vfb1ZVcTlRS0JucGc</guid></item><item><title>心血管疾病的死亡率急剧下降—这背后的突破是什么？ -我们的数据世界</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE50SWM3Wk1Gb25nSzh0djJsamVrcnhyQWVxRm9ab3JYazRnWTQxQkdKWjkwWVVXMDBZLWE1SlFjQnBpbDdyaDBKM3NwNWdTSVl2SXAtSWVjazc1cTZ3LXhHcG9RbVlJdlU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="centered-article-container grid grid-cols-12-full-width centered-article-container--article"&gt;&lt;p class="centered-article-header__banner"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;header class="centered-article-header align-center grid grid-cols-8 span-cols-8 col-start-4 grid-md-cols-6 span-md-cols-12 col-md-start-2"&gt;&lt;p class="centered-article-header__title-container col-start-2 span-cols-6 span-md-cols-6 col-md-start-1"&gt;&lt;h1 class="centered-article-header__title"&gt;Death rates from cardiovascular disease have fallen dramatically — what were the breakthroughs behind this?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="centered-article-header__subtitle col-start-2 span-cols-6 span-md-cols-6 col-md-start-1"&gt;Over a century of progress in surgery, drugs, prevention, and emergency response has driven down death rates from heart disease and stroke.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For much of history, heart disease was a mystery. Middle-aged adults often collapsed without warning, and doctors usually blamed “dropsy”, “apoplexy”, or simply “old age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-1" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1945 — at just 63 years old — President Franklin D. Roosevelt was sitting for a portrait when he raised a hand to his head and whispered, “I have a terrific pain in the back of my head.” Minutes later, he lost consciousness and died from a massive brain hemorrhage — a consequence of uncontrolled high blood pressure and heart disease, which doctors at the time couldn’t treat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-2" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roosevelt wasn’t alone. Mid-twentieth-century medicine, even for some of the world's most powerful people, often lacked the tools to treat or sometimes even diagnose specific cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was no routine blood pressure screening. There were only basic diagnostic tools — no &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="ct-imaging" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="mri-imaging" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="echocardiography" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;echocardiography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to spot clots or artery damage. Even if someone was diagnosed, few effective medicines or surgeries were available to treat them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-3" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, pills could have driven down Roosevelt’s blood pressure within weeks. The hypertension that struck him and many others without warning, often known as “the silent killer”, is routinely diagnosed and treated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cardiovascular diseases — the broad term for conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels — are still the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; worldwide. But the story reflects a remarkable and often overlooked fact: the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases has fallen dramatically in recent decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the United States alone, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="age_standardized" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;age-standardized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; death rate from cardiovascular disease has fallen by three-quarters since 1950. This means that for people of the same age, the annual risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is now just one-quarter what it was in 1950.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This progress was built on decades of biomedical research, surgical advances, public health efforts, and lifestyle changes, which means that far fewer people die from sudden strokes or heart attacks. If they do, it happens much later, after they’ve lived longer and healthier lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this article, I’ll look at how and why deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined. I’ll focus on data from the United States, but as we’ll see, many other countries have followed a similar path.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="cardiovascular-mortality-rates-have-declined-greatly"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cardiovascular mortality rates have declined greatly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#cardiovascular-mortality-rates-have-declined-greatly"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The annual risk of dying from cardiovascular disease has fallen dramatically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the chart below, you can see this decline across age groups. Across all ages, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease has fallen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note that the vertical scales vary between age groups; the risks are much higher at older ages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, women over 85 are about two-thirds less likely to die from cardiovascular disease today than women over 85 in 1950. This pattern is visible for both men and women, from young adulthood through old age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These rates can be combined into the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="age_standardized" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;age-standardized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; death rate from cardiovascular disease. This lets us understand how the risk has changed for people of the same age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s shown in the chart below. In the United States, that risk has fallen dramatically. In the 1950s, over 500 out of every 100,000 people died of cardiovascular disease each year. Today, that figure is below 150 — a decline of around three-quarters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This metric also lets us see if this improvement is unique to the United States or has happened elsewhere. As you can see, there have also been large declines in many other countries, including Australia, France, Canada, Germany, and Brazil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These gains haven’t simply shifted health risks to other causes. Instead, the drop in cardiovascular mortality is a major reason why overall death rates have fallen and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;life expectancy has risen globally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

Medical breakthroughs — in detection, treatment, surgery, and emergency care — have made &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;surviving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; cardiovascular disease much more likely. In addition, public health measures and lifestyle changes have stopped many people from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;developing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; it in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The twentieth century was a very exciting time to be a cardiovascular doctor or surgeon. Many breakthroughs have made surviving cardiovascular disease far more likely.

Just over a century ago, the heart was considered untouchable. Surgeons feared, often rightly at the time, that opening the chest would lead to massive bleeding or deadly infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="body-3-medium-italic article-block__aside article-block__aside--right col-start-11 span-cols-3 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Positive pressure ventilation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a way of mechanically pushing air into the patient’s lungs to keep them breathing. This is essential in open-chest surgery because opening the chest cavity can collapse the lungs, so they can’t inflate without assistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside class="body-3-medium-italic article-block__aside article-block__aside--right col-start-11 span-cols-3 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-lung machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; temporarily takes over the work of the heart and lungs by adding oxygen to the blood and pumping it around the body. This is crucial when the heart needs to be stopped for surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart surgery became possible through advances in anesthesia, antiseptics, blood transfusions, positive pressure ventilation, and the invention of the heart-lung machine. This opened the door to an organ that was previously seen as untouchable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are some other key advances over the past century:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article-block__list col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stabilising the heart’s rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In the late 1950s, doctors implanted the first &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="pacemaker" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;pacemaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which sends tiny electrical signals to keep the heart beating at a healthy rhythm when it slows down too much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-8" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; By the 1980s, implantable defibrillators were added to detect dangerous heart rhythms and deliver a shock to restore a normal heartbeat — helping prevent sudden death in people at high risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-9" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking inside the heart. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors first used &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="echocardiography" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;echocardiography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the early 1950s to watch the heart’s real-time movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-10" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; CT scans in the 1970s and MRIs in the 1980s brought clearer views of blockages and damage, without the need for surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-11" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Treating blocked arteries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; has transformed as well. In 1974, doctors first used &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="angioplasty" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;angioplasty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to thread a balloon into clogged arteries and restore blood flow. Doctors soon applied this to the coronary arteries, opening them up without needing open-heart surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-12" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="stent" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; — tiny mesh tubes that keep arteries open — followed in the 1980s, and in the 2000s, drug-coated versions (“drug-eluted stents”) were introduced to prevent re-narrowing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-13" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bypassing severe blockages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; When stents weren’t enough, surgeons could reroute blood around the blockage using a healthy vessel from another part of the body. This bypass surgery became a routine and life-saving option by the late 1960s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-14" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Repairing and replacing heart valves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In 1960, the first mechanical heart valve was implanted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-15" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Later, in the 2000s, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="percutaneous-aortic-valve-implantations" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;transcatheter valve replacement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; allowed damaged valves to be replaced through a thin tube instead of open surgery, offering a safer alternative for many patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-16" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Replacing the whole heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. For people with severe heart failure, the only solution might be a transplant. The first successful human heart transplant took place in 1967.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-17" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Precision through robotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Robotic assistance in surgery began in 1985, and precision was improved with tools like robotic arms or biopsy needles. Over time, more devices were added, and eventually they were combined in the first “da Vinci” surgical robot, which let surgeons perform complex operations through a small incision, with precise wrist-like instruments, all controlled from a console displaying a 3D view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-18" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="emergency-care"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emergency care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#emergency-care"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Saving lives from heart attacks and strokes hasn’t depended only on hospitals and doctors, but also on what happens in the first critical minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1930s, London introduced the world’s first “999” emergency phone line, allowing anyone to call for help quickly. The United States followed decades later, with the first “911” call in the 1960s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-19" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; As emergency phone systems expanded, emergency care and ambulances became more widely used. Alongside them, new tools and techniques were developed that allowed both professionals and bystanders to act quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the most important came in the 1950s, when cardiologist Paul Zoll developed the first external defibrillator. This device could deliver an electric shock to restart a stopped heart. This technology became portable, safer, and easier to use in the following years. Eventually, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="automated-external-defibrillator" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;automated external defibrillators (AEDs)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; were designed so ordinary people could follow voice instructions, apply pads, and deliver the life-saving shock within minutes, even before emergency services arrived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-20" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Around the same time, researchers developed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), another tool that would become central to emergency care. By the late 1950s, CPR — a combination of chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing — gave bystanders a way to keep blood and oxygen temporarily flowing until emergency care arrives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As these interventions became available, getting the wider public to recognize emergency signs became more valuable so they could respond quickly and effectively. Many large public awareness campaigns were launched. The American Heart Association led efforts in the US to teach people how to recognize heart attack symptoms — like chest pain, pressure, or pain in the arm — and to seek help immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-21" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; More recently, the UK’s “Act FAST” campaign helped people spot strokes by remembering four key signs: “Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech trouble, and Time to call 999.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-22" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together, these developments have prevented many heart attacks and strokes from becoming fatal. Many more people get treated within minutes, not hours, and that speed has saved many lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-23" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="public-health-efforts-and-lifestyle-changes-have-reduced-cardiovascular-risks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Public health efforts and lifestyle changes have reduced cardiovascular risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#public-health-efforts-and-lifestyle-changes-have-reduced-cardiovascular-risks"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the chart below, I’ve compiled some of the biggest risk factors of cardiovascular disease — obesity, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="hypertension" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;uncontrolled blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="cholesterol" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and cigarette smoking. Data on all four risk factors has been available from national surveys since 1999, so the chart focuses on the most recent decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can see that, over decades, obesity has worsened, but the other risk factors (uncontrolled blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and high cholesterol) have improved. Public policy opened the door, but millions also changed their daily habits. This led to a change in the risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One important reason for progress is the decline in smoking, thanks to tobacco control efforts. Cigarettes carry a mixture of carcinogens and harmful chemicals that injure blood vessels and fuel inflammation, which means fewer people smoking leads to fewer people developing clogged arteries and heart disease. In the 1960s, about 40% of US adults smoked cigarettes. Today, it’s less than 15%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-24" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another improvement has been with cholesterol. High levels of LDL cholesterol — sometimes called “bad cholesterol” — contribute to fatty deposits in arteries, raising the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Average cholesterol levels have fallen since the 2000s. This is likely the result of factors such as national screening programs to detect high cholesterol levels early,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-25" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; dietary guidelines that encouraged cutting trans and saturated fats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-26" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and due to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/cholesterol-levels-have-declined-among-american-adults-in-recent-decades" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a wider use of statins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; — drugs that lower cholesterol levels and help prevent dangerous buildups in arteries; they are one of the most prescribed drug classes today and play a key role in preventing heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-27" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uncontrolled high blood pressure is another major risk factor. High blood pressure can develop when blood vessels become stiffer or narrower — but it can also drive further damage by putting extra pressure on artery walls, making them more likely to weaken, clog, or rupture, leading to strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-28" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; The share of adults with high blood pressure has fallen since the late 1990s, likely due to better detection, better medication, and more routine monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, not all trends have been positive. Obesity has increased steadily and remains a major risk factor for heart disease — partly by raising blood pressure and cholesterol (which treatments have helped control), but also through other pathways like insulin resistance, inflammation, and extra strain on the heart. New treatments and weight loss medicines could help reverse this trend, but they’d need to be used widely to make a difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-29" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another factor often missed is vaccination for infections like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/influenza" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;influenza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and pneumococcal disease, which have also helped protect people from these infections that can trigger heart attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-30" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="article-block__horizontal-rule col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking back, it’s surprising to realize how many lifesaving tools we have today that didn’t exist until quite recently in history. Antiseptics to prevent infections, CPR to restart the heart, pacemakers to keep it beating, simple blood pressure cuffs to warn of hypertension: these tools are each so common we now rarely think about them or what life was like before them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The dramatic decline in cardiovascular deaths shows just how much can change with science, policy, and everyday habits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart disease is still the leading cause of death worldwide, killing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-cardiovascular-disease-ghe?tab=line&amp;amp;country=CHN~IND~ZAF~NGA~USA~FRA~BRA~AUS~PHL~OWID_WRL" class="span-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;around 20 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; people globally each year, and this tells us there’s still more to do. And some risks, like obesity and diabetes, have risen in many countries. They remind us that progress can stall or even reverse without more effort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But new advances are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible even further. 3D heart reconstructions help surgeons plan complex operations more precisely; new valve replacement techniques mean patients can recover faster without surgery; and newly developed weight loss drugs offer hope for tackling obesity across the population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fight against cardiovascular disease isn’t over.

Those nutrient powerhouses are one of the most popular and largely consumed foods around the world. One large egg delivers about 6–7 g of protein, all nine essential amino acids, and rich vitamins A, D, E, and B12, along with choline, lutein, zeaxanthin, and unsaturated fats. The yolk is the star for brain and eye health; whites offer pure, cholesterol-free protein. Perfect fuel for muscles, minds, and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, eggs are also affordable, easy to cook, and packed with protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Eating an egg a day: Is it good or bad for your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’re trying to eat healthier or build muscle, you may have wondered: Does the way you cook an egg change how much protein you get from it? Whether you prefer them boiled, scrambled, poached, or fried, each method can slightly affect the protein quality and how well your body absorbs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig deeper into the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="12918446" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Eggs-for-breakfast" source="Orion"&gt;Eggs for breakfast&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study featured in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo04248k/unauth" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has provided new insights into how egg intake relates to overall health. The research tracked nearly 19,000 adults and revealed that those who consumed around 1.5 eggs daily exhibited markedly stronger bones compared to individuals who completely avoided eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, participants who regularly included eggs in their diet displayed a 72% increase in bone density at the femur and an 83% increase in bone density at the spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results challenge earlier beliefs about the dangers of egg consumption and underscore their potential benefits for bone health, especially in adults prone to osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the study imply that eggs may offer more health benefits beyond just being a source of high-quality protein. The bone-supporting features of eggs are significant, with the study indicating that consistent consumption of this food could positively impact skeletal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cooking eggs and packing protein: The scientific approach&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cook an egg, the proteins in it go through a process called denaturation. The heat denatures the protein, which means it unfolds the tightly packed protein molecules, making them easier for your digestive enzymes to break down. That’s why cooked eggs offer more digestible protein than raw eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9644172/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20raw%20eggs%20h" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, your body can absorb about 91% of the protein in cooked eggs compared to just 51% in raw eggs. So even though the protein amount stays the same, your body benefits much more from cooked eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while Rocky Balboa may have slugged raw eggs for muscle gain, science says cooking is the better bet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preferred cooking method (ranked as per protein retention)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how different cooking methods stack up when it comes to protein:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Boiled eggs (Hard or soft-boiled)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best overall choice for protein lovers and health-conscious eaters, and an easy winner for protein purity and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Protein per egg:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; ~6.3g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Absorption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; High&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why it’s great:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boiling is one of the best methods to retain nutrients. Since there’s no added fat and minimal nutrient loss, boiled eggs offer almost the full protein content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health bonus:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less risk of oxidation or nutrient breakdown because of gentle heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best for:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meal prep, on-the-go snacks, salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Poached eggs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slightly lower than boiled, but nearly identical nutritionally. Moreover, excellent choice for clean eating and delicate dishes like avocado toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Protein per egg:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; ~6.2g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Absorption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; High&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like boiling, poaching uses water and low heat, which helps preserve most of the protein. It’s gentle and doesn’t introduce extra fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health bonus:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yolk stays soft, which protects heat-sensitive nutrients like choline and lutein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best for:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Breakfast bowls, avocado toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scrambled eggs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good, but don’t overcook to keep protein quality high. However, full points for being tasty and versatile (but be gentle with the heat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Protein per egg:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; ~6.1g (may increase if you add milk or cheese)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Absorption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moderate to high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why it’s tricky:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scrambling breaks the egg structure and often uses added fats or milk. These additions don’t reduce protein, but overcooking can make the protein harder to digest. Furthermore, scrambling often uses high heat and can lead to overcooking, which may slightly reduce the protein quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health bonus:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still a solid source of protein, but adding butter, milk, or cheese raises fat and calorie content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best for:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quick breakfasts, mixed with veggies or cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="113"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fried eggs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still provides protein, but it’s not the healthiest option. Tasty, but slightly less efficient if cooked hard or crispy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="120"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Protein per egg:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; ~6.2g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Absorption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moderate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="126"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why it’s a mixed bag:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frying introduces higher temperatures and added fats, which may affect protein structure if eggs are cooked too long or at too high heat. If the egg gets crispy or browned, some proteins can degrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health bonus:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tastes great, but adds calories and possibly oxidized fats depending on the oil used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="133"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best for:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Classic breakfast plates, burgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="137"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bonus method&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="138"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one’s very Gen Z-coded, hence a mixed bag! Microwaved eggs: quick and easy. Contrary to popular beliefs, microwave cooking can preserve most nutrients and protein, as long as you don’t overcook. Try microwaving with minimal water or oil to replicate poaching or soft-boiling effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="140"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="141"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best method for the most protein from eggs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="142"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clear winner is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;boiled eggs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Boiling wins for several reasons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="146"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Maintains full protein content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="148"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="149"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;No added fats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="151"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="152"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Gentle cooking method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="154"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="155"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Great for storage and meal prep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="157"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="158"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poached eggs are a close second. Scrambled eggs follow, just don’t overheat them. Fried eggs are still good for protein, but they rank lowest in terms of health and absorption if overcooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="162"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="164"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;A few more tips?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="166"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Don’t overcook:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; High heat can make proteins tougher and slightly harder to digest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="169"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Skip raw:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raw egg whites contain avidin, which binds to biotin and reduces absorption. Plus, cooking eggs boosts protein availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="172"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Keep the yolk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people discard yolks to lower fat, but they also contain important protein and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="176"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Add healthy sides:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pair with whole grains or greens to create a balanced, protein-packed meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="179"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="180"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The final verdict&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="181"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how you like your eggs, you’re already doing your body a favor. They’re budget-friendly, filling, and full of nutrients. But if you want to get the most protein with the least effort and added fat, go for boiled or poached eggs.

&lt;p&gt;You often hear about the importance of building muscle for longevity, but another important part of aging well is looking after your bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people reach peak bone mass &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/staying-healthy/healthy-bones-at-every-age/" target="_blank" data-url="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/staying-healthy/healthy-bones-at-every-age/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;between the ages of 20 and 30&lt;/a&gt;, but this can differ depending on your sex and genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, your body naturally begins to lose bone mass from your mid-to-late 30s, but you can slow down the process with the right nutrition and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diane Carroll is an orthopedic physical therapist at the Hospital for Special Surgery at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hss.edu/locations/florida/hss-at-nch" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hss.edu/locations/florida/hss-at-nch" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Naples Comprehensive Health&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, and she says there are three exercises she’d recommend for people who want to improve bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Weight training is very good for building bone,” Carroll tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean you have to lift weights—any form of resistance strength training will help you improve your bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn't need to be anything heavy,” she adds. “It could be a resistance band, it could be a weight or it could be your bodyweight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KoBA3VVhogtQNCzFPP2kXB" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KoBA3VVhogtQNCzFPP2kXB slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the three moves she recommends for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-diane-carroll-s-three-move-routine-for-better-bone-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diane Carroll’s three move routine for better bone health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to build bone in a specific area, you should aim to strengthen the muscles in that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’re focused on building better overall health, full-body exercises work well—"the simpler the better," says Carroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-sit-to-stand"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Sit to stand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The muscles in your legs are very functional,” Carroll says. “This movement replicates what they need to do all day—standing up from a chair, pushing you up onto a curb and holding you up against gravity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on a standard height chair with both feet on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push through your feet and extend your legs to stand up without using your arms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back and bend your knees to sit back down without using your arms. Try not to hunch or arch your back and keep your core engaged throughout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-calf-raise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

Standing leg raise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your leg straight, torso still and spine in a neutral position throughout, raise your right leg in front of you, then lower it with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise your right leg out to the side, then lower it with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise your right leg behind you, then lower it with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continue for 30 seconds, then repeat on your left leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight essential nutrients make up the suite of B vitamins also known as the B complex. Researchers from Tufts University and elsewhere have revealed that these B vitamins influence a vast spectrum of human health and disease, including cognitive function, cardiovascular health, gastric bypass recovery, neural tube defects, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to study the B vitamins in isolation," says gastroenterologist Joel Mason, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) and professor at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy and Tufts University School of Medicine. "Four of these B-vitamins cooperate as co-factors in many critical activities in cells in what we call 'one carbon metabolism'."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One carbon metabolism is a series of pathways that allow for the transfer of single-carbon units to cells for essential processes such as DNA synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and more. It's their role in all these crucial biological functions that make the B vitamins so important-and so challenging to tease out how they contribute positively and, perhaps negatively, to human health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mason and two additional researchers who spent their careers studying one or more of the B vitamins explain what we currently know about how the five of the most prominently researched B vitamins impact or improve cognitive as well as cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cognitive health, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and folate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most active areas for B vitamin research is cognitive health. By the age of 75-80, 40% of people have a diminished ability to absorb food-bound B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, says Mason. This deficiency leads to a decline in nerve health, particularly in the spine and brain, which can contribute to the risk of developing dementia in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, clinicians and researchers thought measuring plasma B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;was accurate enough to determine if supplementation was needed. However, Mason says, while many elderly people may have B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels that are in the 'low to normal' range, they are simultaneously developing neurological deficits linked to vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;deficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contribution of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency to cognitive decline and the vascular disease that results in many cases of dementia is under-diagnosed and under-reported."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irwin H. Rosenberg, Jean Mayer University Professor Emeritus, Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg is also a former dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy who also taught pharmacology at the School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Age-related cognitive decline is not just Alzheimer's," says Rosenberg. "We've lumped together many kinds of brain dysfunction under one name. And in doing so, we've overlooked how critical blood vessels-and by extension, nutrition-are to preserving brain function."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pathology of Alzheimer's disease described the abnormal buildup of two proteins in the brain-amyloid and tau-which clump together, forming plaques and tangles which are believed to disrupt brain cell function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet Rosenberg says cerebrovascular disease and small vessel disease, which in some cases are connected to B vitamin deficiency, is more prevalent with cognitive decline and dementia than the buildup of harmful proteins in the brain, which has been the focus of so much research and drug development to treat Alzheimer's disease. Treating people with drugs meant to address the protein buildup will not work if the cause of dementia symptoms is a B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing to identify whether cognitive decline and dementia symptoms may be caused by a B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;deficiency is therefore imperative, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; tests measure all B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in your system, even though approximately 80% is inactive," says Paul Jacques, senior scientist at the HNRCA and professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pinpoint a B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency requires two additional tests. One, called the MMA test, measures levels of methymalonic acid, an acid produced during certain aspects of metabolism requiring adequate B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. "It can be elevated with even a mild B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, indicating a potential higher risk of dementia," says Jacques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second test measures levels of an amino acid, homocysteine, which is also a byproduct of metabolism requiring B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. If only homocysteine levels are elevated, a folate deficiency may be the problem. If both MMA and homocysteine are high, a B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;deficiency is the likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a patient presents with neurological issues or signs of dementia, conducting all three tests will narrow down if a B vitamin deficiency is involved-and which B vitamin it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unlike changes that we are unable to see in patients being given expensive anti-amyloid antibody drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, there is actually evidence that fairly early in the course of cognitive decline we can slow the process if the underlying cause is elevated homocysteine or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-related deficiency," says Rosenberg. "It's my recommendation that patients, with or without anemia, should be screened for elevated homocysteine or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency because that may be one of the reversible factors in their cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't a new theory. Two decades ago, studies like the Framingham Heart Study showed that elevated homocysteine predicted brain atrophy and a higher risk of dementia. More recently, trials such as VITACOG and FACT have shown that B vitamin supplementation can slow brain shrinkage and improve cognitive performance in those at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is an enormous amount of education needed around this issue," Rosenberg says. "We hope to convince cardiologists, neurologists, and internists to measure B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;and homocysteine levels as part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment. Even the modest effects from vitamins that cost pennies a day can be very meaningful in those who will benefit, especially when you compare vitamin supplementation to costly drugs that are getting much more attention yet may have the same or even less benefit."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;and dementia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacques and colleagues currently are leading a study using data from about 2,500 middle-aged and older adults in the Framingham Heart Study, all of whom were free of dementia in the 1990s and all of whom received B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, MMA, and homocysteine testing for the last 20+ years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk of dementia and late-stage Alzheimer's begins to increase when one is 75 years old or older, but evidence suggests that some of the pathological changes associated with dementia and Alzheimer's may start to develop 20+ years before clinical symptoms and diagnosis occurs," says Jacques. "This study should give us a good handle on whether B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is related to cognitive decline and dementia. If so, hopefully we can identify a simple, inexpensive intervention that could be started years in advance and before real damage occurs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jacques is also looking at the role folate (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) may play in the development of cognitive issues, specifically the influence high levels of folate might have on B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, people with anemia were treated with folic acid, the synthetic form of folate. Unfortunately, it became clear that while pharmaceutical level treatment with folic acid alleviated anemia, it often masked or exacerbated B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. "Scientists observed that people with low B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and high folic acid concentrations tended to have cognitive issues," Jacques says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent research suggested that it wasn't total B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations that folic acid might be affecting, but perhaps just one component, holoTC, which is the form of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; that is crucial for transporting and using B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in cells and is considered a potentially better indicator of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; status. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacques and colleagues are conducting two studies to tease apart the issues involved. "In the first, our B vitamin and brain aging study, we will look at the influence high folate status has on the relationships between B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt;and cognitive health. A second study we are doing in collaboration with Rutgers will look at the effect of high folic acid in the blood on the two forms of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; -holoTC and unbound cobalamin."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Heart disease, cholesterol, and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B vitamins have also stirred excitement among researchers because of their possible role in heart disease and stroke prevention, but thus far their utility as a clinical treatment remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists discovered in the early 2000s that riboflavin (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) could decrease blood pressure very effectively. It is believed that riboflavin improves a biochemical reaction mediated by a gene called MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) that helps the body use folate. Riboflavin is only effective in reducing blood pressure specifically in patients with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and folate help the body rid itself of homocysteine, which in overabundance had been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, as well as dementia. However, a number of clinical trials in the 1980s showed that B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and folate supplementation didn't decrease heart attacks, but did slightly lower the risk of strokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niacin (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can lower LDL (the so-called "bad cholesterol") and raise HDL (the so-called "good cholesterol"). "But it has to be taken in such large doses that it often causes very uncomfortable flushing, like hot flashes," says Mason. "People often can't tolerate taking it, and other drug options are available that lower blood LDL that do not have such unpleasant side effects."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chronic inflammation and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most promising for the future is the role vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6 &lt;/sub&gt;may play in curbing &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-Inflammation-Do-to-the-Body.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which has been identified as an underlying feature of many chronic diseases, from heart disease to diabetes to arthritis to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of animal studies, plus some human studies, suggest that supplemental B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can reduce inflammation. "Again, we are talking about giving B vitamins at an appropriate pharmaceutical level under the care of a clinician," cautions Mason. "B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can be toxic in large amounts." He sees this research as an area to watch in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-leaderboard-320"&gt;

From filtering the blood to converting excess glucose into glycogen, it plays many roles. Hence, it is important to take extra care of the liver, and the best way to do so is by feeding it with nutrient-rich foods. Dr. Joseph Salhab, a gastroenterologist and advocate for healthy diets that benefit the digestive system, liver, and pancreas, recently talked about five fruits that can naturally hydrate and support the liver. In a video on Instagram, he explained that these fruits contain compounds that help relax blood vessels, improving blood flow to the liver. This, in turn, enhances the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the liver, supporting its metabolic processes. Also, a study published by the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10123163/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; suggests that higher fruit consumption may be linked to a reduced risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in some populations. Take a look at the five fruits suggested by Dr. Joseph and how they work their magic in keeping the liver healthy and the right way to consume them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:41:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>经常被忽视的结肠癌的五个常见征兆-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6wFBVV95cUxOLU1PdzZiTE9aMFRGZk0zWW80blp6a0JoZkdhakwzTUtjZlNQRkc2WXlPMlRiQlk4b1BoWXZZZ0hLYy1IVzltNmNlamJ1WFJ3eThMUmphSDlZT2hsNUVfVXI0Vi1DTy1ZTkNjX19iWlBPSUJ3SDN1Tk56ZDYwWjF2d1ktSnkwTEVHYUp0NzQwZURaYnhndHJheUFwUGVsVEk0ZnhwR1FmckdrZmFsdV9PRFhGZndPRFZNbTlJTFR1c2JWNHpiTERXc3hFa2c1V1k1Tks4a0RsSlVnSG9nYVpuWjI5RHJmR2p5NGRr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2020, more than 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer were reported, and it claimed 930,000 lives worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;). The agency also predicts that new colon cancer cases will rise to 3.2 million (an increase of 63%) per year by 2040, and the deaths will spike to 1.6 million per year (an increase of 73%). Early detection, therefore, is crucial to improve outcomes. However, many early symptoms are subtle, and the chances of it getting dismissed or mistaken for other, relatively less bothersome health concerns are high. This delays diagnosis, which negatively affects treatment plans and outcomes. Here are the five signs of colon cancer that are often ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxOLU1PdzZiTE9aMFRGZk0zWW80blp6a0JoZkdhakwzTUtjZlNQRkc2WXlPMlRiQlk4b1BoWXZZZ0hLYy1IVzltNmNlamJ1WFJ3eThMUmphSDlZT2hsNUVfVXI0Vi1DTy1ZTkNjX19iWlBPSUJ3SDN1Tk56ZDYwWjF2d1ktSnkwTEVHYUp0NzQwZURaYnhndHJheUFwUGVsVEk0ZnhwR1FmckdrZmFsdV9PRFhGZndPRFZNbTlJTFR1c2JWNHpiTERXc3hFa2c1V1k1Tks4a0RsSlVnSG9nYVpuWjI5RHJmR2p5NGRr</guid></item><item><title>一位步行专家说，如果您不锻炼身体，这些练习将帮助您建立再次行走的力量- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxOTlJrQURiaWZOUmpuR1pYdlFEZ2tGWnR3bTNPc2hfdEVEWnJFdjJfZHlxbk5zZUdoYXNmUDUyRDA2OGJka0FYZlNYLUEyR01JcEVSRXQySHRCeHZJYnhHR2d6VDR5dEhOaXY1ZjBQbFBkN2FoNVkxcGdtUzIza0xJcTBHSGkwVWo4Q0xVYzZjajhJeV9YZlhPTkkyclVzOS00LUNMVlpLNFBIbnBiUGdsMnFHRHp5Q0pnMUwtNzRJUjNRZUR2eDFadEFPem1sUTBUSDNBVXJ1eTh5SmR2ME5TOGdRWkNPbjU5aXpyTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and fitness titles like ours often offer advice about increasing step count, hitting a certain number every day and clocking up double-digit mileage for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you’ve taken time off from your regular amount of walking? Maybe an illness, an injury or some other misfortune has gotten in the way of getting your steps in. You can end up losing a lot of the basic attributes you need for walking safely, such as balance, strength and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milica McDowell, a doctor of physical therapy, exercise physiologist, and VP of operations for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gaithappens.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://gaithappens.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Gait Happens&lt;/a&gt;, explains what you need to be doing to build up the foundational walking components that will make your return to walking easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of ways to prepare your body to walk before you even begin walking,” she says, suggesting the below six moves in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, whether you’re new to regular walks, returning after a break or just keen to stay injury-free, try these exercises to ensure a safe and successful step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-single-leg-swing"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Single leg swing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During walking, you are in a single-leg stance part of the time,” McDowell explains. “When you're swinging one leg through, you need to be able to balance on just the other one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell says that single leg balance is an important component of walking, alongside postural control and overall balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-nAtPL389rJ5BdyDtpRz3u5" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-nAtPL389rJ5BdyDtpRz3u5 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of a single leg swing is that it helps the body to achieve the rhythm it will be using when walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The arms swing and the pelvis rotates a little bit, so it’s great for people to do at home safely if they're looking to do some preparatory work before they even start walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-sit-to-stand"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Sit to stand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a strength training perspective, moving from sitting to standing—either out of a chair or holding onto a counter and doing little mini squats—trains a lot of the muscles that we use during walking,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-calf-raise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Calf raise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another exercise that's great is holding on to a counter and doing a calf raise or a heel raise because your calf muscles are playing an integral part in the propulsion of your legs when you're walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell explains that if someone has difficulty going up a flight of stairs or getting out of a chair, these types of exercise can help them prepare their body to tolerate walking with less risk of a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-single-leg-balance"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“During the walking cycle, you're on a single leg about 40% of the time,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests that you start by holding onto a counter and shifting your body weight from leg to leg. Once you are comfortable with this, you can then lift each leg one at a time and practice standing on one leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell explains that this exercise can be challenging and sometimes frightening for people with a history of balance challenges or falls, so it helps to build balance, but also confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-arm-swing"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Arm Swing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another thing we encourage people to do is work on unlocking their arm swing and unlocking their torso. And so they can even just stand and work on swinging their arms and letting their torso move,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people have been immobile for a while or their bodies have become stiff or they're working through some pain conditions, they tend to get tight, and arm swinging is the type of movement that they are likely to subconsciously limit. The less natural your walking pattern is, the more likely you are to fall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-big-toe-press"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Big toe press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are often surprised that this has such an impact, but big toe strength is one of the biggest predictors of risk of falls. If your big toe is weak, your fall risk will be much higher,” explains McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sit in a chair barefoot and press down with just your big toe, like you’re stepping on a gas pedal or pushing a piano key. You want to press and hold just with the big toe, with all the other toes relaxed and then release.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you can do that comfortably, you can start trying this big toe push from standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;The clock read 3:47 AM when I found myself staring at the ceiling again, mind racing like I'd just chugged three espressos. No alarm. No noise. Just my brain deciding that the middle of the night was prime time for consciousness. If this sounds familiar, you're part of a surprisingly large club—one that meets nightly in the liminal space between deep sleep and dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, I assumed this was just another quirk of modern life, like doom-scrolling or having strong opinions about oat milk brands. But after diving into the research (spurred by my own obsessive sleep tracking), I discovered something fascinating: these early morning wake-ups might be your body trying to communicate something important about your circadian rhythm, stress levels, or overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The science of the 3 AM club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's actually happening when you bolt awake at ungodly hours: Your body follows a complex 24-hour cycle that governs everything from hormone production to body temperature. Around 2-3 AM, something interesting occurs—your cortisol levels begin their natural rise, preparing your body for eventual morning awakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, this rise is gradual, gently nudging you toward consciousness around 6 or 7 AM. But for many of us, this system has gone haywire. Dr. Michael Breus's research on sleep chronotypes suggests that our modern environment has stretched the natural variation in sleep patterns to extremes we've never seen before in human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like this: Your cortisol is supposed to be a slow-building crescendo, but stress turns it into a jarring alarm bell. When you're already running high on stress hormones during the day, that &lt;a href="https://www.ptsduk.org/sleep-and-cortisol-in-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;natural 3 AM rise can overflow your metaphorical cup&lt;/a&gt;, yanking you into consciousness when you should be in deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why your sleep cycles matter more than you think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every night, you cycle through different &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stages of sleep&lt;/a&gt; approximately every 90-120 minutes. The fascinating part? The architecture of these cycles changes throughout the night. Early on, you get more deep, restorative sleep. But as morning approaches, you spend more time in REM sleep—the stage where your brain is almost as active as when you're awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things become crucial. REM sleep is when your brain processes emotions and consolidates memories. It's also when you're most likely to wake up and actually remember it. Those 3-5 AM wake-ups often coincide with longer REM periods, which might explain why your brain feels so annoyingly alert—it's already revved up, processing the day's experiences and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matthew Walker's research shows that even short-term sleep debt can disrupt this delicate dance, creating a cascade of effects that make quality sleep increasingly elusive. Think of it as a snowball rolling downhill—each night of poor sleep makes the next night harder, accumulating into an avalanche of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The chronotype connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone's internal clock runs on the same schedule. Some of us are &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-03-17-having-genetics-night-owl-protects-night-shift-workers-against-sleep-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;genetically programmed night owls&lt;/a&gt;, while others are natural early birds. The research reveals something surprising—scientists have identified at least nine different genes that influence whether you're more likely to thrive at dawn or come alive after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the kicker: our modern world has &lt;a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2020/night-owl-chronotypes-in-a-morning-lark-world-122120" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pushed these natural variations to extremes&lt;/a&gt;. Where morning larks and night owls might have been separated by just a few hours in pre-industrial times, we now see spreads of up to 12 hours between extreme chronotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because fighting your natural chronotype is like swimming upstream—possible, but exhausting. If you're a night owl forced into a morning lark's schedule, those 3 AM wake-ups might be your body's protest against social jet lag, the disconnect between your internal clock and external demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What your body might be trying to tell you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tracking my sleep for months (yes, I became that person), patterns emerged. The nights I woke at 3 AM weren't random—they followed days of high stress, late-night screen time, or when I'd pushed through exhaustion instead of listening to my body's signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up. Studies show that chronic stress creates a vicious cycle: elevated cortisol disrupts sleep, poor sleep increases stress, and round and round we go. It's like being stuck in a biological escape room where the only exit is better sleep hygiene—which feels impossible when you can't sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not just stress. These wake-ups can signal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accumulated sleep debt&lt;/strong&gt;: Your body cycles through sleep stages differently to compensate for chronic under-sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar fluctuations&lt;/strong&gt;: Late-night snacks or skipped dinners can cause metabolic disruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circadian misalignment&lt;/strong&gt;: Your internal clock is out of sync with your lifestyle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormonal shifts&lt;/strong&gt;: Particularly relevant during perimenopause or other life transitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The recovery paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where it gets frustrating: the research on "catching up" on sleep is mixed at best. That weekend sleep-in you're banking on? It might not fix the problem. One study found it takes &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weekend-catch-up-sleep-wont-fix-the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation-on-your-waistline-2019092417861" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four days to recover&lt;/a&gt; from just one hour of lost sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science suggests that consistency matters more than marathon sleep sessions. Your circadian rhythm craves routine like a houseplant craves sunlight—regular, predictable, and at the right times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What actually works (based on science and self-experimentation)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of trial and error, here's what moved the needle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light is everything&lt;/strong&gt;: Our circadian rhythms evolved with natural light cycles. Getting bright light exposure within 30 minutes of waking and dimming lights 2-3 hours before bed made a bigger difference than any supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cortisol management game&lt;/strong&gt;: Since that 3 AM cortisol spike is inevitable, the goal is managing your baseline. Regular exercise (but not too late), stress-reduction practices that actually work for you (not just what Instagram wellness influencers suggest), and protecting your wind-down time all help keep that cortisol cup from overflowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature hacking&lt;/strong&gt;: Your body temperature naturally drops during sleep. Keeping the bedroom cool (around 65-68°F) and taking a warm shower before bed (the subsequent cooling mimics your natural temperature drop) can help maintain sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace your chronotype&lt;/strong&gt;: Stop fighting your genetics. If you're a natural night owl, trying to become a 5 AM workout person might be making things worse. Work with your biology, not against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those 3 AM wake-ups taught me something important: our bodies are constantly communicating with us, but we've gotten terrible at listening. In our always-on culture, we treat sleep like an inconvenience to optimize rather than a fundamental biological need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is clear: sleep isn't just about quantity—it's about quality, timing, and consistency. Those early morning wake-ups might be annoying, but they're also data points in understanding your body's needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After implementing these changes, my 3 AM wake-ups shifted from nightly occurrences to occasional visitors. More importantly, I stopped seeing them as failures and started seeing them as feedback. Sometimes I still find myself staring at the ceiling in the pre-dawn darkness, but now I know it's not just insomnia—it's biology trying to find balance in an unbalanced world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution isn't perfection; it's paying attention. Your body is remarkably good at self-regulation when you give it the right conditions. Those 3 AM wake-ups? They're not your enemy. They're your internal clock asking for a conversation about how you're living your days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, it's time we started listening.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mere sight of a sick person may set off an alarm system in your brain and body, even if they are too far away to infect you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of experiments using virtual reality headsets has now revealed just how  "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02008-y"&gt;exquisitely sensitive&lt;/a&gt;" our brains are to symptoms of sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants saw a virtual avatar at varying distances showing clear signs of illness (like a feverish rash), their brains suddenly kicked into gear and their immune systems were put on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they saw a healthy, neutral-looking avatar, on the other hand, their brains did not show the same activation patterns, and their bloodwork lacked an immediate elevation in immune markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mere-thought-of-being-hungry-could-alter-your-immune-system?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Mere Thought of Being Hungry Could Alter Your Immune System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these markers are known as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs can spike in the blood when the body is directly exposed to a pathogen, but all&lt;span&gt; it took in this case was the sight of a virtual infection and the mere prospect of exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, these data show that ILCs react to infections not only when they are detected in the body but also when they are processed as a potential threat approaching the body," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02008-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the international team of authors, led by immunologist Sara Trabanelli from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169460" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169460" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VRHeadsetExperiment-642x204.png" alt="VR Headset Trial" class="size-medium wp-image-169460" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VRHeadsetExperiment-642x204.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VRHeadsetExperiment-1024x326.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VRHeadsetExperiment-768x244.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VRHeadsetExperiment-1536x489.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VRHeadsetExperiment-2048x652.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/VRHeadsetExperiment-600x191.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169460" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;a) Participants were first exposed to a neutral avatar (baseline) and then shown either neutral, infectious, or fearful avatars. b) Avatars were presented at one of five distances (D5 = far, D1 = near).

Interestingly, some of these activated areas are the same as those that can be triggered after a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169457" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccine is given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that when the brain senses a looming threat, it responds rapidly, triggering activity in brain parts like the hypothalamus, which then communicate with the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives the body time to put up a fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/reaction_times_sensory_642.jpg" alt="graphs" class="wp-image-169991 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/reaction_times_sensory_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/reaction_times_sensory_642-313x415.jpg 313w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/reaction_times_sensory_642-600x794.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphs showing the greatest difference between control and test reaction times were during the infection cohort trial.

The anticipation probably evolved as a fight-or-flight response, the researchers suspect, though they caution there's still a lot to resolve, including how perceived infectiousness and disgust interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest an integrated neuro–immune reaction in humans toward infection threats, not solely following physical contact," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02008-y"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our brains for staying vigilant on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02008-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: You're at your doctor's office with a sore throat. The nurse asks, "Any allergies?" And without hesitation you reply, "Penicillin." It's something you've said for years – maybe since childhood, maybe because a parent told you so. The nurse nods, makes a note and moves on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the kicker: There's a good chance you're not actually allergic to penicillin. About 10% to 20% of Americans report that they have a penicillin allergy, yet &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2010.08.002"&gt;fewer than 1% actually do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm a &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.auburn.edu/directory/elizabeth-covington.php"&gt;clinical associate professor of pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; specializing in infectious disease. I study antibiotics and drug allergies, including ways to determine whether people have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy7020069"&gt;penicillin allergies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xC3XXhgAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;from my research&lt;/a&gt; that incorrectly being labeled as allergic to penicillin can prevent you from getting the most appropriate, safest treatment for an infection. It can also put you at an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/antibiotic-resistance-is-at-a-crisis-point-government-support-for-academia-and-big-pharma-to-find-new-drugs-could-help-defeat-superbugs-169443"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is when an antibiotic no longer works against bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/semen-allergies-arent-rare-after-all-and-yes-men-have-them-too?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Semen Allergies Aren't Rare After All (And Yes, Men Have Them Too)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? It's gotten a lot easier in recent years to pin down the truth of the matter. More and more clinicians now recognize that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.6100"&gt;many penicillin allergy labels are incorrect&lt;/a&gt; – and there are safe, simple ways to find out your actual allergy status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A steadfast lifesaver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penicillin, &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html"&gt;the first antibiotic drug&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/5/16-1556_article"&gt;discovered in 1928&lt;/a&gt; when a physician named Alexander Fleming extracted it from a type of mold called penicillium. It became widely used to treat infections &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/guns-not-roses-heres-the-true-story-of-penicillins-first-patient-178463"&gt;in the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. Penicillin and closely related antibiotics such as &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a685001.html"&gt;amoxicillin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-oral-route/description/drg-20072709"&gt;amoxicillin/clavulanate&lt;/a&gt;, which goes by the brand name Augmentin, are frequently prescribed to treat common infections such as ear infections, strep throat, urinary tract infections,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="169975" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and dental infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penicillin antibiotics are a class of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, which means they target specific types of bacteria. People who report having a penicillin allergy are more likely to receive &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16386-antibiotics"&gt;broad-spectrum antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;. Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill many types of bacteria, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-healthy-microbiome-builds-a-strong-immune-system-that-could-help-defeat-covid-19-145668"&gt;including helpful ones&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for resistant bacteria to survive and spread. This overuse speeds up the development of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2010.08.002"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can also be less effective and are often costlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the mismatch?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often get labeled as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-2497"&gt;allergic to antibiotics as children&lt;/a&gt; when they have a reaction such as a rash after taking one. But skin rashes frequently occur alongside infections in childhood, with &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/parents-pack/rash-information"&gt;many viruses and infections actually causing rashes&lt;/a&gt;. If a child is taking an antibiotic at the time, they may be labeled as allergic even though the rash may have been caused by the illness itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as nausea, diarrhea or headaches can happen with antibiotics, but they don't always mean you are allergic. These common reactions usually go away on their own or can be managed. A doctor or pharmacist can talk to you about ways to reduce these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also often assume penicillin allergies run in families, but having a relative with an allergy doesn't mean you're allergic – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.6100"&gt;it's not hereditary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, about 80% of patients with a true penicillin allergy will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2010.08.002"&gt;lose the allergy&lt;/a&gt; after about 10 years. That means even if you used to be allergic to this antibiotic, you might not be anymore, depending on the timing of your reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does it matter if I have a penicillin allergy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believing you're allergic to penicillin when you're not can negatively affect your health. For one thing, you are more likely to receive stronger, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2010.08.002"&gt;broad-spectrum antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; that aren't always the best fit and can have more side effects. You may also be more likely to get an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix794"&gt;infection after surgery&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/ijam.ijam_48_22"&gt;spend longer in the hospital&lt;/a&gt; when hospitalized for an infection. What's more, your &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2017.12.033"&gt;medical bills could end up higher&lt;/a&gt; due to using more expensive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penicillin and its close cousins are often the best tools doctors have to treat many infections. If you're not truly allergic, figuring that out can open the door to safer, more effective and more affordable treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I tell if I am really allergic to penicillin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by talking to a health care professional such as a doctor or pharmacist. Allergy symptoms can range from a mild, self-limiting rash to severe facial swelling and trouble breathing. A health care professional &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy7020069"&gt;may ask you several questions&lt;/a&gt; about your allergies, such as what happened, how soon after starting the antibiotic did the reaction occur, whether treatment was needed, and whether you've taken similar medications since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions can help distinguish between a true allergy and a nonallergic reaction. In many cases, this interview is enough to determine you aren't allergic. But sometimes, further testing may be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to find out whether you're really allergic to penicillin is through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2018.07.041"&gt;penicillin skin testing&lt;/a&gt;, which includes tiny skin pricks and small injections under the skin. These tests use components related to penicillin to &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/allergy-testing"&gt;safely check for a true allergy&lt;/a&gt;. If skin testing doesn't cause a reaction, the next step is usually to take a small dose of amoxicillin while being monitored at your doctor's office, just to be sure it's safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in 2023 showed that in many cases, skipping the skin test and going &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.2986"&gt;straight to the small test dose&lt;/a&gt; can also be a safe way to check for a true allergy. In this method, patients take a low dose of amoxicillin and are observed for about 30 minutes to see whether any reaction occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the right questions, testing and expertise, many people can safely reclaim penicillin as an option for treating common infections.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253839/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
