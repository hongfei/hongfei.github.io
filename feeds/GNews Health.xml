         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6ehrbx00ez27nz8q5mah9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The sperm of a man carrying a rare genetic mutation linked to cancer was used to conceive scores of children across Europe, prompting calls for greater regulation and a limit on the number of births allowed from a single donor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6f28yt0019356mi4u63088@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sperm from the donor was used to conceive at least 67 children from 46 families born between 2008 and 2015, said Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, during a presentation at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics in Milan on Saturday. Ten of the children have already been diagnosed with cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6gpozu0032356m20wplwun@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the heart of the problem seems to lie the regulation, or maybe the lack of regulation, of the number of births by a single donor,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6fbgec001h356mnl0ldvaa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Analysis showed that the donor, who is himself healthy, had a rare mutation in a gene named TP53, which is likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare disorder that increases a person’s risk of developing cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6g0cqy002f356mt26tu9v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mutation was not known when the donation was made, but children born from this donor have since been identified in eight different European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, said Kasper in her presentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6h3hcg003r356mws22fe23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ten of them have been diagnosed with cancers such as brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma, and another 13 children are carrying the gene but have not yet developed a cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6grtpp0038356mj36e1xzb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They will require regular medical examinations due to their increased risk of developing cancer, and have a 50% chance of transmitting it on to their own children, said Kasper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6hdhbx0000356mqy0a5m1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The follow-up protocol involves whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, for adults, of the breast, ultrasound examination of the abdomen, and a clinical examination by a specialist. This is heavy and stressful for carriers, but we have seen its effectiveness in that it has enabled early detection of tumours and thus improved patients’ chances of survival,” said Kasper in a press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6gs1d2003b356mqi9pax0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike in some cases of serial sperm donors, such as a Dutch man &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2023/04/28/world/dutch-father-sperm-donor-children-scandal-intl-hnk"&gt;who was ordered to stop donating sperm&lt;/a&gt; after being found to have fathered between 500 and 600 children around the world, this man only donated to a single private sperm bank in Denmark named the European Sperm Bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6etx0b000i356m7yftddp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Julie Paulli Budtz, vice-president of corporate communications at the European Sperm Bank, told CNN that it was “deeply affected by this case.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6g2vt0002j356mhdwjne0t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The donor has been thoroughly tested even above the required standards, but preventative genetic screening is reaching its limits here,” she said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6g5hvu002r356mp40an3cn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every human being has about 20,000 genes, and it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6eyeap0013356mii49caa5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is currently no limit on the number of children that are allowed to be born using a single donor, something which Budtz said the European Sperm Bank would like to change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6eq1er000d356m0z6wzxni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is also why, in addition to following national pregnancy limits, we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6k96mt0000356m8qfbw095@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This limit is self-imposed as regulations vary from country to country. For example, France has a limit of 10 births per donor, while Denmark allows 12 and Germany allows up to 15, according to the press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6iulzj0002356mwgocyx4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a major issue here concerning a lack of harmonised regulation across Europe,” Kasper said in the release. “We need proper regulation at European level to try to prevent it happening again, and to implement measures to ensure a worldwide limit on the number of offspring conceived from the same donor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Not only do they provide fiber, carbs and important micronutrients, they can also boost gut health and, depending on the fruit, improve a wide variety of functions in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Like vegetables, fruit, of course, is seasonal, which means that certain types pack in the most nutrients during specific times of year. But if you don't have access to fresh produce year-round, the good news is that eating frozen fruit actually has as many health benefits — plus you don't have the same time crunch for eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One fruit in particular has an especially short period where it's in season but is versatile with powerful health-boosting compounds.

"Many people don’t realize that frozen fruits and veggies are actually just as nutritious as fresh. They are frozen at the peak of freshness, locking in all the nutrients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-56e38e" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One cup of cherries has 25% of your daily vitamin C, an anti-inflammatory nutrient that aids in immune function. Cherries also have anthocyanins, which are antioxidants that give cherries their red color and reduce the risk of chronic diseases, like heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/health/are-cherries-good-for-you-rcna156645" target="_blank"&gt;Cherries&lt;/a&gt; can also boost skin health, sleep and exercise recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-de15b9" class="body-heading"&gt;How To Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"I always add cherries to my smoothies to add natural sweetness and fight inflammation," Rizzo says. "They are especially nice in a post-workout smoothie to ease inflammation in the joints. Plus, cherries are only in season for a short amount of time, so keeping my freezer stocked with them means I can eat them all year round."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-46318e" class="styles_card__SCi76" data-testid="article-card"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_imageWrapper__O37vg" data-testid="article-card-image"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_tiltWrapper__BcdP_"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/workout-recovery-smoothie-recipe-t215841"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_coverImage__L6GCV" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-860x430,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-860x430,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-920x460,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-920x460,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-720x360,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-720x360,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-600x300,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-600x300,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-600x300,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg" alt="Workout Recovery Smoothie"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="styles_byline__zDQzc"&gt;Mitch Mandel / Smoothies &amp;amp; Juices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-link-card styles_txtWrapper__3rsLX" data-testid="article-card-text"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_author__l7Srn" data-testid="article-card-author"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;(Photo by Basicdog on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects &lt;a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/mental-health/national-study-mental-health-and-wellbeing/2020-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in five Australian men&lt;/a&gt; at some point in their lives. But the condition remains highly stigmatized, misunderstood and underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Men are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3135672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around half as likely&lt;/a&gt; to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder compared to women. Some feel pressure to be fearless and hide their emotions. Others simply don’t understand or have the language to describe anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has serious consequences. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725007591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Our latest research&lt;/a&gt; shows young men are turning to ambulance services when their symptoms become overwhelming – some even think they’re having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why do so many men wait until they need to call emergency services, rather than seek support earlier from a doctor or psychologist? And what prompts them to call? We reviewed the paramedic notes of 694 men aged 15 to 25 years in Victoria, Australia, to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-young-men-haven-t-seen-others-asking-for-help"&gt;Young Men Haven’t Seen Others Asking For Help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boys are raised to value courage, strength and self-assurance, and to suppress vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When parents encourage boys to “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735809000671?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;face their fears&lt;/a&gt;,” rather than offering emotional comfort and tenderness, anxiety gets positioned in conflict &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/masculinity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with masculinity&lt;/a&gt;. This leads to a disjuncture between the support young men are met with (and come to expect) from others, and the support they may want or need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This also means boys grow up believing their male role models – dads, brothers, grandads, coaches – don’t get anxious, deterring boys and men from seeking help. As a result, anxiety goes undiagnosed and opportunities for early intervention are missed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, we have seen positive shifts challenging restrictive masculine stereotypes. This has improved awareness surrounding &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/depression-fathers-children-genetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;men’s depression&lt;/a&gt; – opening up conversations, normalizing help-seeking and leading to the development of &lt;a href="https://headsupguys.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;men’s mental health programs and resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, men’s anxiety remains in the shadows. When anxiety is talked about, it’s not with the same weight or concern as depression. This is despite men’s anxiety having harmful &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15516548/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health impacts&lt;/a&gt; including turning to alcohol and drugs to cope, and increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access-pdfs/gender-differences-in-suicidal-risk-factors-among-individuals-with-mood-disorders-2167-1044-1000218.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;male suicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-anxiety-look-like"&gt;What Does Anxiety Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When men are encouraged to talk about anxiety, they describe various challenges including repetitive worries, feeling out-of-control and intense physical symptoms. This includes a high heart rate, shortness of breath, body pains, tremors and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/headaches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;headaches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jack Steele, a prominent Australian personality and one half of the &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/theinspiredunemployed/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Inspired Unemployed&lt;/a&gt;, opened up about his anxiety difficulties on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxAx0kOOAo8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Imperfects Podcast&lt;/a&gt; last year saying:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what anxiety was. I thought I was the opposite of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way I explain it, it’s like […] your whole body just shuts down. My throat starts closing up and my whole body just goes numb. […] It feels like you’re just so alone. You feel like no-one can help you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You genuinely think the world’s ending – like there’s no out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;







&lt;p&gt;These physical symptoms are common in men but can be frequently dismissed rather than recognized as anxiety. Our research has found that, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.13641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;when left unaddressed&lt;/a&gt;, these symptoms typically worsen and arise in more and more contexts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-anxious-men-call-ambulances"&gt;Why Do Anxious Men Call Ambulances?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725007591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Our new study&lt;/a&gt; investigated the consequences of men’s anxiety going unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, we used data from the &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Ambulance Surveillance System&lt;/a&gt; to identify and describe the types of anxiety young men experience. We then looked at the characteristics and contexts of young men’s anxiety presentations to ambulance services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed and lacking support, many young men turn to ambulances in crisis. Anxiety now accounts for &lt;a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/turning-point-website-prod/drupal-s3fs/s3fs-public/inline-files/Beyond%20the%20emergency%20WEB_FINAL_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;10% of male ambulance attendances&lt;/a&gt; for mental health concerns, surpassing depression and psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While every presentation is different, our study identified three common presentations among young men:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sudden onset of intense bodily symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; resembling life-threatening physical health conditions such as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Joshua, for example, whose case files we reviewed as part of our study, was on a tram home from work when he experienced sudden numbness in his hands and feet. A bystander saw he was having muscle spasms in his hands. Joshua was alert but extremely anxious and asked the bystander for help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Severe anxiety triggered or worsened by substance use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam, a 21-year-old man, consumed a substantial amount of diazepam (&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/safest-way-to-take-valium-ativan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valium&lt;/a&gt;) while driving home, after having an anxiety attack at work. Adam reached out to paramedics because he was concerned his anxiety symptoms hadn’t dissipated, and was worried he may have taken too much diazepam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mental health deterioration with self-harm or suicidal thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;, often tied to situational stressors such as unstable housing, unemployment, financial difficulties and relationship strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo, aged 25, had been increasingly anxious for the past three days. Leo’s parents called an ambulance after he told them he wanted to kill himself. Leo told paramedics on arrival that he still felt suicidal and had been getting worse over the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-directing-resources-where-they-re-needed"&gt;Directing Resources Where They’re Needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Young men’s anxiety presentations are time- and resource-intensive for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30543663/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom feel poorly equipped to respond effectively. After ruling out physical causes, paramedic support is typically limited to reassurance and breathing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most young men are then instructed to follow up with GPs, psychologists or other health professionals in the general community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But taking that next step involves overcoming the stigma associated with help-seeking, the shame of having called an ambulance and deep tensions between anxiety and what it means to be a man.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means many young men slip through the cracks. And without ongoing mental health support, they face high risks of presenting again to emergency services with increasingly severe &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this, we need to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ramp up conversations about men’s anxiety and take their experiences seriously&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;develop an awareness campaign about men’s anxiety. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l8GOz4a9WA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Awareness campaigns&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/39/4/daae104/7748055?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;successfully&lt;/a&gt; dismantled stigma and shed light on men’s depression and suicide&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;improve diagnosis of men’s anxiety disorders by up-skilling and &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2024-28138-001.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; clinicians to detect anxiety and the unique and distinct constellations of symptoms in men&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;create accessible pathways to early support through digital psychological education resources, focused on improving awareness and literacy surrounding men’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety experiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Among these, Aspergillus—a common yet potentially deadly fungus—is gaining new ground. Once confined primarily to warmer regions, this airborne threat is now forecasted to expand its reach into parts of North America, Europe, China, and Russia. A recent study by researchers at the University of Manchester employed advanced climate modeling to predict how Aspergillus will migrate in response to rising temperatures, warning that millions more people may be at risk of infection by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Aspergillus is a familiar organism to scientists and farmers, its ability to cause invasive aspergillosis—a severe lung infection—makes it a serious public health concern. The new findings arrive amid a global rise in fungal infections, which already claim an estimated 2.5 million lives annually. These numbers may be underreported due to the difficulty in diagnosis and the limited global surveillance of fungal diseases. This article explores the science behind Aspergillus, the impact of climate change on its distribution, and the urgent need for enhanced monitoring and medical preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Aspergillus? Understanding the fungus among us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus is a genus of over 300 mold species that thrive in various environments—soil, plant matter, decaying leaves, compost, and even indoor dust. Although many species are harmless and some are even useful in industrial fermentation (like soy sauce or citric acid production), several are pathogenic to humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most concerning are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/strong&gt;: The most common cause of aspergillosis, particularly dangerous for immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/strong&gt;: Known for producing aflatoxins, potent carcinogens that contaminate crops like maize and peanuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/strong&gt;: Common in indoor environments and capable of causing ear infections and respiratory issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fungi reproduce by releasing microscopic spores (conidia) into the air. While healthy individuals can inhale these spores with little consequence, vulnerable populations—including those with asthma, COPD, cancer, organ transplants, or HIV—face a much higher risk of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Aspergillosis explained: The deadly lung infection you’ve probably never heard of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillosis refers to a group of diseases caused by Aspergillus spores that take root in the lungs and sometimes spread to other parts of the body. The most severe form, invasive aspergillosis, can be fatal if not treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Types of Aspergillosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: A hypersensitive reaction often seen in asthma or cystic fibrosis patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: Long-term infection leading to lung cavities and respiratory decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasive aspergillosis&lt;/strong&gt;: A fast-spreading, often deadly condition in immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptoms include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes aspergillosis particularly dangerous is the difficulty in diagnosis. Its symptoms often mimic other respiratory illnesses, delaying appropriate treatment. Moreover, treatment options are limited, with only four primary classes of antifungal drugs available—azole resistance among Aspergillus species is growing, making infections harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How climate change is driving the spread of Aspergillus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Manchester study underscores a chilling reality: as global temperatures climb, so does the habitat range of heat-tolerant fungi. Using a combination of climate simulation models and fungal biology data, researchers evaluated how Aspergillus species will respond to two climate scenarios—moderate emissions and high fossil fuel use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key findings:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspergillus flavus, a heat-loving fungus, is projected to expand its global range by 16% under high-emission scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus, traditionally found in temperate regions, may shift its range northward, with a 77.5% increase in its potential habitat by 2100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This expansion could put 9 million more people in Europe at increased risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooler regions such as northern China, Russia, and parts of Canada could soon become hotspots for fungal colonization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conversely, sub-Saharan Africa, already experiencing extreme temperatures, might become too hot for certain Aspergillus strains, leading to unexpected shifts in ecological balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why heat makes fungi stronger&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi generally struggle to thrive at the high internal temperatures of mammals. However, as average global temperatures rise, fungi are slowly adapting to heat stress. This means they are more likely to survive—and flourish—inside the human body. This heat-hardening process could lead to the emergence of new, more virulent fungal strains capable of overcoming our natural defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to temperature changes, climate-linked weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods play a critical role in dispersing fungal spores. The 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri, for example, led to a rare and deadly fungal outbreak. As these extreme weather events become more frequent, the spread of Aspergillus spores across long distances will likely increase, enhancing their potential to infect new populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Public health implications: Who is at risk?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populations most vulnerable to the threat of Aspergillus expansion include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., cancer, HIV, or transplant patients)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elderly populations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with respiratory conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or COPD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rural populations with increased exposure to airborne spores from agriculture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regions projected to become new habitats for Aspergillus, public health systems may not be adequately prepared to diagnose or treat fungal diseases. There’s an urgent need for greater awareness, improved diagnostic tools, and antifungal research funding to meet this looming threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Medical challenges: Drug resistance and diagnostic gaps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most alarming aspects of the fungal threat is growing antifungal resistance. Azoles, the most commonly used antifungal drugs, are becoming less effective due to overuse in both medicine and agriculture. Some Aspergillus strains now exhibit multi-drug resistance, rendering current treatments ineffective and complicating recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further compounding the crisis is the lack of rapid diagnostic tests. In many healthcare settings, fungal infections are misdiagnosed or only detected at advanced stages. Unlike bacteria or viruses, fungal pathogens are harder to culture and require specialized labs to identify accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 12:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAJBVV95cUxNR3Q2ekVUWjZ3R1ZubkVCQU01RGh1VmVQbkMwbGJtRVJuRzlvR2YtZ29aSEVabHBLVmowRDJrWUhGNlhJRW8wYmhRMlBCRHdIbnh3MWtHUy1pVVdOcFdlYjZRQU93Y0Jsb1d5eFRVQlY0MF9VMXBqTFBvcEhualJoNmZkRTQ1MGlYM3g2T0JaeDBpREFzZHZOM3kxbi1iT1dDcFJzUm9jMjg1RWZHQ1laSkpsdHJZU2l6N2otSmN1OEpsdnJYSGpJY1NkbTdmQXBhV211NjlLYzVOWnh5NXZmenZYS21jRXYwVzUzRms4eHhaY2M1MF9CZ3YxR284MUhGT0o0c05oWkvSAY4CQVVfeXFMT3hXbHFEMThpa2x0VEUzc05rWEJObUdhZk5ic0ZrR1F3cmRoVFZjd2dJRng0TExyX2NWRTRxUkRtZFltWDhTUFM2XzliRGdmV1NLRk9TNG9CVnN5Yll2U3Bmc1Z3dGh6NGRRX19UWElxUGZwd1ZrVW5lS0NrdFpJYk1BZlc2aUd2dUZib3ZxYVZ4ck1xeXF6RERpcXlBS29LU0tibWE1UFlYbUU0Qzg0al9sRldTelNkMk5oUnZSaDNZMmNza1pYU3VxRWtjOGM5b0ZvTWxMVGY5UGFrZ2JYeF9LOEVBV1pNX2FNWUFiNFhld3NWd1JId0tZU0pLNnFYWDJkdHdqQUxxOTkyTlpn</guid></item><item><title>杏仁核塑造歌唱幼鸟的社会选择-神经科学新闻 | Amygdala Shapes Social Choices in Song-Learning Young Birds - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE1oNDJpVG9hWDJ6TU9mS2x0Rmw0MW8zQkJRU28zbkE5MXJ3ZDNKNjZjMHk3ZVZUU3BremNqTnVJOUJuLWVxMXU2c2hWSFMtNWRhQ0ZLQ1JRbHNJYk96OWkyalZFQ2JKMm1kMFhmcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Young zebra finches learn their birdsong by observing and imitating adult “tutor” birds, but they don’t follow just anyone. A new study shows that juvenile finches prefer tutors who sing longer but less often, suggesting social cues guide their choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers removed the amygdala, a brain region tied to emotion, the young birds still imitated songs, but chose tutors more randomly. This indicates that while the amygdala isn’t essential for song learning itself, it helps young birds selectively choose whom to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tutor Preference:&lt;/strong&gt; Juvenile finches favor adult tutors who sing longer but less frequently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amygdala Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing the amygdala didn’t affect imitation but reduced social selectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The amygdala may influence imitative behavior by guiding social attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does a bird learn its birdsong? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomoko Fujii and Masashi Tanaka, from Waseda University, explored what drives a zebra finch to approach and imitate other zebra finches to learn its birdsong in a new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110412"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince.jpg" alt="This shows birds and musical notes." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To examine the role of the amygdala, the researchers removed it from the young zebra finches. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored song learning in young male zebra finches as they interacted with “tutor” adults that already knew their birdsongs. Young zebra finches preferably approached tutors that sang longer but less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fujii and Tanaka next probed the role of a brain region traditionally linked to emotions in mammals (the amygdala) in this song-learning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the role of the amygdala, the researchers removed it from the young zebra finches. While loss of this brain region did not hinder song imitation, tutor selection became more unpredictable as birds pursued tutors less discerningly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing neural connections in the zebra finch brain further confirmed that the amygdala doesn’t necessarily drive song control and learning, but may play a role in socially selective, imitative behavior, according to the authors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social learning and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a070f0e030b2a190c044405180d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2435-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Amygdala Regulates Social Motivation for Selective Vocal Imitation in Zebra Finches&lt;/a&gt;” by Tomoko Fujii et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amygdala Regulates Social Motivation for Selective Vocal Imitation in Zebra Finches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imitation plays a key role in the acquisition of speech and cultural behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that social interaction facilitates imitative learning, indicating that neural circuits involved in social behaviors can also influence the process of imitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vocal imitation in juvenile songbirds serves as a valuable model to investigate this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we explore the mechanisms of tutor-pupil social interaction and selective song learning in male zebra finches, with a particular focus on the amygdala, which can regulate social behaviors via its processing of values and emotions in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sequentially exposed to two tutors, normal pupils selectively learned song from the tutor who sang longer but less frequently. When hearing songs, pupils preferentially approached the selected tutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala increased pupils’ social motivation toward tutors yet diminished their song-responsive approach, especially to the selected tutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas the pupils with amygdala lesions retained their ability to imitate song, the tutor selection became more unpredictable with diminished preference for a specific tutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuronal tracing confirmed that the zebra finch amygdala is connected to the circuits involved in social functions but lacks direct connections to those critical for song control and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that the amygdala regulates social motivation and tutor selection in juvenile zebra finches, highlighting its role in imitative learning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 12:32:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1oNDJpVG9hWDJ6TU9mS2x0Rmw0MW8zQkJRU28zbkE5MXJ3ZDNKNjZjMHk3ZVZUU3BremNqTnVJOUJuLWVxMXU2c2hWSFMtNWRhQ0ZLQ1JRbHNJYk96OWkyalZFQ2JKMm1kMFhmcg</guid></item><item><title>睡前性活动改善客观睡眠质量，研究发现- PsyPost | Sexual activity before bed improves objective sleep quality, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTHJDWGN5SDJyWDQ3eWpuVWUzclY3QU5yTVg4Q3VBWjI1WVpEMW4tMGhhM3JjTEhpdUtUME5rb2R4WG0yM0RDUGt0ZzI1S0JPeVlucWg5MWFmZk1sWGpEeld1NXg2Vml4a1BMR01Vc0cxWVh3TF80YU5mN3VnOFlncDhURHRLZmxPczZGbERFb2ZXRXhOMUszWERXY2M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in sexual activity—whether solo or with a partner—can lead to better sleep, according to a new pilot study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2024.11.004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The research found that both partnered sex and solo masturbation reduced the amount of time people spent awake during the night and improved overall sleep efficiency. These effects were not reflected in subjective reports of sleep quality, but objective sleep monitoring showed consistent improvements following sexual activity compared to nights without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people believe that orgasm has a relaxing effect and promotes sleep, most existing evidence has relied on subjective reports. Only one study—conducted more than three decades ago—had attempted to objectively measure sleep following sexual activity, and it had significant design limitations. The present research aimed to address this gap by using a portable brain-monitoring device to measure sleep stages and sleep quality in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been investigating sleep behaviors in the adult population for several years, while this has predominantly focused on improving the sleep behaviors of elite athletes, I am always asked various questions about sleep,” said study author Michele Lastella, a senior lecturer at CQUniversity Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A frequent question asked ‘how come my partner falls asleep straight away after sex and I can’t’ and I thought if people are frequently asking me questions about this, then this must be indicative that there is a real lack of research evidence around it. One of the main reasons it hadn’t previously been explored in depth was related to the taboo associated with people being afraid to talk about sex. When people would ask question, a lot of the time it was associated with the males falling asleep and the women weren’t, and I thought this may be something related to the orgasm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is part of a broader research effort investigating the relationship between sex and sleep. Earlier work Lastella and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00033" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surveyed 778 people and found&lt;/a&gt; that both men and women perceived that sex with orgasm helped them fall asleep faster and sleep better. These findings prompted the current study, which provides a more detailed and objective look at how sexual activity influences sleep physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited seven heterosexual couples, comprising 14 participants in total, all of whom were healthy, sexually active, and living together in South Australia. Participants were screened to ensure they had no sleep disorders, were not pregnant, and did not have children, which could affect sleep routines. All participants reported engaging in sexual activity at least twice a week. The final sample consisted of 7 males and 7 females, each around 26 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were monitored over 11 consecutive nights using a repeated-measures, crossover design. Each couple completed nights in three different conditions: no sexual activity, solo masturbation (with orgasm), and partnered sex (with orgasm). To measure sleep objectively, participants wore a wireless polysomnographic device (DREEM3 headband), which recorded brain activity, movement, and breathing during the night. Participants also completed self-report diaries each morning, detailing their sexual activity, sleep quality, mood, and readiness for the upcoming day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On nights when participants engaged in sexual activity, they went to bed later than on nights with no sex. However, they also spent significantly less time awake after falling asleep and had higher sleep efficiency, meaning they spent a greater proportion of their time in bed actually sleeping. Sleep efficiency was 93.2% following solo masturbation and 93.4% after partnered sex, compared to 91.5% on nights with no sexual activity. Participants spent about 7 minutes less awake during the night following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the improvements in sleep were evident only in the objective data. Participants did not report significant differences in how well they thought they had slept across the three conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that engaging in sexual activity regardless of whether it was solo masturbation or partnered sexual activity, improved objective sleep quality by reducing the amount of time spent awake throughout the night and improved overall sleep efficiency,” Lastella told PsyPost. “There were no differences in sleep duration, sleep latency and subjective sleep measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they did report feeling more motivated and ready for the day following partnered sex. On average, participants rated their motivation and readiness 8–11 points higher (on a 100-point scale) after a night of partnered sex compared to nights without sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect the study examined was how sexual activity might influence the synchronization of sleep stages between partners, known as sleep stage concordance. Previous studies have shown that couples who share a bed tend to enter REM sleep at similar times, suggesting that cosleeping can influence sleep patterns. This study found that REM sleep stage concordance was significantly longer when couples slept together—regardless of whether they had engaged in sex—compared to when they slept alone. This suggests that the act of cosleeping itself may promote synchronized REM sleep, potentially due to shared environmental and physiological cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific sleep stages, the researchers found that participants spent more time in the lightest stage of sleep (N1) on nights without sexual activity. While the difference—about 2 minutes—was statistically significant, it is unlikely to have clinical significance. Other stages of sleep, including deep sleep (N3) and REM sleep, did not show significant differences across the three conditions, although there were trends suggesting some improvements following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous research. For example, a 2023 study published in the Journal of Sleep Research used a 14-day diary method and found that partnered sex with &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/partnered-sexual-activity-with-orgasm-improves-sleep-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;orgasm was associated with shorter time to fall asleep&lt;/a&gt; and better self-reported sleep quality. However, that study did not include objective sleep measures and found inconsistent results for solo masturbation. The current study supports the idea that orgasm, regardless of whether it occurs alone or with a partner, may have sleep-promoting effects—but these effects are more clearly captured through objective measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors suggest that hormonal changes following orgasm could explain the observed benefits to sleep. Orgasm is known to increase the release of oxytocin and prolactin while reducing cortisol levels. Oxytocin, often called the “bonding hormone,” has been linked to lower stress and better sleep, while prolactin is associated with sexual satisfaction and relaxation. These hormonal shifts may reduce arousal and promote a smoother transition into restful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study had several limitations. The sample was small, consisting of only 14 participants, all of whom were healthy heterosexual couples. This limits the ability to generalize the findings to broader populations, such as older adults, people with sleep disorders, or those in non-heterosexual relationships. The participants also had to activate their sleep monitoring devices after sexual activity, which may have interfered with the natural transition into sleep and reduced the chance of capturing very short sleep onset latencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the main challenges is setting up the device to record following sexual activity, as in an ideal real world scenario individuals would be able to simply attempt to sleep following sexual activity without having to activate/record on a device,” Lastella noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was the potential for social desirability bias in self-reported measures. While the objective data were less susceptible to this, participants might have felt inclined to rate their sleep or sexual experiences more positively. The researchers note that future studies should aim to include a more diverse and larger sample and should explore whether sexual activity could be used as a behavioral intervention for people with poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are actively seeking funding to support our third part of the investigation recruiting a larger sample with participants with poor sleep quality or behaviours and examine if sexual activity can help subsequent sleep behavior,” Lastella said. “This type of research is important as it provide us with a non-pharmaceutical approach toward improving not only sleep behavior but health and wellbeing as a collective. Please reach out if this research interests you, and there are funding opportunities that might support this type of research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2024.11.004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sleep on it: A pilot study exploring the impact of sexual activity on sleep outcomes in cohabiting couples&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Michele Lastella, Dean J.

On any given day, there’s coverage of a&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-05-approach-aggressive-breast-cancers-significant.html"&gt; new treatment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27pdz4g23o"&gt;screening method&lt;/a&gt;, or a rousing story of an &lt;a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/major-league-baseball-celebrates-mother-s-day-2025"&gt;athlete’s awareness efforts&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://people.com/katie-thurston-doing-the-best-i-can-amid-breast-cancer-exclusive-11734603"&gt;celebrity fighting bravely&lt;/a&gt;. But last fall, a breast-cancer narrative of a different ilk briefly claimed headlines: In the span of six weeks, two famous breast-cancer patients shared publicly that they had declined parts of their doctors’ treatment recommendations and chosen alternative approaches instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nj001c3b6dnr6ncu8l@published" data-word-count="182"&gt;One was former MTV VJ &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/new-york-it-girl-history.html"&gt;Ananda Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58bOXgeOnFA"&gt;CNN roundtable discussion&lt;/a&gt;, she said her stage-three breast cancer diagnosed in January 2019 had progressed to stage four, which meant it was now incurable. Lewis said she had declined a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and had opted instead for lifestyle changes like detoxes and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in combination with high-dose vitamin C IVs — at least at first. “I decided to keep my tumor and try to work it out of my body a different way,” she said to CNN correspondent Stephanie Elam. The other was model Elle Macpherson. In a September interview with an &lt;a href="https://www.womensweekly.com.au/news/elle-macpherson-now/"&gt;Australian women’s magazine&lt;/a&gt;, she said she’d been diagnosed with stage-zero breast cancer and was now in remission. Though she had a lumpectomy, she &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/elle-macpherson-breast-cancer-treatment.html"&gt;refused additional therapies&lt;/a&gt;, including chemotherapy and radiation, that her doctors recommended. “I chose a holistic approach,” she wrote in her memoir, &lt;em&gt;elle&lt;/em&gt;, published in November. “Saying no to standard medical solutions was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But saying no to my own inner sense would have been even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9m0000m3b6djyrkng5l@published" data-word-count="15"&gt;Their stories are far from the norm, but they still speak to a broader trend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9m8000n3b6dfqjbmmz5@published" data-word-count="204"&gt;Scientific advancements in breast-cancer treatment occur with remarkable regularity. From 2010 to 2020, the FDA approved 30 medications for breast cancer, and in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2813878"&gt;a 2024 &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on breast-cancer mortality, the authors estimate that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a new trial in breast cancer is added to ClinicalTrials.gov every day. These developments have saved at least half a million lives. From 1989 to 2022, the breast-cancer death rate &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21863"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; by 44 percent. Currently, the overall five-year &lt;a href="https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-facts/"&gt;survival rate&lt;/a&gt; for breast cancer is 91 percent, and those diagnosed with the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5833304/"&gt;most severe form&lt;/a&gt; of the disease are living longer than ever before. And yet, despite all of this, not every breast-cancer patient opts for the most effective treatment modalities. This may be because breast-cancer care has become more varied and multipronged at a time when information — and misinformation — has never been more accessible, and when distrust in physicians is rapidly increasing, especially among Republicans. Thirty-four percent of them told &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/15/americans-trust-in-scientists-other-groups-declines/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; in the winter of 2022 they had “not too much” or “no confidence at all” that medical scientists were working toward the public’s best interests. That figure has tripled since January 2019. In other words: Why trust a doctor when you can fact-check them instead?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mz000w3b6dmg9rc325@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;“People can come to these conversations with preconceived notions about the effectiveness of these treatments and whether they should do them,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/skyler-b-johnson"&gt;Skyler Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute. “I get the sense that they feel like they know more than me, that I’m more of an enemy than a counterpart trying to help.” Some, particularly those interested in natural healing methods, are wary of conventional therapies — especially chemotherapy and radiation — and their brutal reputation. (There is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29237009/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/15/cancer-radiation-therapy-decreased-use/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that use of both therapies is declining, though chemotherapy is still &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/treatment/breast_cancer"&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; in more than half of breast-cancer patients whose disease has spread to the lymph nodes.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mn000q3b6dqebzbaos@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;For more than ten years, Johnson has &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/alternative-medicine-cancer-survival"&gt;studied&lt;/a&gt; people who forgo conventional cancer treatments in favor of unproven treatments. In one of his studies, the breast-cancer patients who made such a decision had a 470 percent increased risk of death in the following five years. He’s hesitant, at first, to say what’s changed in the decade since he began this line of research; social media was around a decade ago, after all. “But I can tell you that the patient behavior has changed,” he said, referring to worsening distrust in doctors and in the health-care system at large. “And I think it’s changed in a way that is likely going to lead to the adoption of more unproven cancer treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class="divider-border"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ni001b3b6d67b2xngx@published" data-word-count="158"&gt;Today, close to half of Americans have used alternative medicine, ranging from herbal remedies to chiropractic and acupuncture. In 2017, about 20 percent told &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2017/02/02/americans-health-care-behaviors-and-use-of-conventional-and-alternative-medicine/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; that they’d turned to alternative methods instead of conventional medical care. The practice is especially popular in cancer care. An estimated 50 percent of cancer patients use alternative medicine in addition to conventional treatment. It’s harder to pinpoint how many people may be using alternative care &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of standard care, in part because these patients may not be in contact with the health-care system. But, anecdotally, stories about celebrities choosing this route seems to have an impact on the larger patient population. &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mel-gibson-joe-rogan-ivermectin-fenbendazole-cancer-podcast-2013180"&gt;In January,&lt;/a&gt; Mel Gibson went on Joe Rogan’s podcast and said three of his friends had been cured of their stage-four cancers after taking ivermectin and fenbendazole (an anti-parasitic). Since then, Johnson said, “This is not an exaggeration: I am fielding a question about ivermectin currently once a week.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mt000v3b6diabxhn41@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;Personal stories and recommendations wield power too. When Amber Jones, who is in her early 40s and lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed with breast cancer, a friend told her to look up Josh Axe, a practitioner of natural medicine and chiropractic. Axe &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJJ_Q0luTaT/"&gt;often shares&lt;/a&gt; his mother’s cancer-recovery story, which he attributes to natural healing methods. “He’s the reason,” Jones said. “He’s the reason I had the courage to do what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9s8001w3b6dmmyzjm7j@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;In 2022, when she was 38, she had an abnormal Pap smear that turned out to be cervical cancer. Her doctors recommended a radical &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/why-lena-dunhams-hysterectomy-is-unusual.html"&gt;hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt;, which would remove nearly all of her reproductive organs (her surgeon would leave one ovary, so as not to send her into early menopause) as well as the surrounding tissue. She was terrified of the diagnosis and complied without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n0000y3b6d7zph3tbk@published" data-word-count="26"&gt;“It all happened so fast,” said Jones. “And then you get through the other side … and you just realize, &lt;em&gt;Holy shit, I just had cancer.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nn001e3b6dsef7uo68@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;The surgery was a success: Follow-up tests showed no sign of cancer. But it left her reeling. Recovery was difficult, and it took her six months to feel physically functional again. The emotional impact lingered even longer. “You hear the word cancer the first time, and you think, &lt;em&gt;I’m going to die&lt;/em&gt;,” she said. Within a day of her diagnosis, she started organizing her finances, going so far as to make her teenage daughter the beneficiary of her bank account. “It was just really, really emotionally traumatizing,” she said. “And that feeling didn’t go away.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ms000t3b6dy93lst0s@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;She decided to make some lifestyle changes. She made her own deodorant and planted an organic garden in her backyard. (It has required getting creative when it comes to controlling bugs: “There’s some particular bugs that you just have to hand-pick off,” she said.) She began to drink reverse-osmosis-filtered water, eat grass-fed meats from regeneratively raised farms, and take methylated vitamins. “I fired my cleaning people and was like, &lt;em&gt;I’m doing this myself, old school — baking soda, vinegar&lt;/em&gt;,” she said. “I stopped &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-dye-your-hair.html"&gt;dyeing my hair&lt;/a&gt; and going to salons. I stopped doing my nails.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nw001f3b6diif04rzg@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;And then, after all that, in 2024, Jones received a second cancer diagnosis. She had triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease that grows and spreads more quickly than other types. She was 40 years old now, with a husband and two teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mt000u3b6dmyh8d1io@published" data-word-count="9"&gt;This time, she wanted her treatment to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ml000p3b6di5wyducz@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;The cancer was stage one, which meant it was still &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/triple-negative-breast-cancer-5-things-you-should-know.h00-158986656.html"&gt;curable&lt;/a&gt;, and her medical team recommended surgery to remove the tumor, plus chemotherapy and radiation to lessen the chance of recurrence. But Jones didn’t want to do any of that. She’d just worked so hard to build her body back up after the hysterectomy. To her, the thought of another surgery, plus chemo and radiation, meant potentially undoing it all. “I just believed boosting my body and my immune system would serve me better,” she said. She expressed her hesitancy toward the suggested treatments at her first appointment with her medical oncologist, who was alarmed. But Jones dug in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n200123b6d0kg81dck@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;“Because that was the mistake I made with my first cancer,” she said. “I probably should have fought a little bit harder for myself and not done what I was told to.” Soon after her second diagnosis, Jones began to follow a few alternative-wellness influencers, including Axe and &lt;a href="https://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/about/"&gt;Chris Wark&lt;/a&gt;, who declined chemotherapy after surgery for stage-3C colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ou001m3b6dv2xnmzrz@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;Despite her initial hesitation about the surgery, Jones eventually relented on it; getting the cancer out of her body felt like the right thing to do. Afterward, her pathology report showed no sign of disease. “There was not one cancer cell,” she said. “Everything was clear.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9q7001q3b6d0cgi0k8e@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;A week later, Jones again met with her oncologist via telehealth and expressed her relief at the outcome, assuming it would mean no need for chemotherapy and radiation. Actually, her oncologist said, she did still need both to reduce the risk of recurrence. Jones couldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mq000s3b6dtjgucu10@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;“I was like, &lt;em&gt;Excuse me? Are you crazy?&lt;/em&gt;” she said. “Like, why are you going to blast my body and destroy my immune system?” If the cancer did return — and at the time, Jones was confident that it wouldn’t — she reasoned that she would need a healthy immune system to fight it. Chemotherapy can be &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/immune-system/cancer-treatments/chemotherapy"&gt;especially destructive&lt;/a&gt; to white blood cells, which can make patients more vulnerable to disease and infection. “Why would you subject me to that if I don’t need it? How do you know I need it?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mp000r3b6d24gko83w@published" data-word-count="16"&gt;Jones ended the call. That appointment was last summer, and she hasn’t seen her oncologist since.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it is still &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy/when-is-it-needed"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for those with breast cancer that is at a higher risk of recurring or spreading. Side effects are common, though their severity &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/chemotherapy/chemotherapy-side-effects.html"&gt;varies&lt;/a&gt; from person to person. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10226821/#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%2097.4%20%25%20(,%25%20(n=25)."&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 97 percent of patients reported at least one side effect; fatigue was most commonly reported, followed by loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n100103b6damvqxf0v@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;Sarah Reandeau experienced nearly all of those after getting diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, stage 2B. At first, Reandeau stayed on the treatment course recommended by her doctor, even though it was rough. “We did numerous different types of chemotherapy, because I kept having allergic reactions,” she said. “I would get the chemo, and then I would have reactions to it, and then they would have to pump me full of steroids to stop the reactions from happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9w1001x3b6dgbpobfpy@published" data-word-count="135"&gt;Without informing her doctor, she had concurrently begun taking a variety of natural remedies, many of which she discovered on TikTok. Every day, she consumed soursop tea, apricot kernels, turkey-tail mushroom tablets, and muscadine-juice concentrate to treat her cancer, even though her medical team had told her not to take supplements because they could worsen the side effects or weaken the efficacy of the chemo. (Johnson estimates that one in three patients who use unproven treatments don’t inform their medical team.) “They say you can eat and drink and do whatever you want, but don’t take any supplements,” she said. “Like, you can eat hot dogs, hamburgers, you can have as much ice cream as you want. But don’t take soursop. And I’m like, &lt;em&gt;Well, that doesn’t really seem to make a lot of sense&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

Like usual, her mom took her home afterward, where Reandeau lived alone. “And everything seemed normal,” she said. “And then about a week went by, and I don’t remember pretty much the entire week.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ng001a3b6ddn6oodjr@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;She knows she threw up a lot, and she knows she lost control of her bowels. Once, she woke up in the bathroom at two or three in the morning, with no memory of how she got there, and found herself surrounded by her own vomit and feces. Her sister took her back to the oncologist, who said she was neutropenic. She was too out of it to know what drugs she received as treatment (“steroids and liquids and all different kinds of medication”), but within a few hours, she was feeling better. Her doctors suggested lessening the chemotherapy dosage, but she had already made up her mind. She would have surgery and rounds of radiation, but she was steadfast in her chemo decision.&lt;/p&gt;

It is treatable, and we have a lot of treatments that can work for a very long time.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n200133b6d74ulaidz@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;Citrin spent much of his career treating breast-cancer patients at a for-profit hospital chain outside of Chicago called Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Eventually, the hospital was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/08/city-of-hope-to-buy-cancer-treatment-centers-of-america/"&gt;bought by another system&lt;/a&gt;, but at the time, Citrin said, it advertised a holistic approach as part of its marketing. “It was really just simply a marketing ploy, because I’m a very conventional, conservative medical oncologist. We used surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and all appropriate treatments,” he said. “But this was the hook that institution used to get people in.” (The chain faced accusations of misleading marketing claims and &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/1996/03/companies-purport-successfully-treat-cancer-agree-settle-ftc-charges-over-their-claims#:~:text=Cancer%20Treatment%20Centers%20of%20America,%2C%20based%20in%20Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma."&gt;reached a settlement&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Trade Commission over those allegations in 1996.)&lt;/p&gt;

I mean, you can’t imagine what her breast would look like.” He has seen women whose tumors grew so large they broke through the skin. One woman hid her breast cancer from her husband as long as she could, until neither of them could ignore the smell. “Her breast literally fell off in the shower, it was so diseased,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n0000z3b6dyiib3szh@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;In 2012, he published a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3360900/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; for which he interviewed 60 breast-cancer patients who had chosen alternative treatment instead of conventional therapies. The research was an attempt to identify what motivated these patients, inspired by the horrors he’d seen in his clinical practice. Many of these women told him they’d had bad experiences with “uncaring, insensitive, and unnecessarily harsh” oncologists who dismissed their wishes to incorporate alternative medicine into their treatment protocols or became combative when they asked questions. One woman reported feeling even more alienated when her doctor tried to scare her into conventional treatment, telling her, “You’ll never live to see your grandchildren born.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n400143b6d66jisk9f@published" data-word-count="128"&gt;Others said they were afraid of side effects. Very few of them declined surgery, some refused radiation, and many declined chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Almost as many also refused postsurgical treatment, called adjuvant therapy, which uses a variety of treatment modalities (such as chemotherapy and radiation) and is meant to kill off even microscopic cancer cells to lower the risk of recurrence. The side effects can make adjuvant therapy a hard sell, especially after a test comes back after surgery showing no sign of cancer. In one study, an &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2017/breast-cancer-patients-forego-post-surgery-treatment-due-to-mistrust-study-suggests"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; one-third of breast-cancer patient-study participants either quit or never started their prescribed adjuvant therapy. The study also noted that patients who are more distrustful of medical institutions are even more likely to stop treatment or fail to start.&lt;/p&gt;

So then, “&lt;em&gt;Why do I have to do this? The surgeon told me he got it all!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

Jones’s oncologist told her that with the recommended adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, her chance of the cancer returning would be 5 to 10 percent. Without the treatment, she estimated Jones’s chance of recurrence at 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s certainly not the choice her oncologist wanted her to make. But medicine in the U.S. is based on shared decision-making between patients and physicians. “It’s our job to give our best possible medical advice and the reason behind that medical advice,” said &lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jennifer_litton.html"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Litton,&lt;/a&gt; a breast cancer oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas. “But then it’s absolutely that person’s right to decide what’s best for them.”&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, Swire-Thompson collaborated with Johnson to study online claims about unproven cancer treatments and what could be done to correct them. One thing that seems to work is highlighting low expertise; pointing out, in other words, that this person doesn’t have the credentials to be sharing this information. But Swire-Thompson noted that it’s hard to beat someone’s personal story, in part because it’s difficult to identify what to correct. “When people hear an anecdote that matches some of their preconceived ideas, it’s really easy to believe in that story,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nz001h3b6db9bbvu63@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;She hasn’t studied this theory formally, and when we spoke, it wasn’t clear how she’d continue her research into cancer misinformation. In April, she received an email notifying her that she’d lost her federal funding because her project was attempting to sway public opinion. “Unlike with other misinformation topics, I don’t think there’s much nuance here,” said Swire-Thompson, who has studied misinformation and what makes people update their beliefs since 2009. “I thought there’d be at least bipartisan agreement that cancer is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;

Today, patients will often have arrived in their physicians’ office having thoroughly researched their condition and the most cutting-edge treatments. The authors suggest physicians may need to reconceptualize their role as “consultants or advisors to patients who will increasingly direct their own care.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ne00193b6dsa8xyauh@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;Citrin has a habit of dropping an incomprehensible medical term in conversation and then explaining it in the very next breath. It’s an approach that, he thinks, has helped nudge reluctant patients to consent to conventional cancer treatments. “In my experience, if a doctor takes the time to explain this to the patient in simple terms, most patients stick with it,” he said. “But unfortunately, in the current climate, doctors’ time is limited for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9rq001u3b6dnouw916j@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;Johnson said he tries to connect with patients who are skeptical. He has told those who are interested in alternative-care treatments: &lt;em&gt;Try it. But keep in touch, and let’s test again in a few months. &lt;/em&gt;“Unfortunately, physicians will often wash their hands of these people and say, &lt;em&gt;Good luck&lt;/em&gt;,” he said. “And that’s kind of the end of it.” He likes to leave the door open, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

Although she eventually received a type of alternative chemotherapy called insulin potentiation therapy, which Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center says is unproven, she stands by her surgery choice. “On some level, it would have been easier to get rid of the tumor,” she said over the phone. But a double mastectomy would have put her in a body she didn’t want to be in. “I would rather live a shorter life as me than a longer one as someone I don’t recognize,” she added. Recently, Lewis has been on conventional treatments for stage-four cancer — an oral hormone therapy called anastrozole and an injection called fulvestrant — and has received targeted radiation on her spine for pain management. She says she’s in pain right now, but she believes that’s because her body is healing. In March, Macpherson &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/elle-macpherson-on-her-celebration-phase/id1585499926?i=1000700888878"&gt;told Hoda Kotb&lt;/a&gt; that she was in clinical remission.&lt;/p&gt;

When we spoke in March, Jones had been dodging calls from her oncologist, who was trying to schedule an imaging appointment. She’s wary of the radiation, as well as the compression. (“I don’t want to radiate and squish the hell out of damaged tissue,” she said.) She’s also very worried that her cancer has spread, and that imaging only her breasts would miss that. “She keeps following up with me … to do a mammogram,” Jones said of her doctor. “And it’s like, well, what about the rest of my body?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9pa001p3b6dds506wb1@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;In February, she paid out of pocket for a whole-body MRI from a private medical testing company called &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/10/i-tried-the-viral-prenuvo-scan-review.html"&gt;Prenuvo&lt;/a&gt;, which came back all clear. She understands that the test doesn’t replace breast imaging. “But I figured it’s better than nothing,” she said. She knows her cancer might come back, and that if it does, her prognosis will be worse. And so she has decided that, in the end, she’d rather not know if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m putting in all the effort and investing in my body, you know? If it comes back, it comes back.”&lt;/p&gt;

Choose a grain base like quinoa, wild rice, millet or farro. Add protein like shrimp, beans, tofu, salmon or lentils. Choose a dairy topper like cheese, and don’t forget to add frozen, fresh or roasted vegetables. You can also add other toppings such as avocado.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crumbled tofu taco lettuce wraps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (Toby Smithson): “Serve them with a side of non-starchy vegetables like steamed green beans, and an apple, which is a quality carbohydrate, along with some with nuts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bento box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (Amy Goodson): “Use a six-compartment box to build your lunch with fruit, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, dairy and a healthy-fat dip.” Goodson loves a Mediterranean box of grapes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, quinoa, chicken, mini mozzarella balls and hummus. For a Tex-Mex box, she uses pineapple chunks, bell pepper strips, brown rice, shredded chicken, black beans, shredded cheddar and guacamole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leftovers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Rebecca Russell):&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;span&gt;One of my favorite lunch strategies is repurposing dinner leftovers. Making a little extra at dinner and enjoying it the next day saves time, reduces waste and can still give you that ideal balance of protein, healthy fat, and fiber, without needing to prep a separate meal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make lunch fun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;RD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://oldwayspt.org/inside-oldways/staff/kelly-leblanc/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kelly LeBlanc" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e09dae4b0c2f07d8c77b4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://oldwayspt.org/inside-oldways/staff/kelly-leblanc/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kelly LeBlanc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggested a return to the traditions of lunchtime from long ago. “In many traditional diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, lunch was, and still is, in many places, an important meal that people returned home for and leisurely enjoyed with their families, rather than quickly eating in a cubicle by themselves.

One of the biggest areas of research is cognitive function, given that creatine plays a role in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain-physiology/what-neurogenesis" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;neogenesis&lt;/a&gt; – the formation of new neurons in the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was assumed that the body's uptake of creatine cells is marginal, therefore it wouldn't work for only one night of sleep deprivation – until we did our study," says Gordjinejad, a research scientist at the Forschungszentrum Jülich research centre, in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250522-140200-09101d307-web-2.22.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ld1xfd.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images It's thought that creatine may help to protect unborn babies from a lack of oxygen in the womb (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;It's thought that creatine may help to protect unborn babies from a lack of oxygen in the womb (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gordjinejad found that processing speed was much faster in the creatine group compared with the placebo group. Gordjinejad doesn't know exactly why, but he suspects it's because the sleep deprivation and cognitive tasks put participants' neurons under stress, and this triggers the body to take in more creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If the energy demand is high from cells, then phosphocreatine (which provides energy for short bursts of effort) comes in and acts like an energy reservoir," says Gordjinejad, who explains that dietary creatine can help this reserve to fill up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If cells need a lot of energy for a short period of time, phosphocreatine can come in and act as an energy reserve, Gordjinejad explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Though Gordjinejad's study was small, he believes his findings show that creatine could potentially help to overcome the negative effects of sleep deprivation – but only in the short-term, until you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the participants in Gordjinejad's study took 10 times the recommended daily dose of creatine – they had 35g, which is around half a glass full of the powdered supplement. (Do not try this at home.) This dose, Gordjinejad says, would pose a risk to people with kidney problems, and in the general population it could cause stomach pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gordjinejad plans to conduct a similar trial where he gives participants a smaller dose.

If creatine levels are low, this affects energy production in the brain, but also the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/301707-creatine-supplementation-in-depression-a-review-of-mechanisms-efficacy-clinical-outcomes-and-future-directions#!/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;levels of neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; – chemical signals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other – he says.

In 2023, Ostojic and colleagues from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, tested the effects of creatine supplements in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.3597" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;19 patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers gave 4g of creatine to half the participants, and a placebo to the other half. Then they monitored their symptoms, and the levels of creatine in their brain and muscles. After six months, the team found that those who received extra creatine had improved symptoms, including less brain fog and concentration difficulties. The more severe the disease, the lower levels of creatine in their bodies had been at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The hypothesis was that the brain, under the stress of long Covid, depletes levels of creatine, which is a critical energy-supplying substance," Ostojic says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While creatine isn't a cure for long Covid, Ostojic concludes, it could provide some benefits. But there's more work to do; he wants to better understand potential gender differences at play when it comes to creatine and conditions such as long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ostojic adds that women tend to lose more creatine through their urine and have lower levels of muscle mass compared to men. Since this is where most creatine is stored, it makes sense that women would have less creatine overall. "My preliminary feeling is that women with long Covid might respond better to creatine supplementation [than men]," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;The&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="lifecycle" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="lifecycle" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;lifecycle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The cells and tissues in our bodies use creatine as an energy source at every stage of reproduction, says Stacey Ellery, an NHMRC Peter Doherty early career research fellow at Monash University Australia. This incudes sperm motility, uterine and placental development, as well as foetal growth and breastmilk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Creatine may also have an important role in reducing the damage caused by a lack of oxygen, says Ellery, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2393-14-150" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;such as to foetuses during birth&lt;/a&gt; or in the womb. A lack of oxygen can restrict the ability of cells to generate sufficient energy in crucial tissues, such as the placenta and foetal brain, which can stunt their growth or impact their long-term health, she explains. But in the very short term, creatine can allow cells to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/maple-leaf/rcaf/2020/10/track-and-field-for-masters-athletes-6-understanding-energy-systems.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;release energy without needing oxygen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A creatine supplement can boost the creatine available to cells for energy production during oxygen deprivation," says Ellery. "Consider it like charging a spare battery for a power outage.

Apart from religiously taking her metformin tablets, she did not think too much about her condition. Recently, however, constant fatigue, swollen ankles, and vision problems made her go back to her doctor. She was shocked when she was told that her blood sugar levels were too high, her haemoglobin and vitamin D levels were dangerously low, and that she was borderline obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I eat a normal diet and I do not indulge in sweets often. I do not know why my sugar is high or why I seem to be putting on weight, despite not eating much. The doctor wants me to eat more vegetables and fruits and switch from rice to ragi. But I work as a domestic help and mostly eat the food provided by my employers. Also, I cannot afford to buy fruits and vegetables on my income. Even fish has become so expensive. We also do not get pulses or legumes at subsidised rates from ration shops anymore,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sobha’s story is being played out across the country. People like her are among the millions of malnourished, obese, persons with diabetes in the country, who will, over time, develop serious complications of diabetes such as renal failure because basic lifestyle changes-- especially dietary changes -- that are required to keep non-communicable diseases (NCDs) under control are beyond their means. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Eating healthy is expensive &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a bid to ensure that people do not go hungry, the nation opted for food security, and for this calorie-dense grains and cereals are supplied at subsidised rates to people through the public distribution system. But it is the poor in the country who are now paying the price for the lack of nutritional content and dietary diversity in their food with their health. Healthy foods are expensive, and in the absence of any policy-level effort to make these accessible to the poor, the cycle of malnutrition, obesity, and NCDs will continue,” says T.S. Anish, Associate Professor of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Manjeri.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Food Policy Report 2024, ‘Food systems for healthy diets and nutrition’, released by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) last year, reported that 16.6 % of Indians suffered from malnutrition because of poor dietary habits. It said that at least 38 % of the Indian population ate unhealthy foods, while only 28 % ate all five recommended food groups, which included at least one starchy staple food, one vegetable, one fruit, one pulse, nut or seed, and one animal-source food.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another report, the United Nations’ State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report published in July last year said that 55.6% of Indians cannot afford a healthy, balanced, and diverse diet because eating healthy is a costly affair. This is however lower than the 2017 data, when the figure was 69.5 %. The report, published by five UN agencies, described a ‘healthy diet’ as comprising four key aspects: diversity (within and across food groups), adequacy (sufficiency of all essential nutrients compared to requirements), moderation (foods and nutrients that are related to poor health outcomes) and balance (energy and macronutrient intake). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Economic and gender disparities &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic and gender disparities have been fuelling India’s double burden of malnutrition -- a paradox wherein malnutrition co-exists with obesity. According to the WHO, “the double burden of malnutrition is characterised by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity, or diet-related noncommunicable diseases, within individuals, households, and populations, and across the life course.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urbanisation seems to be one of the driving factors of this double burden, as the urban lifestyle encourages the easy availability of high-fat and ultra-processed food and beverages. The situation is exacerbated by additional factors such as low levels of physical activity and sedentary lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal undernutrition compromises foetal growth and increases the risk of children who may be underweight, stunted, and micronutrient deficient. On the other hand, maternal obesity or overnutrition could lead to gestational weight gain (possibly complicated by gestational diabetes) and babies who run the risk of insulin resistance in later life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per National Family Health Survey - 5 data, under-nutrition in children is rampant -- 36% stunted, 19% wasted, 32% underweight -- while among adults, 31.7% of women and 28.6% of men in urban areas and 19% of women and 18.8% men in rural areas were obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Too many carbs, too little protein &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dietary Guidelines for Indians (DGIs) developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN), Hyderabad, and released last year, said that 56.4% of total disease burden in India could be attributed to unhealthy diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report recommended that no more than 45% of calories in the daily diet should come from cereals and millets; 15% from pulses, and beans (protein sources), and the rest should come from nuts, vegetables, fruits, and milk. But the reality of the Indian diet is that it is highly deficient in protein, with nearly 70% of the caloric requirement met through carbohydrates and the intake of micronutrient-rich vegetables, and fruits much below recommended levels.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission published recommendations about healthy diet patterns that can sustain 10 billion people in an environmentally friendly manner by 2050. In 2020, the International Food Policy Research Institute published a paper on how well the Indian dietary pattern fitted in with the EAT-Lancet reference diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that Indian households who spend the least on food show the greatest reliance on whole grains, starches, and processed foods, with little else. This pattern is maintained across the rural-urban divide. Protein makes up only 6-8% of the caloric intake, against the 30% in the reference diet. Fruits and vegetables make up about 8% of daily calories in the reference diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealthiest city dwellers get almost a third of their calories from processed foods. Even among the poorest, 8% of calories come from these foods for urban and rural residents. In South India, processed foods make up 13% of diets, vs. 8% in North-east and North India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study pointed towards “a lack of availability, accessibility, awareness, and acceptability” as other major causes for the poor quality of Indian diets and recommended that subsidies on healthy foods should be the norm. Large-scale awareness campaigns were needed to help people understand why their dietary diversity needed to improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;The need for affordable, diverse diets &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sreejith N. Kumar, a Thiruvananthapuram-based physician who has been at the forefront of Eat Right campaigns in Kerala, says that dietary diversity or the quality of one’s diet need not be a complicated affair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One just needs to follow the “MyPlate” dietary guideline (from the U.S. Department of Agriculture) which says that half of your plate be filled with fruits and vegetables, a quarter each is filled with grains and protein. This roughly falls in line with the ICMR-NIN guidelines that no more than 45% of calories come from cereals,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heavy reliance on carbs in every meal and sedentary work has led to spiralling levels of abdominal obesity in both rural and urban India. This excessive carb and fructose (from sugary, processed foods) intake is the starting point of fatty liver disease, a phenomenon that has engulfed Kerala, Dr. Sreejith says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring dietary diversity or the consumption from a wide range of food groups is key to achieving optimal nutrition and staving off micronutrient deficiencies and thus malnutrition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFHS-5 data shows that only 28% of adults consume all five recommended food groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sreejith says that the first imperative to healthy eating should be awareness of the importance of dietary diversity and a change in mindset on what needs to be on one’s plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For healthy eating to be affordable, the accent should be on encouraging people to eat vegetables and fruits which are locally and seasonally available. You do not need broccoli, spinach, and Greek yoghurt, but can opt for the innumerable varieties of leafy vegetables (amaranthus), moringa leaves, and other local vegetables (eg: banana stem and flower). Eggs are an affordable source of protein,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to prioritise vegetables, include moderate amounts of protein and fat, and lower the amount of carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;The need for healthy food policies &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kerala, local self-governments and Kudumbasree units have taken up several initiatives at the ward level to encourage household vegetable farming in grow bags so that fresh produce is available at least in a small way in every household. However, larger policy initiatives are needed to support the nutritional requirements of a huge section of the nation’s population, including the subsidised supply of healthy and diverse food options as well as the imposition of a fat tax or health tax on the sale of ultra-processed and high fatty foods to limit the consumption of these items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, Arun Gupta, paediatrician, public health expert, and convenor of the Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest, points out that weak and subjective labelling and advertising laws are letting junk food giants enjoy the freedom to make profits at the expense of public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an article in The Hindu, ‘Flawed food regulations fuel the obesity crisis’, Dr. Gupta says that the Economic Survey 2025 recommendation that a health tax be imposed on ultra-processed foods to curb their consumption is being derailed by the same “industry-friendly, subjective food marketing regulations”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“India should adopt a stringent front-of-pack marketing labelling system (to curb unrestricted advertisements of unhealthy processed foods); fix clear salt/sugar/fat limits for foods high in fat/salt and sugar and frame stringent advertising laws. Lastly, the government should consider launching a campaign on the risks of consuming ultra-processed food in all languages,” Dr. Gupta adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the State-level too, farming policies should be able to leverage local food systems which include a diverse variety of local vegetables, pulses, and millets, so that the nutritional content of diets can be improved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"&gt;&lt;p class="publish-time-new"&gt; Published &lt;span&gt;- May 27, 2025 03:03 pm IST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-block d-sm-none "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hindu</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么人工智能可能会倾听您的下一个医生预约-《华尔街日报》 | Why AI May Be Listening In on Your Next Doctor’s Appointment - WSJ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPN2JkeUlUN3Z4OUVodVd2djNDY1kzSERYLXNNUWV6Vm5kVkhlNDBEbkZPbFItblNudWxRWFp1Z1ZjekUzSnV0TjBZSF9wSHNPTklmc2F5aDFDWENVLXV0LV9xVGtmV0VsZVNnWjBCOHlkaHZKM215QXd5eHBJYk9xOVNpWFZYUXZYNmRueVdhMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSJ</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPN2JkeUlUN3Z4OUVodVd2djNDY1kzSERYLXNNUWV6Vm5kVkhlNDBEbkZPbFItblNudWxRWFp1Z1ZjekUzSnV0TjBZSF9wSHNPTklmc2F5aDFDWENVLXV0LV9xVGtmV0VsZVNnWjBCOHlkaHZKM215QXd5eHBJYk9xOVNpWFZYUXZYNmRueVdhMA</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症有传染性吗？情侣可以通过接吻分享- Earth.com | Is depression contagious?

We accept the idea that couples influence each other’s habits, moods, and routines. But what if those changes extend far beyond conscious behaviors? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if even depression could shift between partners – not just through shared struggles, but through the very bacteria in your body beginning to mirror those of your spouse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by Iranian researcher Reza Rastmanesh presents a surprising theory: depression and anxiety might be contagious among couples – not just through shared &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/young-adult-depression-linked-to-worse-memory-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional experiences&lt;/a&gt;, but through oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months of marriage, healthy spouses living with a partner suffering from both depression and insomnia began to show measurable changes in their mood, sleep, and microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oral microbiota transmission between individuals in close contact partially mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety,” noted the authors of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research, while preliminary, opens a new frontier in how we understand emotional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-related-brain-inflammation-linked-to-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt; within intimate relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marriage-might-shift-mental-health"&gt;Marriage might shift mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on couples married for under a year, recruited from two private sleep clinics in Tehran. They selected 268 couples in which one spouse exhibited the “depression-anxiety phenotype” – defined by moderate depression, moderate anxiety, and significant sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these individuals lived with a partner who was initially healthy, free from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teens-with-problematic-smartphone-use-suffer-from-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional&lt;/a&gt; and sleep disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured mental health using validated Persian versions of standard questionnaires: the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The researchers collected saliva to assess cortisol – a stress hormone – and mouth swabs to analyze bacterial composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, the healthy spouses had changed. Their depression, anxiety, and sleep scores increased, and their oral bacteria began to resemble those of their affected partner. Even more revealing, women appeared to be more vulnerable to these shifts than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couples-may-pass-on-depression"&gt;Couples may pass on depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouth-to-mouth bacterial transfer sounds unusual, but it is a daily part of close contact. Whether through kissing, sharing food, or simply breathing the same air, couples swap millions of microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, this poses no risk. But the Iranian study suggests that these exchanges may influence &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-americans-have-lost-years-of-time-to-poor-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiota of a healthy spouse started to show elevated levels of bacterial groups previously linked to mental illness. These included Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae. The researchers used advanced DNA sequencing and linear discriminant analysis to track these shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggested a microbial convergence. The oral ecosystems of the healthy partners grew more similar to those of their depressed and anxious spouses. Over time, emotional and biological states seemed to synchronize as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cortisol-rises-with-partner-s-depression"&gt;Cortisol rises with partner’s depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team measured cortisol, a hormone known to spike under stress. Cortisol can indicate how the body reacts to emotional burdens. At the start of the study, healthy partners had low levels. But after living with a troubled spouse, their cortisol levels rose dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female spouses saw particularly steep increases. In one part of the analysis, women’s cortisol nearly doubled. These hormonal changes paralleled shifts in depression and anxiety scores, reinforcing the theory that stress responses are shared on a physiological level in close relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds weight to the idea that psychological synchrony in couples may not just be behavioral – it might also have microbial and hormonal dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-certain-bacteria-might-worsen-sleep"&gt;Certain bacteria might worsen sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oral microbiome is more than just an ecosystem of bacteria. It communicates with the brain through what scientists call the oral microbiota-brain axis. Changes in this microbial network may influence neurological pathways, potentially altering mood and cognitive states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia severity in this study correlated with the presence of certain bacterial groups. Higher levels of Fusobacteria and Spirochaetota, for example, tracked closely with disrupted sleep. Healthy spouses began to show increased levels of these microbes after six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One especially interesting find was that a bacterium called Dialister – belonging to the Firmicutes family – was more abundant in women than men. This suggests that women may absorb and reflect microbial changes more intensely than their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couples-might-unknowingly-share-depression-nbsp"&gt;Couples might unknowingly share depression &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that couples synchronize in fascinating ways. They may mirror each other’s heart rates, align their sleep cycles, or even exhibit similar cortisol rhythms. This new research suggests that oral bacteria may form another point of connection, influencing depression among couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study discusses “social closeness” as a factor in microbial exchange. This refers not just to physical proximity but emotional bonds that enable deeper contact. The closer the relationship, the more likely it becomes for microbial and emotional states to influence one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why couples often seem to echo each other’s mental states over time. Depression and anxiety could ripple through households, not just via conversations and behaviors, but via silent bacterial messengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-and-bacteria-in-newlyweds"&gt;Mood and bacteria in newlyweds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted with care. The team excluded any participants taking antibiotics, pregnant women, or couples that had separated during the study period. Oral samples were collected from the palatine tonsils and throat. The DNA was extracted and sequenced using industry-standard protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants provided samples at the start and again six months later. Cortisol was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses included logistic regression, correlation testing, and microbial diversity evaluation. All procedures followed ethical guidelines set by the Iran National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these strengths, the researchers acknowledge limitations. They only collected morning saliva, didn’t account for shared dietary changes, and relied on self-reported mental health scores. Still, the trends they uncovered were consistent and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-this-change-how-we-treat-couples"&gt;Will this change how we treat couples?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One implication is clear: emotional health within a couple may be more interconnected than we realized. Traditionally, doctors treat individuals. But this study raises the possibility that treating both partners may be more effective when mental health symptoms appear in one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study references animal research that supports this view. Transferring gut bacteria from depressed mice into healthy ones produced depressive behaviors. Similarly, probiotics have improved sleep and mood in mice exposed to stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that microbial environments might trigger emotional shifts, at least under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fecal microbiota-induced insomnia and depression-like behaviors in mice can be alleviated by microbiota-modulating probiotics,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this effect translates to humans, we may need to rethink mental health therapy – not just for individuals, but for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-holistic-medicine"&gt;The future of holistic medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study hints at larger networks. The oral microbiome is linked to both the gut and ocular microbiomes. People suffering from dry eye syndrome, for example, often have depression or anxiety. These conditions may share more than emotional roots – they may share microbial ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such overlaps suggest that personalized medicine could one day include microbiome mapping. Couples might receive probiotic therapies together or undergo screenings that look at bacterial harmony in addition to emotional wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea aligns with the goals of predictive and personalized care. If bacterial shifts can predict emotional changes, then we might have a new tool for early diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-love-health-and-invisible-influence"&gt;Love, health, and invisible influence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage, as it turns out, is not just a merging of hearts. It’s also a merging of ecosystems. When one partner carries the emotional burden of depression or anxiety, the other may feel it not just psychologically, but biologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research does not suggest people should avoid relationships with depressed partners. Instead, it encourages a more compassionate and scientifically informed view of mental health. If bacterial imbalances contribute to emotional distress, then treating those imbalances could offer hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to confirm whether these effects are causal. But if they are, they could shift how we define and support emotional health – not only in individuals, but in the shared space between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, couples may influence each other in ways we’re only beginning to understand – and some of those influences might be microscopic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2472-0712/ERHM-2025-00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:01:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPazJLUFlZRktpU2poWldqN1ZYNHUybmk1QTAycGJBaUlxcFJTV01xanp5YTQ3VTU2dHZvenVacmpBeFpmOTBxbUplNGh2MlZ0TEhOSlB2RjFDaUZLNVM5MGxtamxodnl0TVA2eGNLWUQ4WW1weEd5R3BtekVQNF9SMUNBME1CUEU4V3ZfcWthLUhNMlU</guid></item><item><title>准备好进行心理重启了吗？报名参加我们的5天创意挑战赛。-《纽约时报》 | Ready for a Mental Reboot?

A secret code for a mental reboot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There is, and it’s called creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Creativity isn’t a rare gift reserved for artists. Everyone is creative in some way, whether or not they think so, and research has shown that creative pursuits can improve your well-being and sharpen your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;You can get better at it, too. Cultivating creativity is like warming up before you exercise, said Jonathan Schooler, a psychologist and director of the Center for Mindfulness and Human Potential at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As you practice creativity, your brain becomes more limber. You become more open-minded and curious. Your mood lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Next week, we’re going to help you stretch and strengthen your creative muscles. Each day, you’ll spend a few minutes completing a stimulating and fun expert-backed exercise, with an explanation of the creativity principle behind it. By Friday, you should feel refreshed and inspired. We hope you’ll join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-433ac70e"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To receive each day’s challenge, make sure you’re signed up for the Well newsletter. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/well" title=""&gt;You can sign up here&lt;/a&gt; or below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you already receive the Well newsletter, you don’t need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-12cc40b2"&gt;What you’ll get&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;An email will arrive in your inbox each morning from Monday, June 2 to Friday, June 6.

But one study recently put an even finer point on the trend: Young men in particular are the ones giving up binge drinking, defined as having five or more alcoholic beverages in one sitting for men, or four or more for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer Gen Z men than women reported binge drinking in the last month between 2021 and 2023, according to the April 2025 &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study in JAMA;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;. Though the gap between men’s and women’s drinking rates has been narrowing over the past several decades, in recent years &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/young-women-now-binge-drink-190942541.html" data-ylk="slk:women’s alcohol use has outpaced men’;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;women’s alcohol use has outpaced men’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="http://s.in/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:s;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The findings have raised alarm bells over women’s high binge-drinking rates. But a closer look shows that the closing gender gap is driven as much, if not more so, by falling bingeing rates among men, especially young adult males. So what’s inspiring young men to drink less or not at all? We looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-numbers-show"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All young adults were drinking less between 2021 and 2023, compared with the 2017-19 period, according to the study. Young women were binge drinking 13% less, but young men saw an even bigger drop — nearly 21%. So it’s not that more women are necessarily binge drinking now — it’s that fewer men are, and that shift has made women’s rates seem higher in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why young men are drinking less is still up for debate, notes study author and University of Pittsburgh internist &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/dgim/faculty_info.aspx/Shuey7447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bryant Shuey;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Bryant Shuey&lt;/a&gt;.

A decade later, he’s hosting the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thatsoberguy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:That Sober Guy;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Sober Guy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast and thinks that “people are waking up to the fact that … it’s so much cooler and respectable and how many more opportunities there are,” when you don’t drink, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-influencers-and-popular-podcasters-making-it-cool-to-drink-less"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are influencers and popular podcasters making it cool to drink less?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ramer, 43, and Saho, 31, are recovering alcoholics. Both grew up in households where drinking — often heavy drinking — was the norm, but it wasn’t talked about. While they’re not part of Gen Z, Ramer and Saho suspect that some of the younger generation had similar experiences. “It took me hitting my rock bottom and almost not being alive for me to tell my dad,” says Saho, referring to his drinking. “You should be able to talk to the men in your life, but until the past five or 10 years, no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s changing with social media, podcasts and vodcasts, especially given that many influential (and, in some cases, controversial) male podcasters with large followings of young men are sober and vocal about it: Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Huberman, for example, have all quit drinking. On &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gtt9bq/i_just_watched_hubermans_video_about_the_effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, several people said that Huberman’s episode on the effects of alcohol have gotten them to quit drinking. Hearing some of them talk about giving up alcohol to focus on the work they enjoy doing resonated with Saho. As he says in one &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brandonsaho/video/7365564795493354782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, it helped inspire him to stay sober.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While social media certainly has its downsides and dangers, Ramer describes a “cultural shift” around drinking that’s having a positive effect on young men. “You have a lot of media and podcasts and celebrity people who are sober and open about it,” he says, adding that this openness provides a sense of community and a path forward for people, including young men, who are considering drinking less — or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:00:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNblBmNGwweS1TTTZXSWpONzNLTndjYjJzX1kzXy1fbG90ald2XzQ5UURxTjNRaXpfVnhJbWtteTVDbzBvVjl0cTJsR3N4dTJGb2F0Z3ZkRG56TjNpM3d4cEdULVpYUEp4VHYycXkzSXZvNFdHYnN4U1VkWUZoeTR2Y3lEd2xITkdCY1o3MTdtazJoSUhsM2pINFNUdWpmUGJiZEJid0VWeXBGempLZXFFZDJpM2NOaW1CVG1GbXpLOHRBMXEzWWh0TQ</guid></item><item><title>年轻男性第一次喝得比年轻女性少。怎么回事？ -雅虎 | Young men are binge drinking less than young women for the 1st time.

But a closer look shows that the closing gender gap is driven as much, if not more so, by falling bingeing rates among men, especially young adult males. So what’s inspiring young men to drink less or not at all? We looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-numbers-show"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All young adults were drinking less between 2021 and 2023, compared with the 2017-19 period, according to the study. Young women were binge drinking 13% less, but young men saw an even bigger drop — nearly 21%. So it’s not that more women are necessarily binge drinking now — it’s that fewer men are, and that shift has made women’s rates seem higher in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why young men are drinking less is still up for debate, notes study author and University of Pittsburgh internist &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/dgim/faculty_info.aspx/Shuey7447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bryant Shuey;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Bryant Shuey&lt;/a&gt;.

A decade later, he’s hosting the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thatsoberguy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:That Sober Guy;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Sober Guy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast and thinks that “people are waking up to the fact that … it’s so much cooler and respectable and how many more opportunities there are,” when you don’t drink, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-influencers-and-popular-podcasters-making-it-cool-to-drink-less"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are influencers and popular podcasters making it cool to drink less?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ramer, 43, and Saho, 31, are recovering alcoholics. Both grew up in households where drinking — often heavy drinking — was the norm, but it wasn’t talked about. While they’re not part of Gen Z, Ramer and Saho suspect that some of the younger generation had similar experiences. “It took me hitting my rock bottom and almost not being alive for me to tell my dad,” says Saho, referring to his drinking. “You should be able to talk to the men in your life, but until the past five or 10 years, no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s changing with social media, podcasts and vodcasts, especially given that many influential (and, in some cases, controversial) male podcasters with large followings of young men are sober and vocal about it: Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Huberman, for example, have all quit drinking. On &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gtt9bq/i_just_watched_hubermans_video_about_the_effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, several people said that Huberman’s episode on the effects of alcohol have gotten them to quit drinking. Hearing some of them talk about giving up alcohol to focus on the work they enjoy doing resonated with Saho. As he says in one &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brandonsaho/video/7365564795493354782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, it helped inspire him to stay sober.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While social media certainly has its downsides and dangers, Ramer describes a “cultural shift” around drinking that’s having a positive effect on young men. “You have a lot of media and podcasts and celebrity people who are sober and open about it,” he says, adding that this openness provides a sense of community and a path forward for people, including young men, who are considering drinking less — or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:00:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQV0phU1ZPWU9CcHFxdTV3VXpQa2h6SXFPY1RkeFExWWxfVGpTeXlyWXdSb0EyWmN4d0VhRGZVSFljdktfWmR3bTJKUlRCVjJoWFVoUmU0QUtZdV9JU3dIUnhfVjF2ODJvNlZNTXpDX19ZeDl1LWItNGZQcEZTcnlJbFZB</guid></item><item><title>2区训练：无需剧烈运动即可燃烧脂肪的热门锻炼- AOL.com | Zone 2 training: The trending workout that burns fat without intense exercise - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE9mSDVmQUI2b0hoazhyQzI2aVFxYkt2LVo1eUNQcEdmQVQ1WmpxUVBvWXYwUjlBMnNtdkE2QWpoMEhPVUt4cy1aSDBJdlFjLVY0a3VabkRfU3g4dUJ5Z2Jhc0lFVkRqZ2Y5RWZENzNqeHRwdnZBVkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exercise that takes a more mild approach while offering all the fat-burning benefits of a more &lt;a href="https://foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grueling workout;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;grueling workout&lt;/a&gt; might sound too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some claim that the trending "Zone 2" training, commonly known as the "fat-burning zone," offers just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this form of exercise — and can it work for anyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.com/health/study-reveals-exercising-every-day-may-not-necessary-better-than-none" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Study Reveals Exercising Every Day May Not Be Necessary: 'Better Than None';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Reveals Exercising Every Day May Not Be Necessary: 'Better Than None'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Zone training is generally defined by someone's proximity to their maximum &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;," Carmine Ciliento, a fitness manager at Crunch Fitness in New York, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zone-based training method measures how hard the body is working and how it's using energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Zone training is based on the exerciser's proximity to their maximum heart rate.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different zones burn different compounds in the body, according to Ciliento.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Zone 2 is working out at about 60% to 70% of someone’s maximum heart rate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.com/health/stay-fit-your-40s-beyond-smart-workout-tips" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stay Fit In Your 40S And Beyond With These Smart Workout Tips;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Fit In Your 40S And Beyond With These Smart Workout Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common way to determine heart rate is to subtract a person's age from 220.

Which works best for these unique situations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When you have various aches and pains, it can be challenging to decide which over-the-counter pain reliever is best matched for your affliction — Advil, Aleve, Tylenol, Motrin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The choice, experts say, really comes down to just two classes of medication: acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or NSAIDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Each addresses pain in its own way, said Mary Lynn McPherson, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.

Seeking help for depression. Living with bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In many ways, the shift in America toward cultural openness around these topics is a cause for celebration, said Christina Caron, a reporter who covers mental health for the Well desk of The New York Times. But the proliferation of online discourse around subjects like trauma disorders and cognitive behavioral therapy can come with a downside: misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s hard to know what’s true,” Ms. Caron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In her new monthly column, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/psych-101" title=""&gt;Psych 101&lt;/a&gt;, Ms. Caron tries to combat that uncertainty by unpacking topics like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/well/moral-injury.html" title=""&gt;what happens when your moral compass is compromised&lt;/a&gt; and how a simple technique &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/well/mind/sleep-cognitive-shuffling.html" title=""&gt;known as cognitive shuffling&lt;/a&gt; can help calm a busy brain. She speaks with people who have experienced the symptoms that she is writing about, as well as clinicians and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Caron is a former clinical research coordinator, so she is familiar with weedy medical terminology. But her goal is to provide readers with trusted — and vetted — health information, without the jargon that can sometimes accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In an interview, Ms. Caron shared how she selects topics for the column and which subjects she wants to tackle next.

They "prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, these &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DNA caps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DNA caps&lt;/a&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Multiple cases of a new &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/covid-19" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; variant NB.1.8.1 have been found by the CDC's airport screening program, CBS News reported on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This variant has been linked to a large outbreak of the virus in China, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks uploaded records that found cases linked to the new NB.1.8.1 variant reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia, and the New York City area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/article-734734" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; GISAID&lt;/a&gt;, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, a virus database, the cases seem to come from travelers from multiple countries. These include Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China, and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The records from the GISAID show that these travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12. &lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;An illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), depicts the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (credit: MAM/CDC/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate from the airport cases, the Nb.1.8.1 variant has begun to be reported by health authorities in states such as Hawaii, Rhode Island, Ohio, California, and Washington State, according to CBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new variant has become dominant in China but is on the rise in parts of Asia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Hong Kong have said that the rates of COVID-19 have spread to the worst levels they have had since last year, CBS reported. CBS noted that Hong Kong authorities claim to have no evidence that the new variant is more severe. However, they have started to urge the citizens to wear masks when in crowded areas or taking public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/world-health-organization" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;The WHO&lt;/a&gt; stated in a report, "Despite a concurrent increase in cases and hospitalizations in some countries where NB.1.8.1 is widespread, current data do not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese researchers' data suggest that the new variant does not evade the immune system better than other strains that seem to be on the rise. However, data show that it may be more transmissible, CBS reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/fda-food-and-drug-administration" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; and CDC have been attempting to choose which strain of COVID-29 they want to have targeted for the next round of vaccinations. According to their officials, the XFC variant has shown significant growth within the US, but its evolution has been unpredictable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to emergency room visits and wastewater testing, rates of COVID-19 have now gone back to low levels in the US, CBS noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization put out a report on the NB.1.8.1 variant. It stated, "Considering the available evidence, the additional public health risk posed by NB.1.8.1 is evaluated as low at the global level.

It's impacted my life, my personal life and my family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mrs Meechan, from West Dunbartonshire, said she had to rely on her husband for household tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There is just no end point to it," she said. "It's a drudge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"And there is only so much pain relief I can take and still try to be a mother to my children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The mother-of-five first went to her GP in 2021. She was found to have a large ovarian cyst and waited a year to see a gynaecologist after a referral from her GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After monitoring the cyst for six months, it had grown, so she was put onto the "urgent" list for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Mrs Meechan says she finds it hard to be a mother to her five children when she is in so much pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is now 100 weeks later and she has not been called for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said: "I was under the impression it would be relatively soon as I was asked if I had any holidays planned in the immediate future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"About a year ago I was advised by the GP to try to get in touch with the gynaecology secretary myself and I have been doing that on a regular basis letting them know I am still here and still waiting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She considered private health care but her surgery would cost £8,000 - something the family could not afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was then she contacted the BBC through &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/send/u187894196" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Your Voice, Your BBC News&lt;/a&gt;.

pledged to bring down NHS waiting lists&lt;/a&gt; and make it easier to get GP appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He set out three priorities: to reduce immediate pressures in the NHS; shift the balance from acute services to the community and to use innovation to improve access to care, promising the health service would carry out an extra 150,000 appointments and procedures in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Then at the end of March, Health Secretary Neil Gray &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp319z2q46do" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;launched the Operational Improvement Plan, &lt;/a&gt;which he said would make the NHS "more accessible" and cut into backlogs for patients to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This would involve an extra £200m in funding for weekend scan appointments and tests and an expansion of hospital care at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The announcement came after the public spending watchdog, Audit Scotland, said NHS initiatives to improve productivity and patient outcomes have yet to have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has been contacted for a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Scottish government said it had delivered around 3,300 additional gynaecology appointments and procedures in 2024-25 and that this year's £21bn health and social care budget would include almost £200m to reduce waiting lists with gynaecology earmarked for extra funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Women's Health Minister Jenni Minto said: "Women's health is key priority for the Scottish government, and we were the first country in the UK to publish a Women's Health Plan, which aims to reduce inequalities in health outcomes for women, in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Timely access to gynaecology services will be a priority in the next phase of our plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Excessively long waits are not acceptable, and I sympathise with any patient whose treatment has failed to reach the standards we all expect from our health system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are working intensively with NHS boards to reduce the length of time people are waiting for appointments and treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 05:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE05QjdYMFJhc3lWWTcxamtDUVp2ZGtxYkVCQjI2eU1OUFltV0ZIaGJWWm5rQldyZ2d0TmRsY2Etd1NSd0xZWnA2UHRHcEcxSl96VTZteG5EaFRKUdIBX0FVX3lxTFBQQnB0eUtSOG43czlDNHQ2aENYbS1RYUZFY0oxODdtR2VwY0JHeWx3LTRjUXc5bWxzNFNOYmF2Zlp1bmdUd0VSXzVROWhqVV84SlIzSFZHV2VlWldsUUhB</guid></item><item><title>为了过上长寿和独立的生活，专家说你需要做这两件事- Fit&amp;Well | To live a long and independent life, experts say you need to do these two things - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQUHFZSlFyUGhDS0h6VU5TUFRkLWtld0hjWEhnR0tOOEtockdUVHFJRGRHNi1jYkRKUlJ2dGd6UEVTUmJJX1V6VFJjS0Ixdml4dklZY3h0dXkzRUNySEFCbTRaXzd2OGlRMkpkUy0yZ1VLMmpzeTkzbi1OZUJab3ZJSFJ0d2VsN0dmWHJjcTV5V09HQ29RZ1RjWl9fYXZCWEg2MTlveGVNbEd6dldFZERJeXlTdWppUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seniors who come to my seated exercise class are concerned about two main things: how to get out of their chair unaided and how to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also keen to have the balance to reach for things in cupboards and be strong enough to tend to their gardens. They want to be able to live independently for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I’ve been speaking to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/catherine-norton-2377291" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/profiles/catherine-norton-2377291" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Catherine Norton&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of sport and exercise nutrition at the University of Limerick, and her exercise physiologist colleague Dr Gráinne Hayes, and they have two major pieces of advice that will help anyone achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing mobility exercises regularly—combined with healthy food choices—is one of the best ways to prevent frailty,” Norton tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-mobility-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Mobility training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In simple terms: if you want to keep doing the things you love—whether that’s gardening, dancing or playing with grandkids — mobility matters,” says Hayes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mobility training is one of the unsung heroes of healthy ageing. It helps keep our joints moving freely, improves posture, and reduces the risk of falls and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these aspects lead to reduced risk of injury, improved circulation, and minimised wear and tear on your joints, something which is increasingly an important issue as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WKKLUTKBKHReArYqjdU9oM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WKKLUTKBKHReArYqjdU9oM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mobility training does not outweigh strength training or cardio, but should be incorporated to promote and improve one’s performance, be that for activities of daily living or for sports performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says we should all start mobility exercises now—“the earlier, the better—but it’s never too late to start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like brushing your teeth, mobility should be a daily habit from childhood. That said, people in their 40s and beyond often see real improvements in how they move and feel just by making it a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; World Health Organisation recommends&lt;/a&gt; that older adults should do a variety of exercise which helps with functional balance, three or more days a week. That could mean something like Tai Chi or mobility moves like the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-physical-therapist-says-you-should-do-this-exercise-if-you-want-to-pass-the-sit-stand-test-when-you-re-older" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-physical-therapist-says-you-should-do-this-exercise-if-you-want-to-pass-the-sit-stand-test-when-you-re-older"&gt;sit-to-stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need to spend hours on it,” says Hayes. “Even five to 10 minutes a day can make a big difference. Make it simple: a morning stretch and a few minutes of movement before bed. The key is consistency, not perfection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norton has some fun advice too; ”Mobility is about freedom. It helps us stay independent, confident and connected to the world around us. And it doesn’t have to be boring!” she says. “Dance in the kitchen or stretch while watching TV. Every little bit adds life to your years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-eat-a-mediterranean-style-diet"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Eat a Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutrition is a key player in how we move and feel,” says Norton. “A Mediterranean-style diet rich in colourful fruit, vegetables, fish and healthy fats can help reduce inflammation and support joint health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet has been recommended by various health organisations and experts, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/07-05-2018-fostering-healthier-and-more-sustainable-diets-learning-from-the-mediterranean-and-new-nordic-experience" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/07-05-2018-fostering-healthier-and-more-sustainable-diets-learning-from-the-mediterranean-and-new-nordic-experience" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;the World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norton breaks down what to include in your diet to mimic it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein helps maintain muscle strength—think fish, lean meats, eggs, dairy, tofu, beans and lentils.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy fats from sources like oily fish, olive oil, avocado and nuts can reduce joint inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calcium and vitamin D support bone health—dairy products, leafy greens, fortified foods and safe sun exposure are all helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antioxidant-rich foods, such as berries, peppers, green tea and turmeric can help to ease inflammation and stiffness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydration matters too—dehydrated tissues are less elastic and more prone to injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need some more inspiration?

Adipose (fat) tissue releases inflammatory chemicals that clash with the immune system, which can cause inflammation in the skin, and psoriasis' trademark red, scaly rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team of dermatologists from King’s College &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-29f49ec0-3a74-11f0-80a7-1bbe1091aede"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; analyzed data from over 330,000 white people living in the UK, including more than 9,000 with psoriasis, which affects roughly 7.5million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They examined 25 different body fat measures using traditional methods, such as calipers that pinch skin folds, and advanced imaging techniques, such as highly specialized X-ray scans, assessing how each was associated with psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found the waist-to-hip ratio on a person was the strongest risk factor for psoriasis, but didn't reveal why specifically that type of fat had the strongest association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ravi Ramessur, lead investigator on the study, said: ‘Our research shows that where fat is stored in the body matters when it comes to psoriasis risk. Central fat — especially around the waist — seems to play a key role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This has important implications for how we identify individuals who may be more likely to develop psoriasis or experience more severe disease, and how we approach prevention and treatment strategies.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin condition that produces inflammatory chemicals, leading to a red, painful rash on the skin (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers measured overall ‘central’ fat around the torso, encompassing subcutaneous fat right below the skin’s surface, and dangerous visceral fat that wraps around the organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between central fat and psoriasis remained consistent regardless of genetic predisposition, indicating that abdominal fat is an independent risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catherine Smith, senior author, said: 'As rates of obesity continue to rise globally, understanding how different patterns of body fat influence chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis is important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that central body fat contributes to psoriasis risk irrespective of genetic predisposition and reinforces the importance of measuring waist circumference and pro-active healthy weight strategies in psoriasis care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to releasing inflammatory compounds, fat tissue hijacks the body’s balance of hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hormone leptin normally signals to the brain the body is full and it’s time to stop eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But fat cells overproduce this hormone, breaking that ‘stop eating’ signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The obesity rate among American adults increased from 21.2 percent in 1990 to 43.8 percent in 2022 for women and 16.9 percent to 41.6 percent for men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overabundance of leptin also stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines, leading to a psoriasis breakout of painful rashes and subsequent flare-ups in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a related editorial, Dr Joel Gelfand, a dermatology expert at the University of Pennsylvania, highlights the promise of specific gut hormone therapies – mainly GLP-1 and GIP, which help control blood sugar, digestion, and hunger – as potential therapies for psoriatic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones, sold under brands like Ozmepic, Wegovy and Zepbound, are already used to treat diabetes, obesity, and obesity-related sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 NIH-funded report in the journal Psoriasis analyzed four studies involving 23 patients with both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes who took a GLP-1 receptor agonist drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every study showed significant reductions in PASI scores, a measure of psoriasis severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two studies showed fewer markers of inflammation in layers of the skin and reduced harmful immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also reported improved quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found that the link between fat in the abdomen and psoriasis risk was consistent regardless of whether the people had a genetic predisposition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, researchers are exploring whether the drugs could also help manage psoriatic disease, possibly by tackling the inflammation and metabolic issues linked to psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Gelfand, the powerful link between obesity and psoriasis, as well as the evidence that GLP-1 drugs could alleviate symptoms, signals it’s time to launch clinical trials testing the drugs specifically for psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The strong relationship between psoriasis and obesity and the emerging promise of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) for reducing psoriasis morbidity is a call to action for large scale clinical trials of GLP1RA monotherapy for treatment of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our current paradigm of just focusing on the skin and joint manifestations when treating psoriasis is outdated in the context of our evolving understanding of the tight relationship of psoriasis, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She said she ignored the symptom, attributing it to her recently inserted intrauterine device, or &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/woman-thought-iud-fell-out-x-ray/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:IUD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;IUD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News and Media&lt;/p&gt; Jasmin McKee shaved her head and donated her hair before starting chemotherapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one ever wants to think the worst, so that's why I didn't really think anything of the bleeding and just brushed it off,” McKee said. "Irregular bleeding" is not an uncommon side effect of an IUD according to &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/intrauterine-devices-iud" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that most women experience the symptom after insertion of their IUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any other symptoms, McKee said, were chalked up to her ongoing menstrual struggles. “I'd had quite heavy periods and bad back pain and would be really tired but I always put it down to hormones and my period,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she did attend her annual gynecological exam, McKee’s pap test discovered abnormal cells — and later tests confirmed she had stage 3 cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's like the world stops moving a little bit,” McKee said. “They're using all these big words and talking at you in a way that's really hard to grasp. It's that numb feeling, I don't think I've stopped feeling like that. It's like I'm living in 'the in-between.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She opted to undergo laser treatment instead of &lt;a href="https://people.com/teddi-mellencamp-rings-bell-end-of-radiation-treatment-stage-4-cancer-diagnosis-11709001" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:radiation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/colon-cancer-180-chemo-treatments-mom-facing-her-end-11703601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemotherapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that she could preserve her fertility and have children in the future, but was later given the bleak news that the treatment had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, McKee began radiation treatment. “The doctor said it was likely I won't be able to have children naturally and that's the worst outcome for me,” said McKee, who &lt;a href="https://people.com/olivia-munn-froze-eggs-have-future-babies-with-john-mulaney-8647264" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:froze her eggs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;froze her eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of an IUD&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting chemotherapy, McKee cut her hair and donated it, explaining, “I thought, ‘If I'm going to lose my hair I might as well do it on my terms and do something good with it.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she’s “grateful” she finally had her pap test, explaining, “If I hadn't had it done then I probably would've just kept on putting it off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKee explained, “You can sit and overthink it and you might read other women's experiences online but it's so easy to do. It's literally 10 to 15 minutes of your time and it can save your life.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-26-given-bleak-prognosis-after-ignored-post-sex-bleeding-11740824" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 03:45:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5DTE16U0ZCY0ljWFdJRkhQRTRzRGlSSFNsdVJGMkJrTXVhMTZZVnJMRzBjTUJ5cC1oYko1Z0JYWWhSaUppX1F6LTdicVNHejRHUEVTN2cwYThMY0Y4alZVVHhDTDhaeWlfVFMzSTVGY3ZFdDA</guid></item><item><title>科学家将瞳孔扩张与大脑最重要的“工作记忆”水平联系起来- Earth.com | Scientists link pupil dilation to the brain’s all-important 'working memory' levels - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRS1aTER6SFlfNWpnQzVSelN0ajJ3aGEyc1hJUGZyMnB3cUdGSVBzcVN4X2o4a3MxSmo5eUE3S3N3cmRpYXJiaDRtWnRodUFCckZDdXlZT3RaR2lGb1kwemh6V0JGcVkzZDA5V0ZScVlNVFpCSHpQYk9ZS3ZaLVI2azJNb2x6WkVoaHVKSG1GdlZKdEVi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two things often happen at the same time in a busy kitchen: plates clatter into the dishwasher and a mental note pops up that the soap dispenser is running low. The brain keeps both thoughts alive for a few seconds, steers the hands, and updates the grocery list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this swift juggle “working memory,” yet most people know it simply as keeping track of what matters right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have spent decades mapping this mental scratchpad, but its quirks still surprise. The latest clue comes from the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh study suggests that the way a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pupil-size-during-sleep-decides-if-new-or-old-memories-are-replayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupils change&lt;/a&gt; while they concentrate hints at how well that mental scratchpad is working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-working-memory-matters"&gt;Why working memory matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working memory does more than hold stray reminders; it stitches together phone digits until they are dialed, keeps track of a spoken sentence until the meaning lands, and buffers half-finished ideas during problem-solving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-our-brain-form-long-term-memories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;long-term memory&lt;/a&gt;, it works on a tight clock measured in seconds. Because the capacity is finite – typically three to seven items at once – small differences in efficiency can ripple through reading, mathematics, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists often compare working-memory scores among people of similar age, finding wide gaps. Some differences trace back to genetics, sleep quality, and stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others appear linked to how sharply someone focuses in the moment. Pinning down those fleeting attentional shifts has been tough, so a team at the &lt;a href="https://www.uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Texas at Arlington&lt;/a&gt; turned to a simple, involuntary signal from the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eyes-signal-focus-level"&gt;Eyes signal focus level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor of psychology Matthew Robison and doctoral student Lauren D. Garner, both from UTA’s &lt;a href="https://camlab.uta.edu/lab-members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CAM Lab&lt;/a&gt;, recruited 179 undergraduate volunteers for a set of memory challenges designed to last only a few heartbeats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eye-tracking camera, like the one an optometrist uses, recorded pupil size while each participant tried to remember colors, shapes, or letters flashed on a screen. The pupils were expected to widen in the dimly lit lab, yet they also fluctuated with mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we found was that the lowest performers on the tasks showed less &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pupils-reveal-how-active-the-brain-is-even-during-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupil dilation&lt;/a&gt;,” Robison explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the highest-performing participants, pupil dilations were larger overall, and they were more discerning about the information they were asked to recall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-working-memory-and-larger-pupils"&gt;Working memory and larger pupils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/specific-eye-features-influence-how-others-perceive-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pupil dilation&lt;/a&gt; is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, the same circuitry that speeds the heartbeat under stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research showed the pupils twitch in sync with challenges such as mental arithmetic, signaling rising cognitive load. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work links that physical reaction directly to the accuracy of working memory: bigger, more precisely timed dilations tracked with sharper recall across the entire group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study appears in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/13414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Attention, Perception &amp;amp; Psychophysics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and its key takeaway has immediate practical value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers, coaches, and clinicians could someday use a non-invasive gaze sensor to see whether a student’s attention slips long before test scores reveal a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-attention-and-cognitive-load"&gt;Attention and cognitive load&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye-memory link lines up with a well-known theory called “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1057/978-1-137-00772-8_677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;resource allocation&lt;/a&gt;,” which proposes that the brain funnels more energy – oxygen, glucose, and electrical activity – toward information flagged as important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dilating pupil mirrors that surge. When the surge is weak or mistimed, fewer details make it onto the mental scratchpad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday distractions, from buzzing phones to background chatter, can sap that resource. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, practice with activities that demand steady focus, such as playing certain musical instruments or fast-paced video games, has been shown to nudge working-memory scores upward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those lifestyle influences mesh neatly with the new pupil data, suggesting the eyes could become a quick biofeedback tool for attention training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-classroom-and-clinic-uses"&gt;Classroom and clinic uses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individualized instruction often starts with trial and error. A live readout of pupil patterns could speed the process by showing when a student is overwhelmed or under-engaged in real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That information might guide a teacher to slow the pace, rephrase directions, or add a break exactly when it counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that people who more intensely and consistently paid attention, as measured by their pupils being dilated more, performed better on the memory tasks,” Robison enthused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, we found high performers also showed more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pupil-size-reveals-hidden-cognitive-fatigue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupil sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; compared to low-performing participants. This is exciting research because it adds another valuable piece of the puzzle to our understanding of why working memory varies between individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-working-memory-in-shape"&gt;Keeping working memory in shape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While future gadgets may monitor focus automatically, old-school habits still help. Brief pauses during dense reading let fresh material settle before more arrives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizing tidbits into tiny clusters – phone numbers into three short chunks, for example – reduces the load. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/practicing-mindfulness-can-quiet-the-noise-of-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mindfulness exercises&lt;/a&gt; that train sustained attention have gained traction, and emerging evidence suggests they may slightly enlarge working-memory capacity over weeks of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even aerobic movement matters. Studies tracking middle-aged adults find that brisk walking improves blood flow to brain regions involved in executive control, indirectly supporting the memory buffer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The take-home message echoes common sense: whatever boosts overall &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/moderate-belly-fat-may-actually-boost-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; tends to support the few precious slots on that internal notepad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pupils-working-memory-and-future-study"&gt;Pupils, working memory, and future study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UT Arlington experiment adds a clear, measurable signpost to the study of working memory. By tying pupil behavior to test performance in 179 young adults, it builds a bridge between subjective focus and objective outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger studies spanning different ages and cultures are already in the planning stages, aiming to see whether the same patterns hold in childhood development, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/taking-vitamin-d-supplements-may-add-years-to-your-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mind-diet-may-protect-cognitive-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they do, tracking a tiny change in the eyes might soon guide personalized learning plans, aid early diagnoses of attention deficits, or help engineers design user interfaces that adapt to a person’s real-time mental load. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the findings serve as a reminder that the eyes are broadcasting more than mood or alertness – they may be giving away the secrets of how we juggle the small but vital tasks that keep life running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-024-02853-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Attention Perception &amp;amp; Psychophysics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 02:34:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRS1aTER6SFlfNWpnQzVSelN0ajJ3aGEyc1hJUGZyMnB3cUdGSVBzcVN4X2o4a3MxSmo5eUE3S3N3cmRpYXJiaDRtWnRodUFCckZDdXlZT3RaR2lGb1kwemh6V0JGcVkzZDA5V0ZScVlNVFpCSHpQYk9ZS3ZaLVI2azJNb2x6WkVoaHVKSG1GdlZKdEVi</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法， 4种方法可以判断您的补充剂是否真的有效- EatingWell | 4 Ways to Tell If Your Supplements Are Actually Working, According to Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1qZmp0MkhWWm1CajJXSXE0WHBQMk96QUpQWTBoRUVxbHpYY29yaklXdzlBVDZzdnhpcjlfZ1BmNllqZmJLYlJXd19ycnZiY3hiMjdQWklVaWM1ak0zaXJvUFRyN3RZTG9YdWhyOWRTUkx5N3BrS2Nuc1FUZkVwekE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When taking a supplement, it's important to determine if it's being effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for physical or mental changes that match your supplement’s goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use lab tests to track nutrient levels and supplement impact over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many people, starting a new supplement often comes with the hope of general wellness and improved health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But figuring out if that pill, powder, liquid or gummy is making an observable impact can be rather tricky. With so many variables influencing your health, from your diet and lifestyle to underlying conditions, it can be hard to pinpoint if your supplement is actually working. The key is to approach supplementation with a clear, well-defined plan and purpose. In other words, “be sure you’re taking a supplement with a desired outcome and know what that outcome is before you start,” says &lt;a href="https://isabelsmithnutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Isabel Smith, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have your desired goal in mind, follow these expert-backed tips to determine if your supplement is living up to its claims.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-look-for-noticeable-signs-of-improvement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Look for Noticeable Signs of Improvement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To find out if your supplement is truly making a difference, start by looking for noticeable changes that match the intended benefits. Keep in mind that these changes will vary depending on the type of supplement. For example, you may notice improved bone health from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-take-vitamin-d-and-calcium-at-the-same-time-8684625" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D and calcium supplements&lt;/a&gt; or relieve occasional constipation by taking a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-supplements-8425114" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium supplement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzannerabi/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Suzanne Soliman, Pharm.D., BCMAS&lt;/a&gt;, says that in general, &lt;em&gt;obvious &lt;/em&gt;signs of supplement effectiveness include improvements like increased energy, less digestive discomfort, better sleep quality, improved mood and enhanced physical performance. On the other hand, she explains that subtler changes often encompass gradual progress over time, such as a reduced reliance on certain medications, shifts in blood markers, changes in appetite or stress response and an improved sense of overall well-being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Soliman cautions to “be mindful of placebo effects and consider a trial period to truly assess the supplement’s impact.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that improved health outcomes may not always come from the supplement itself but rather the psychological belief that the supplement will make you feel better, which is known as the placebo effect. To see if your supplement really works, give it a trial run. During the trial period, objectively pay attention to signs of improvement while keeping your daily routine, diet and exercise regimen consistent. This way, you’ll be able to tell if the supplement is helping you reach your health goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-consider-how-long-it-takes-to-see-changes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Consider How Long It Takes to See Changes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While watching for signs of improvement, it’s natural to want instant results. But the reality is that some supplement benefits take time. “Numerous factors, such as the particular supplement, the person's nutritional state, the reason for taking the supplement, dosage, regularity of use and general health, can significantly affect how long it takes to get results from a supplement,” says Soliman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soliman says that typically, some people may notice minor improvements in health outcomes in as little as two to four weeks. However, “it usually takes one to three months of regular use to see more obvious results, particularly when it comes to treating deficiencies or health issues.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for chronic concerns and long-term health goals, Soliman notes that some supplements may not show noticeable effects for three to six months or more. She highlights that depending on the severity of deficiency, “it may take longer for supplements to raise nutrient levels in the body, such as vitamin D or certain minerals.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about how long it will take to see results and set realistic expectations about supplement outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-use-lab-tests-to-track-progress"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Use Lab Tests to Track Progress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Lab tests can be valuable tools to confirm if a supplement is working by directly measuring the levels of specific nutrients or related biomarkers in your body,” says Soliman. Your doctor can order certain blood tests and panels to measure specific markers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Below are some common supplements and the markers Soliman suggests monitoring:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in the blood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B12 and folate&lt;/strong&gt;: Check serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Methylmalonic acid can also indicate B12 deficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/strong&gt;: An Omega-3 Index test measures the percentage of EPA and DHA in red blood cell membranes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/strong&gt;: Check serum vitamin C levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin E&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor serum alpha-tocopherol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium and magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor serum calcium (total and ionized) and serum magnesium levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride)&lt;/strong&gt;: An electrolyte panel can assess these levels, which might be relevant for certain supplements or health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory markers (for supplements like curcumin or fish oil)&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider C-reactive protein (CRP) or other inflammatory markers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood glucose and lipids (for metabolic support supplements)&lt;/strong&gt;: Monitor fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When supplements can’t be tracked and even when they can, you want to also check kidney and liver function tests (AST, ALT, creatinine, GFR and others),” Smith adds. She emphasizes that these tests are important because the liver and kidneys play a vital role in processing and filtering substances out of the body, including supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; High-dose and prolonged use of supplements can potentially damage these organs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, regular tests can help to ensure the kidneys and liver are healthy and functioning at their best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-make-informed-decisions-about-supplementation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Make Informed Decisions about Supplementation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most important factors to ensure your supplement works as intended is making &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;informed decisions about supplementation&lt;/a&gt; by selecting products from reputable brands. Both experts agree that you should choose brands that follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to ensure the supplement contains the ingredients listed on the label and is free from harmful contaminants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Look for independently-verified seals like NSF, USP and ConsumerLab to verify that you’re selecting a trustworthy product.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Soliman also recommends avoiding “proprietary blends” without specific ingredient amounts, being cautious of vague, unrealistic health claims and checking if the supplement has scientific backing. Most importantly, you should always disclose all supplements to your healthcare provider and reach out if you have any concerns.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Evaluating whether your supplement actually works requires careful observation, patience and proper testing. To accurately determine its effectiveness, it’s best to take a strategic approach by considering any subtle or obvious shifts in your health, understanding realistic timelines, tracking progress with specific lab markers and choosing supplement brands with third-party verification. Before starting a new supplement, you should always consult a healthcare provider to make sure the supplement is suitable for your needs. With professional guidance and thoughtful planning, you will be able to clearly identify if your supplement is truly delivering on its promises.&lt;br&gt;

In 2023, cardiovascular disease (CVDs) accounted for 17.9 million deaths worldwide. Of these deaths, a significant portion (85%) were due to heart attack and stroke. Though many heart attacks are preventable through simple, consistent daily habits, it is often overlooked. Dr. Vassily Eliopoulos, M.D., a board-certified emergency medicine doctor from New York, known as Dr. Vass, shares five evidence-based habits to protect heart health and reduce the risk of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you never, ever want to be the person who gets surprised by a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/health/how-silent-heart-attacks-are-killing-seemingly-fit-indians/articleshow/121410648.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, here are the five healthy habits that you need in your life. Most heart attacks don't happen out of nowhere. They build slowly through habits that you didn't even know were hurting,” he notes in a video shared on Instagram. Here are the five heart-healthy habits that you can follow to reduce the risk of heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right. Something as basic as a walk can reduce the chances of a heart attack. A brisk 10-minute walk after meals can significantly lower blood sugar spikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar spikes contribute to inflammation and plaque buildup in arteries, the key risk factors for heart disease. “Even walking for just 10 minutes after a meal can help lower that postprandial blood sugar spike,” Dr. Vass explained. Research also backs the habit of post-meal walking as it improves glucose control and reduces cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids into your diet is critical for heart health. Dr. Vass recommends eating wild-caught fish like salmon or taking a high-quality omega-3 supplement. “Wild-caught fish or a high-quality omega-3 supplement can help to lower triglyceride levels, lower intravascular inflammation, and reduce arterial stiffness,” he said. The American Heart Association emphasizes that omega-3s decrease triglycerides and may lower the risk of coronary artery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; also confirm that omega-3 supplementation can reduce cardiovascular events, like heart attack or stroke, in people who already have cardiovascular disease (CVD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is non-negotiable for heart health, the doctor said. “Sleeping less than six hours a night can increase heart attack risk by up to 200%,” Dr. Vass warned. It is important to get a good night’s sleep every day, as if your life depends on it. Prioritize sleep, and aim for consistency and eight quality hours a night. Insufficient sleep is linked to higher risks of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;RFK Jr. Openly Tells World To Exit 'Bloated' WHO As Global Health Officials Watch Silently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, exposure to plastics can harm heart health. Dr. Vass advises switching to glass containers to avoid chemicals like phthalates, which are found in plastics. These chemicals are linked to inflammation and arterial damage. “Plastics leak chemicals like phthalates, which disrupt hormones, drive inflammation, and over time, can help to push hardening of the arteries,” he said. “Store food in glass, filter your water, and never heat anything in plastic.” Several studies have found that phthalate exposure is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine blood tests can reveal heart attack risk years before symptoms appear, but standard cholesterol checks may not tell the full story. Dr. Vass urges monitoring advanced markers like apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, and high-sensitivity CRP on a regular basis. “These can help show your real heart attack risk, years before any symptoms show up,” he said. “You likely don’t need a prescription. You need the right habits, the right data, and consistency.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 02:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>来自人类伤口的微生物能够以医院塑料为食- ScienceAlert | Microbe From Man's Wound Able to Feed on Hospital Plastic - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOci01bVdTVzQ2ZkRQWlROV2RWM3dBQUxraDJfMW5XckllOGlhaWtvSnNIM1M5eWEtWXVyRURYMWJ4VUdUMDctQzRya2lGaWV2bWt0STJ6YlNyeVhTTnp4VnFKZXdIb3Ywb3o0NFBSM2ZpOVNldEtVN3ViUzh4NWQ3aFJENXVkN3ZQQjk4MUhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Plastic pollution is one of the defining environmental challenges of our time – and some of nature's tiniest organisms may offer a surprising way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, microbiologists have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-plastic-eating-bacteria-actually-work-a-chemist-explains-95233"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; bacteria capable of breaking down various types of plastic, hinting at a more sustainable path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These "plastic-eating" microbes could one day help shrink the mountains of waste clogging landfills and oceans. But they are not always a perfect fix. In the wrong environment, they could cause serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastics are widely used in hospitals in things such as sutures (especially the dissolving type), wound dressings and implants. So might the bacteria found in hospitals break down and feed on plastic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, we studied the genomes of known hospital pathogens (harmful bacteria) to see if they had the same plastic-degrading enzymes found in some bacteria in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00421-8"&gt;surprised to find&lt;/a&gt; that some hospital germs, such as &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, might be able to break down plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131937" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background.jpg" alt="artist impression of pseudomonas" class="wp-image-131937 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/pseudomonas_black_background-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-131937" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Artist's impression of &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;. (Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is associated with about 559,000 deaths globally each year. And many of the infections are picked up in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients on ventilators or with open wounds from surgery or burns are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pseudomonas-aeruginosa/about/index.html"&gt;particular risk&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; infection. As are those who have catheters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to move forward from our computational search of bacterial databases to test the plastic-eating ability of &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on one specific strain of this bacterium that had a gene for making a plastic-eating enzyme. It had been isolated from a patient with a wound infection. We discovered that not only could it break down plastic, it could use the plastic as food to grow. This ability comes from an enzyme we named Pap1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biofilms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; is considered a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461"&gt;high-priority pathogen&lt;/a&gt; by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="162718" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. It can form tough layers called biofilms that protect it from the immune system and antibiotics, which makes it very hard to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group has previously shown that when environmental bacteria form biofilms, they can break down &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-023-00440-1#:%7E:text=In%20an%20innovative%20approach%20to,overall%20rate%20of%20plastic%20degradation."&gt;plastic faster&lt;/a&gt;. So we wondered whether having a plastic-degrading enzyme might help &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; to be a pathogen. Strikingly, it does. This enzyme made the strain more harmful and helped it build bigger biofilms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; was building a bigger biofilm when it was on plastic, we broke the biofilm apart. Then we analysed what the biofilm was made of and found that this pathogen was producing bigger biofilms by including the degraded plastic in this slimy shield – or "matrix", as it is formally known. &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; was using the plastic as cement to build a stronger bacterial community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogens like &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; can survive for a long time in hospitals, where plastics are everywhere. Could this persistence in hospitals be due to the pathogens' ability to eat plastics? We think this is a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many medical treatments involve plastics, such as orthopaedic implants, catheters, dental implants and hydrogel pads for treating burns. Our study suggests that a pathogen that can degrade the plastic in these devices could become a serious issue. This can make the treatment fail or make the patient's condition worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, scientists are working on solutions, such as adding antimicrobial substances to medical plastics to stop germs from feeding on them. But now that we know that some germs can break down plastic, we'll need to consider that when choosing materials for future medical use.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256945/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Any yard work. I work at an eye doctor's office, and starting in spring, we get at least one patient a week coming in because they got something in their eye while doing yard work.

I'm an EMT and will never forget coming to work and seeing a friend of mine typing up his report after a co-sleeping fatality call. During the call, he and his partner attempted to resuscitate a baby who was suffocated from co-sleeping.

A tooth that once throbbed/hurt when biting and then stopped likely became necrotic and died. That zit-looking bump on the gums near the tooth's root (a fistula) that 'comes and goes' doesn't mean the problem is gone. There's a space in the bone of your jaw/skull that is being eaten away and filled with pus as the infection is left untreated. Especially on an upper tooth, that infection can easily spread into neighboring tooth structures, possibly requiring IV antibiotics, and can even be fatal. There's a fascial space in the head and neck area called 'the danger zone' because of how easily an infection can spread if it violates that space."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Andreswd / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Ignoring dental cleanings is dangerous.

I was feeling fatalistically calm waiting for the results until I spoke to one of its inventors, Raymond Mak. Early on, Mak decided he would not glimpse his own mortality via his machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Were you scared, I ask. Scared of the power of what you’d done? It’s hard to believe it from this associate professor of radiation oncology at&lt;span&gt; Harvard Medical School. But the longer I talk to him and his co-founder Hugo Aerts, fellow Harvard professor and director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine programme at Mass General Brigham, the more I feel uneasy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They proved in a large clinical trial that the older you look — to FaceAge — the sooner you will die. Although its decision on my photo takes a while because it has to be emailed to Harvard and back, in practice the FaceAge AI makes its judgment in a fraction of a second and from a simple selfie. It also makes a mockery of humanity’s primitive ideas of ageing, distracted by grey hair or wrinkles. It sees us age in ways we ourselves cannot, casting a merciless eye on wasting muscles, bones and eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Not only do the pair believe this AI could be used benignly as a “fifth vital sign” (after temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure) to aid medical decisions, but it has almost unfathomable consequences for society. In an instant we could see the potential longevity of anyone from a prospective husband to a presidential candidate, whether they like it or not. Or get a morning mortality report on our own reflection in a smart mirror. That which we might wish to remain secret, our face, window-like, will betray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It was like a &lt;i&gt;Gattaca&lt;/i&gt; thing,” Mak tells me via video call, referencing the science fiction film in which humans were stratified by their propensity for disease. “Do I really want to know? I don’t really want to know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We live in a world that has become obsessed, whether through social media filters or surgery, with facial youthfulness. In &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt;, Oscar Wilde seemed to be summing up 2025 when he wrote: “It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.” FaceAge is technology perfect for the spirit of our age: health is indeed skin-deep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/beauty/article/night-skincare-products-overnight-serum-moisturiser-q0w9cd2xl" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Night-time skincare: 5 of the best overnight products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“How old you look matters,” Aerts says. “If you look older than your peers, you die earlier. Nobody has shown this direct correlation between the two before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mak and Aerts have long collaborated on training machines to assist the accuracy of doctors, for example in improving tumour-detection in scans. One day they had the idea that they could help doctors not just with scans, but a metric doctors use to make life-changing medical decisions every day, aka “the eyeball test”. Mak explained that the eyeball test is particularly important in his field of oncology. If he sees two patients of the same age with the same cancer, and one bounds in with rosy cheeks from shovelling snow, and the other looks crumpled and sick, Mak will be inclined to assume the former will withstand a more brutal, more powerful, treatment regime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But what if doctors were fooling themselves as to their own abilities? Aerts and Mak ran a study in which eight oncologists and palliative care specialists were shown faces of 100 terminally ill patients, and asked to judge which had lasted six months. On average they got it right around 60 per cent of the time, according to a study the pair published in a paper in The Lancet Digital Health journal this month. “Not much better than a coin toss,” Mak says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The take-home from that is that humans are not great at assessing mortality from a photo? “Absolutely.” When those doctors were also given the patient’s medical history, mirroring the kind of judgment these experts make thousands of times in their careers, their accuracy improved to about 70 per cent. It is worth bearing this error margin in mind if you are in receipt of a vital prognosis. Could a computer do better? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Aerts and Mak got to work on training their AI. Much attention has recently been given to facial age estimation apps trained on teenage faces, primarily used to kick them off social media and porn sites. FaceAge would be the opposite: training AI to pinpoint signs our cellular resilience is winding down, aka “biological age”. It gatekeeps the afterlife, rather than Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For the study, FaceAge was applied to more than 6,000 cancer patients who were about to start treatment for radiology, using photos routinely taken by technical staff. It had been trained on data sets of nearly 60,000 presumed healthy people — a number that has since risen to 40 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It said the cancer patients on average looked five years older,” Mak says. “That was when we realised this might be something real, not a gimmick.” The more advanced their cancer, the older they looked. The next stage was assessing whether “looking older” according to AI had meaning, and it did. The older AI estimated the cancer patient’s age, the sooner they died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Those were the two big aha moments,” Mak says. “It was a clinically meaningful signal, it was prognostic. There was useful biological information embedded in the face … You are going to do worse the older you look. You’re more likely to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/the-man-who-is-going-to-live-to-180-or-die-trying-bhm83mhw5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The man who is going to live to 180 (or die trying)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;How does FaceAge do better than our age perception? It isn’t bothered by traditional signs of ageing, assuaged by make-up, hair transplants or fillers. It seems to look at areas we ignore, such as the size of the temporalis, a muscle that governs bite strength. “That’s not something we expected,” Aerts says. The loss of this muscle shows up as hollowing at the temple, which may be a subtle marker for overall frailty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The AI also seems interested in an ineffable peachiness of the eyes. Next is the width of the nose bone, which thins with age. Thus the only cosmetic surgery it is flummoxed by is rhinoplasty, which FaceAge thinks makes a person look older. When FaceAge was asked to predict which of the terminally ill patients would die in six months simply from a photo, it got it right more than 80 per cent of the time, beating the specialist doctors who had access to full medical histories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Should doctors be wary of the eyeball test in future? “I think yes,” Mak says. “Some doctors might say, ‘I don’t need AI to tell me how old someone looks.’ That may be fair, but why not have a tool to make your judgment a little better?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Is this leading to AI being embedded in your bathroom mirror or smartphone camera, exclaiming, “Oh, mate, you look rough today!” and alerting your GP? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Absolutely,” Mak says. Their research shows repeated photos over time are even more powerful and accurate than one snapshot. “Looking old is bad; rapid ageing is super bad — you’re even more likely to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Mak says the scientist in him knows they have years of research to go before FaceAge could be used as a biomarker in clinical settings, “but the futurist in me believes that this is where this goes next”. Aerts adds: “That would be the dream, that this is your early warning system. ‘Hey, something is up! We don’t know what, but go see your doctor.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The ease of a photo is FaceAge’s blessing and curse. The pair grapple with ethical quandaries no one has yet imagined. “Our team are all a little bit afraid of misuse,” Aerts tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The kiss of a camera lens is less invasive than a blood test or MRI, but those tests are confidential. FaceAge is invasive in another way: anyone with your photo could potentially check your biological age. Do you want that to become part of the recruitment process for your next CEO? Or prime minister? Or health insurance? Your consent may be irrelevant if your holiday snaps are all over Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“You could walk into your grocery store and they could do an instant health assessment of you from your photo,” Aerts says. “That is feasible, and it’s not even a gimmick. We can predict this individual’s biological age, and it matters as to how early they will die. Do we want this? This is a double-edged sword — we have to make sure the good outweighs the bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I asked Aerts whether he had been tempted to run a whole bank of photos of well-known figures through FaceAge, and he replied that collectively they had decided against. He ran it on himself and it guessed his age pretty accurately, although he warns it is less reliable in the under-50s. Last month Mak finally caved and nervously did it on himself: it said he was 10 years younger than his real age of 46. “I was surprised,” Mak says. He has three young children “and right now I feel more like 60”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I get my results back. Each of my three photos, one without make-up, puts me somewhere in my thirties — one as young as 32, a full two decades younger than my chronological age. Initially I’m pleased, of course, but then I’m not. My family is riddled with genetic illnesses that took my parents too soon and my knees crack like glowsticks. If FaceAge had said I looked ten years younger I would have been encouraged. Yet this huge gap now makes the whole thing feel phoney, more like the sleazy waiter who pretends I’m the sister to my teenage daughter. Oh, FaceAge, I’m not falling for your tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPbmlWb0dYZ1M2UVhsX05ZeTVyeWk1VVRBVjM4RW1Ua1p4UVJFNGNfR1ZHei1salV4VGxTY3BEMnNCTTdkbE90U0p0Y0N3aHE3MTF2eTgzRkNjWjBLMVBZaUxMRy1GcW1qbTlRVm9SM0hoSVRKYk1OWnB3U1BBT05aN3RFTkZNMzVORVNYQ0tOUFJFTjNFWGxIU0V3U01GaFBNeTI2VDhqaFAxYlNUQ3pPYXVMaEhQZw</guid></item><item><title>老年人锻炼：如何保持定期体育锻炼的动力-德撒律新闻 | Exercising for older adults: How to stay motivated for regular physical activity - Deseret News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQU3FTVjhLcWtNOFU2VzZPTktOSUlmVGlzVVZUUDdDVDlfZnZjblJRUng1R1J2eVYxeFV3YlNxUl9jNWZYRHBpTDJQNlpLSXVhNldoWTByV2pTYlptT2Z4WTRzWS1JSlNtZzcwV3ljOHZadTU3d3g4cnNzRkd5eXBWVVNYTWRDNlhSU3AtLTdYNjFDczVBMWoxcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All adults should do at least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity or 150 minutes of moderate activity a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength training is recommended at least twice a week to help slow down the loss of lean muscle mass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical activity helps maintain independence in daily activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A group of 16 participants were gathered in a circle at the Murray Senior Recreation Center Tuesday morning, each with the necessary equipment, including a chair and dumbbells, as they followed their instructors through various exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As the participants practiced balancing on one foot, Cathy Jeffs laughed at herself as she struggled to balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The members of the class varied in age and ability but they all did their best to get a workout during the class. The oldest in the class, Verna Harshberger, who at 94 years old wasn’t able to do the standing exercises, modified those exercises for herself while sitting in her chair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jeffs said Harshberger inspires her to come to class because “if she can do it, so can I.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The class also had a few exercises that they had given nicknames to, such as “newspapers,” “sobriety test” and “Lisa’s gargoyle” which was named for another member of the class, Lisa Shadrieck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While doing the “sobriety test” exercise, where they have to step directly in front of their other foot, Shadrieck laughed and said that if any in the group ever actually have to do a sobriety test “we’ll all pass.

Thompson said that this can be helpful for attending family activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When my kids were young, my parents wanted to come see them play soccer, right? So they would have to park kind of a long way away from the soccer field and walk all the way to the soccer field,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/3HNTBUTQTVCYTIRTLVYJL2WLRA.JPG?auth=29d0accaba89b8b9dc31388aca78389abcfcc34348bd9fe5ffff6bb2866856f0&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/3HNTBUTQTVCYTIRTLVYJL2WLRA.JPG?auth=29d0accaba89b8b9dc31388aca78389abcfcc34348bd9fe5ffff6bb2866856f0&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;People participate in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="How-to-be-motivated-to-exercise-regularly" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;How to be motivated to exercise regularly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Staying motivated to exercise regularly can be hard sometimes, but there are a few things that people can do to help them have that motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Rebecca Davenport, the academic program manager for the exercise science, sports and fitness department at the University of Utah, said it is important for people to enjoy what they‘re doing when exercising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JNF6IIJL25EG5BZFCGYZRDBCIU.JPG?auth=31070aff457d260e5a5fa240007afe5054ef4494e7a86d4d26f5b997b037f2e8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JNF6IIJL25EG5BZFCGYZRDBCIU.JPG?auth=31070aff457d260e5a5fa240007afe5054ef4494e7a86d4d26f5b997b037f2e8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ron Liljegren participates in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Another thing to pull people in is find out what they do enjoy doing. Some people really love hiking. That‘s their jam. So go get them hiking, have them start there. Maybe they really love swimming,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Davenport added that exercising should be safe and it should be fun. If someone finds the activity that they‘re doing boring then they‘re not going to want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thompson said remembering why they‘re exercising and what it will help them be able to do can also help in motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“For a certain individual, it might be important that they are able to go to Disneyland with their family next year and be able to walk around,” Thompson said. “Another one might be being independent for a long period of time and not having to have someone take care of you.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Social support can also help people continue with an exercise habit, and this can come in many forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5WCCIFKZVBFFNCRCFMN367VG3U.JPG?auth=7894d2ae269439a0822b3b024ae546d033a8fabd96861c38dd81fbb9edbf8b6e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5WCCIFKZVBFFNCRCFMN367VG3U.JPG?auth=7894d2ae269439a0822b3b024ae546d033a8fabd96861c38dd81fbb9edbf8b6e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;People participate in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Signing up for exercise classes can provide motivation because of the commitment to the class and having other people in the class who make it enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The overall fitness class is a great example of this, Jeffs shared that she liked attending the class because she makes new friends and learns new exercises, adding that “everyone has been so nice.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jeffs first started attending classes at the recreation center after she came for help with her taxes and learned about all the resources the center had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I’m happy I came,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Mely Colotla, another regular attendee of the class who has been going for years, said likes going because she has fun and it helps her “feel good.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Another form of social support is finding a friend or family member to exercise with. “Just knowing that that person is going to be waiting for you to come to the gym can help you get out the door,” Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Recommendations-for-cardiovascular-exercise" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Recommendations for cardiovascular exercise &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Regular cardiovascular or aerobic exercise is important for all adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines/#:~:text=ACSM%20and%20CDC%20recommendations%20state,on%20three%20days%20per%20week." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines/#:~:text=ACSM%20and%20CDC%20recommendations%20state,on%20three%20days%20per%20week."&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recommends that all healthy adults get at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, or 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thompson gave examples of vigorous exercise: running, hiking and biking, just “something that‘s getting your heart rate up and you‘re working pretty hard.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/DWYHXETJIZFDXOP22ZEURAJJGY.JPG?auth=32a3f3b09f9d892103fdc7590ba9e1718fd5580d1b8ebdfa717b1bdecf85585c&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/DWYHXETJIZFDXOP22ZEURAJJGY.JPG?auth=32a3f3b09f9d892103fdc7590ba9e1718fd5580d1b8ebdfa717b1bdecf85585c&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;People participate in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“That might not be realistic for all folks, whether or not they are older,” she said, adding that the 150 minutes of moderate physical activity acts as a good alternative “could be like gardening or taking a walk around the neighborhood or a more leisurely bike ride.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thompson said that some of these activities, especially the ones that are outdoors such as hiking and taking walks, can help with emotional and mental health as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Recommendations-for-strength-training" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Recommendations for strength training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thompson said the &lt;a href="https://acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines/#:~:text=ACSM%20and%20CDC%20recommendations%20state,on%20three%20days%20per%20week." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines/#:~:text=ACSM%20and%20CDC%20recommendations%20state,on%20three%20days%20per%20week."&gt;ACSM&lt;/a&gt; recommends that adults do strength training at least two days a week. These strengthening exercises should also include every major muscle group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;These strength exercises can be done at home as body weight exercises, with dumbbells or bands, and can also be done at the gym. However, it is important to target each muscle group at least twice a week. It is also recommended to have a day of rest in between strength training days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/2Q2OASTXEJHNZKZX2IUNJR4JZY.JPG?auth=a72bc174646bd54c9f7a28968307bcd73e989a728f6d0504266c9ccdf0f16208&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/2Q2OASTXEJHNZKZX2IUNJR4JZY.JPG?auth=a72bc174646bd54c9f7a28968307bcd73e989a728f6d0504266c9ccdf0f16208&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Cheryl Schumer stretches after participating in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When it comes to deciding how long these strengthening sessions should be, Thompson said it is sort of a “pick your poison” type thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When someone is starting out, strength training should take around 30 to 45 minutes, Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Strength training is important to help slow down the loss of lean muscle, which starts for most people around age 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/LVVJ72WY5JE3BIX2XIT7VRV5XA.JPG?auth=269df95b43de059c1f2d686f055c7e66b102fc37333f30bb530408815b9090cb&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/LVVJ72WY5JE3BIX2XIT7VRV5XA.JPG?auth=269df95b43de059c1f2d686f055c7e66b102fc37333f30bb530408815b9090cb&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Frank Bradford participates in an overall fitness class targeted toward senior adults at the Murray City Senior Recreation Center in Murray on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Tess Crowley, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“In some cases, we can stop it completely, but not forever.

I add &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/chickpeas-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fiber-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;extra fiber&lt;/a&gt; and texture, as well as a good boost of plant-based protein. Feta brings even more protein, along with calcium and a salty kick. For the dressing, I mix thick, high-protein &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/greek-yogurt-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; with lemon juice, honey, mustard, olive oil, garlic, and herbs. It adds even more protein and makes the salad feel creamy and satisfying, without feeling heavy. This kind of salad has balance built in: protein from multiple sources, plenty of fiber, healthy fats, color, and it is properly filling. Some days I swap the chicken for tuna or shrimp. By the end, I have easily hit around 35g of protein without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am yet to meet a protein bar I really like. They are usually overly sweet, have a strange texture, and never leave me feeling properly satisfied. I would rather have something savoury and whole-food focused. One of my favourite go-tos at the moment is a thoughtful trail mix made of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/nut-protein" target="_blank"&gt;nuts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dinner&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dinner is where I like to bring in big flavors but still keep everything balanced. One of my favorites at the moment is my Thai prawn meatballs with a peanut and yogurt dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prawns are quick to cook, packed with lean protein, and work brilliantly in meatball form with lemongrass, garlic, and a little ginger. I serve them with a fresh cucumber and carrot salad, a handful of peas or shelled edamame, and that creamy peanut and yogurt dressing, which adds extra protein and healthy fats. I often add rice or noodles for some energizing carbohydrates, but the focus is always on building a plate with color, protein, and good texture. These meatballs also make amazing high-protein snacks and are great to batch-cook. Between the prawns, yogurt, and edamame, I am easily hitting around 35g of protein again. More importantly, it is a dinner that feels vibrant, fresh, and light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My final moment of the day is a cup of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://holycacao.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOooXTFE98-ZUWQtSEirI7Wfu9YbGBfdgwdKHs3nPP48KVPtlrOhO" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://holycacao.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOooXTFE98-ZUWQtSEirI7Wfu9YbGBfdgwdKHs3nPP48KVPtlrOhO"}' href="https://holycacao.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOooXTFE98-ZUWQtSEirI7Wfu9YbGBfdgwdKHs3nPP48KVPtlrOhO" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Holy Cacao&lt;/a&gt;, a collagen hot chocolate drink that has become one of my favorite evening rituals. I make it with organic whole milk and often whisk in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/drinking-collagen" target="_blank"&gt;a scoop of collagen&lt;/a&gt; for an extra skin-supporting, protein-rich boost. It is perfect for satisfying a sweet craving without sending my blood sugar crashing before bed, which can affect sleep. It is a gentle way to top up my protein, adding around 8g depending on how I make it, and it has made a real difference to my skin since becoming part of my routine. Topping up the collagen reserves before beauty sleep always feels like a small but powerful act of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 22:26:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNdDFrRFVMZlFPaFZFQ3NXUEpXQXA3Mkk2YS1GMmI4aXlnckFrNHRpSW5wNjRBdXliQXRvS1Zza21BUWRWcC13am1DbWMyQWRJUEpEQmdmQWpzelotSUVCVGwyNnJIR1V3eGZBcTNBMU9DbEdoXy1kUkJaOTFkZk1vTE9TZG9BZw</guid></item><item><title>关于侵入当地宾夕法尼亚州森林的入侵性蜱虫的知识- WHYY | What to know about the invasive tick that’s taking over local Pa. forests - WHYY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE0xaFZlY2NmX1hNZDZxVG8wd2tkdFJaTGtsZ0hjLVMzSENLWjBFaHRlQWx5RVYwcFdqYUZWU0p6NElHNDktTGVFQXFIeXZDb042SDBtRnh2clNHNlVtc2ZuWC1Scm0wbGkxR296amhoMzZZbTVqdGFBdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="flexible-content-container wysiwyg-styles"&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;p&gt;A big part of the reason they’ve managed to spread so quickly, Price said, is that they’re parthenogenetic, which means females are capable of reproducing asexually without the aid of male ticks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So the implications of this mean that a single individual female that lays around 2,000 to 2,500 eggs, all without mating, can create an entire population just by that individual,” Price said. “There’s no other tick in North America that reproduces in this manner. And it’s this unique reproductive strategy that enables the Longhorn tick to very successfully and very rapidly invade new geographic regions across the state and the country.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that migratory hosts, including white-tailed deer and black-capped night herons, are capable of carrying the ticks across vast distances, which also accounts for their rapid geographical spread.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential threats to public health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest questions researchers are asking about longhorned ticks is how much of a threat they pose to humans.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Past research out of Asia has found that longhorn ticks can carry a large variety of pathogens that affect human health.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s not 100% clear if it actually vectors those pathogens,” Phillips said. “So even if it has the bacteria or the virus inside of it, is it going to give it to you if it bites you? That’s not 100% clear. So that’s part of what we were trying to figure out in our research.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate that question, Phillips, along with Temple University ecologist Jocelyn Behm and undergraduate student Jackson Fahey, collected longhorned ticks from forested areas around the Philadelphia area, and tested them for pathogens. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39932861/"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; were good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of the ones that we collected carried any pathogens,” Phillips said. “So if you get bit by one around Philadelphia, you hopefully aren’t going to get a disease right away.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings match with other, previous rounds of testing that likewise found that longhorned ticks aren’t yet carrying some of the pathogens most dangerous to humans.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the end of the story. Price said that some of his lab’s current research has discovered multiple pathogens of human health concern in longhorned ticks collected from Pennsylvania parks and public use areas. Among the pathogens they found is the bacteria responsible for causing Lyme disease, though Price added that studies from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown that longhorned ticks are less likely to spread Lyme disease because the bacterium tends to be lost during their molting stage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Price said, the tick is so new that the role it plays in terms of disease transition remains largely uncertain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, past studies have found that longhorned ticks are capable of spreading several pathogens that can be found in Pennsylvania, including&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt; Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html"&gt; Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt;, a rare but serious disease that can cause encephalitis and meningitis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically with Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial agent responsible for Lyme disease, the tick has to be attached for 36 hours before that bacteria can be transferred through the bite to an individual,” Price said. “But with Powassan virus, it’s only about 15 minutes, and that’s just because the virus is maintained in the mouth parts and the salivary glands compared to the Lyme disease bacteria that’s maintained in the midgut of the tick.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price added that Phillips’ study helped demonstrate that there is significant overlap in habitat between longhorned ticks and local ticks, which provides a potential pathway for pathogens to be transmitted between the species.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also of concern is the fact that longhorned ticks are more aggressive in their pursuit of hosts and more likely to swarm than other ticks, as well as findings indicating that they’re more likely to be found in areas where local ticks typically don’t reside, like manicured lawns. They’ve also been found to affect domestic animals, like dogs, and can pose significant threats to livestock like cattle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, longhorned ticks can be protected against using the same methods recommended for local ticks, including keeping your skin covered, and the use of repellents approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, like permethrin.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the wide variety of fruit in our diet, one question persists: which is truly the most beneficial to our health? A study by William Paterson University in the United States provides a clear and surprising answer. According to their analysis, it is neither the apple nor the banana that comes out on top.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;A bomb of micronutrients in a small acidic fruit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared different varieties of fruit, taking into account the relationship between nutritional value and calorie intake. Lemons stood out for their concentration of vitamins (particularly vitamin C), fibre and powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1533399861"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A small amount of lemon is enough to provide a significant dose of beneficial compounds, making it a real concentrate of benefits. Its recognised effects include boosting the immune system, helping to absorb iron, improving digestion and even preventing cardiovascular disease, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/18/better-than-nordic-walking-this-old-peoples-sport-melts-fat-with-minimal-effort-even-after-60/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Better than Nordic walking: this “old people’s sport” melts fat with minimal effort (even after 60).&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;An acidic food… that alkalinises the body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact: although very acidic to the taste, lemons have an alkalinising effect once metabolised, helping to balance the body’s pH level. This action is beneficial for overall metabolism and also promotes better intestinal health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-4024188054"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers stress a point that is often overlooked: the acidity of lemons is not a disadvantage, but an advantage. It is directly linked to its vitamin C content, a key nutrient for immunity. “Its acidity is an ally of health, not an enemy”, they stress.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;How can you incorporate lemon into your daily routine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the acidic taste of lemon puts some people off, there are simple ways of incorporating it into your diet: a drizzle of juice in a salad, soup or glass of water, for example. The famous morning lemon water, often popularised on social networks, has also been scientifically validated.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts warn: avoid drinking pure lemon juice on an empty stomach too often, as its acidity can damage tooth enamel or irritate sensitive stomachs. It is preferable to dilute it in water, and to consult a health professional if you experience digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/02/nearly-60-years-ago-this-psychologist-discovered-the-7-38-55-rule-to-improve-emotional-intelligence/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Nearly 60 years ago, this psychologist discovered the 7-38-55 rule to improve emotional intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;And what about lime?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limes, also common in France, have many benefits. It is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, but has a slightly lower concentration of flavonoids (such as eriocitrin and hesperidin) than Sicilian lemons.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thicker lemon peel contains more essential oils (such as limonene), which have antioxidant, antimicrobial and even anticancer properties. Using a little zest in your dishes can further enhance its positive effects. All in all, lemons more than deserve their place in a balanced diet. Rich, low in calories and versatile.

The pharmaceutical industry likes to promote the latest shiny new medicine. That’s where the money is! Older medications that are available generically rarely get much support. Such seems to be the case for a drug called raloxifene (&lt;strong&gt;Evista&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evista was approved by the FDA in December 1997 for &lt;em&gt;preventing&lt;/em&gt; osteoporosis. In October of 1999 it got FDA’s green light for &lt;em&gt;treating&lt;/em&gt; osteoporosis. Then in 2007 the agency gave the Eli Lilly Company the right to market raloxifene to treat women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Lilly Company’s Enthusiasm About Evista (Raloxifene):&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘The FDA’s decision marks a major milestone. For the first time, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis will have one treatment option that can help address two leading health concerns — osteoporosis and invasive breast cancer,’ said Gwen Krivi, Ph.D., vice president of Lilly Research Laboratories. ‘Further, postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer will have an alternative therapy for invasive breast cancer risk reduction.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EVISTA, a selective estrogen receptor modulator or SERM (recently classified by the FDA as an estrogen agonist/antagonist), is already approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In July, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) to the FDA voted to recommend approval for the new uses. Today’s decision and the positive recommendation from ODAC were based on data submitted in November 2006 in a new drug application (NDA), evaluating clinical results from approximately 37,000 postmenopausal women that spanned nearly 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will shortly read how Eli Lilly and Company got into deep trouble with the Justice Department about breast cancer claims. But first, some background on this fascinating compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Did Raloxifene (Evista) Disappear Almost Without a Trace?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many women worry about breast cancer, especially if a relative is diagnosed with this challenging disease. Others fear weakened bones and fractures. These days many women get a bone mineral density (BMD) test (DXA or DEXA scan). It can reveal osteopenia (low bone density) or osteoporosis (weakened bones at increased risk for fractures). Once a test reveals a bone problem, doctors frequently prescribe women one of the many newer osteoporosis drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might imagine that a medication that does double duty in the fight against both breast cancer AND osteoporosis would have achieved a certain amount of staying power. That has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; been the case for raloxifene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last count, raloxifene does not register in the top 300 prescribed drugs in the US. That means it seems to have been mostly forgotten by both physicians and patients. Instead, doctors prescribe a different SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator) called tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer return after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options include aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole (&lt;strong&gt;Arimidex&lt;/strong&gt;), letrozole (&lt;strong&gt;Femara&lt;/strong&gt;) or exemestane (&lt;strong&gt;Aromasin&lt;/strong&gt;). Such medications are often prescribed after breast cancer surgery to prevent a recurrence. By the way, aromatase inhibitors may &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the chance a woman will develop osteoporosis and bone fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does Raloxifene Work to Prevent Breast Cancer AND Osteoporosis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the double-duty benefits of raloxifene you have to understand what a &lt;strong&gt;SERM&lt;/strong&gt; is. The idea that a drug could act as both an agonist &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an antagonist is, in my opinion, a bit challenging for health professionals to grasp. That’s where the term selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) comes from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One the one hand, raloxifene binds to estrogen receptors in bone. That means it is an “&lt;strong&gt;agonist&lt;/strong&gt;” in bone. By activating estrogen receptors in bone it increases bone mineral density, enhances bone strength and reduces the risk for vertebral fractures (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10730982/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;, Nov. 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raloxifene has the opposite effect on breast tissue, however. There it acts as an estrogen “&lt;strong&gt;antagonist&lt;/strong&gt;.” In other words, raloxifene blocks the effect of estrogen in the breast. Estrogen is a bit like fertilizer, especially for hormone-sensitive breast cancers. By blocking, or antagonizing, estrogen in the breast, the drug reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Uterine Cancer Comparison:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more tidbit about raloxifene vs. tamoxifen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because &lt;strong&gt;tamoxifen&lt;/strong&gt; acts like estrogen in the uterus, it can increase your risk of cancers of the uterus, including endometrial cancer and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/uterine-sarcoma.html"&gt;uterine sarc&lt;/a&gt;o&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/uterine-sarcoma.html"&gt;ma&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also linked to a higher risk of endometrial pre-cancers. The increased risk seems to affect women over 50, but not younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Raloxifene&lt;/strong&gt; does not act like estrogen in the uterus and is not linked to an increased risk of uterine cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Reader Shares Her Story with Raloxifene:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&lt;/strong&gt; My doctor prescribed raloxifene when I was in my 50s because my mother had died of breast cancer. She believed this drug would block estrogen from harming the breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must have worked, as I took it for 15 years without side effects and no bone problems. I stopped taking it then, on the grounds that there couldn’t be much estrogen left in my system. Eighteen months later I had a lumpectomy for an early tumor that was estrogen receptor positive. Get those mammograms!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; When raloxifene (Evista) was first introduced more than a quarter century ago, it was for preventing osteoporosis. It works differently from other common osteoporosis drugs, bisphosphonates like alendronate (&lt;strong&gt;Fosamax&lt;/strong&gt;) or ibandronate (&lt;strong&gt;Boniva&lt;/strong&gt;). That’s because it acts through estrogen receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly, raloxifene behaves in distinct ways depending on the tissues. The bones respond as if they are getting more estrogen–so they get stronger–while it blocks estrogen’s effects in the breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of 7700 postmenopausal women found that those taking raloxifene were much less likely to develop estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10376571/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, June 16, 1999&lt;/a&gt;). In 2007, the FDA approved it for breast cancer prevention in high-risk women like you. It blocks the activity of estrogen in the breast and is considered effective for reducing the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40275985/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncology Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, April 10, 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects include swollen legs or fingers, hot flashes, leg cramps and, most worrisome, blood clots. That’s why doctors are supposed to weigh benefits against risks before prescribing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/tamoxifen-and-raloxifene-for-breast-cancer-prevention.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; puts the blood clot risk into perspective:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both tamoxifen and raloxifene increase your risk of developing blood clots in a vein in your leg (deep venous thrombosis) or in your lungs (pulmonary embolism). These clots can sometimes cause serious problems, and even death. In the major studies looking at these drugs for breast cancer prevention, the overall risk of these blood clots over 5 years of treatment was less than 1%. This risk could be higher if you had a serious blood clot in the past, so these drugs are generally not recommended to lower breast cancer risk for anyone with a history of blood clots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lilly and the Law:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the FDA approved Evista for reducing the risk of breast cancer, the Eli Lilly and Company got severely spanked by the Department of Justice. Remember, the FDA did not give the company permission to market the drug against breast cancer until 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evista won approval for use against osteoporosis in December 1997, and Lilly put out a press release hyping the cancer-prevention angle–and drew fire from the FDA. Lilly then launched a $40 million ad blitz in 1998. The print and TV ads were supposed to tout only the osteoporosis claim, but the FDA later issued warning letters to Lilly for implying that Evista had won approval for preventing breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the spring of 1998 a swarm of press reports noted that new data showed Evista prevented breast cancer without tamoxifen’s downside, an increased risk of uterine cancer. Lilly helped fuel the coverage by releasing its results at a major cancer conference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“American pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company agreed to plead guilty and to pay $36 million in connection with its illegal promotion of its pharmaceutical drug Evista, the Justice Department announced today. In pleading guilty to a criminal count of violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by misbranding its drug Evista, the Indianapolis-based company agreed to pay a $6 million criminal fine and forfeit to the United States an additional sum of $6 million. In addition to the criminal plea, Lilly has agreed to settle civil Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act liabilities by entering into a consent decree of permanent injunction and paying the United States $24 million in equitable disgorgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evista is approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. As alleged in the information, under the provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a company must specify in its new drug application to the FDA labeling for all proposed intended uses for the drug. Once approved by the FDA, the drug may not be legally marketed or promoted for so-called ‘off-label’ uses – any use not specified in an application and approved by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The information alleges that the first year’s sales of Evista in the U.S. were disappointing compared to Lilly’s original forecast. According to the information, in October of 1998, the company reduced the forecast of Evista’s first year’s sales in the U.S. from $401 million to $120 million. An internal Lilly business plan noted that ‘Disappointing year versus original forecast.’ The information alleges that in order to expand sales of the drug, Lilly sought to broaden the market for Evista by promoting it for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The information alleges that Lilly’s strategic marketing plans and promotion touted Evista as effective in preventing and reducing the risk of diseases for which the drug’s labeling lacked adequate directions for use. According to the information, Lilly’s Evista brand team and sales representatives promoted Evista for the prevention and reduction in risk of breast cancer, and the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Under the provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Evista was misbranded when its labeling did not bear adequate directions for each of these intended uses. As alleged in the information, Lilly promoted Evista as effective for reducing the risk of breast cancer, even after Lilly’s proposed labeling for this use was specifically rejected by the FDA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The FDA Did Eventually Approve Evista (Raloxifene) for Breast Cancer Prevention:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here are the FDA’s permitted indications for Evista:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“• Treatment and Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“• Reduction in the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“• Reduction in the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about side effects, interactions and special precautions &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/braloxifene"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final Words About Raloxifene:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are neither advocates nor critics of this medication. We are somewhat surprised that most physicians have seemingly stopped prescribing raloxifene for osteoporosis and breast cancer prevention. Newer medications are far pricier. The price with a &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/raloxifene?c=homepage-lander-sem-7&amp;amp;optly_audience=%7Bnextbestaction%7D&amp;amp;utm_campaign=127243741&amp;amp;utm_content=7699746781&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term=kwd-54255549541&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=127243741&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_tHutvbBjQMVVDjUAR1fjR_GEAAYASAAEgJKzvD_BwE"&gt;GoodRx coupon&lt;/a&gt; is, at the time of this writing, about $69 for 90 tablets. That is a 3-month supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now many other medications for reducing the risk of osteoporosis. But they too have side effects.

In addition, she says, as you age or gain weight, you’re more vulnerable to a hiatal hernia, where the upper part of the stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm and into the chest cavity. Both stimulate acid reflux and heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CUGQEWLCVVHSTOCAY5GDVJ6UZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Many cases of heartburn can be eased with simple lifestyle strategies and short-term use of over-the-counter medications as needed,” says Michael S. Smith, a gastroenterologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X6TT5CNMXVEF3O3TWZESQ2CLQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But chronic heartburn — more than twice a week — can require more serious steps. That’s because it may signal a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), says Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In addition to heartburn, GERD can cause chest pain, a dry cough, shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing, and it can damage your esophagus or even raise your risk of esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="V7CUG5ISONDLFPF2GFXN2LCE54" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="V7CUG5ISONDLFPF2GFXN2LCE54" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Lifestyle changes&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6NMN33UHZE7RA6O3D3BT6IM2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/heartburn/lifestyle-changes-that-deliver-heartburn-relief-a8981533378/" target="_blank"&gt;Lifestyle measures&lt;/a&gt; can be quite effective at keeping heartburn at bay in the first place. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774728" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Harvard study published in JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that women who maintained a healthy body weight; didn’t smoke; got 30 minutes of exercise daily; limited coffee, tea and soda to no more than two cups a day; and ate a “prudent diet” — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fatty fish — were almost 40 percent less likely to develop new heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KNP7UAXPMJDW3OSFPKBUGD3BGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s wise to avoid lying down for two to three hours after you eat to prevent stomach acid from rising in your esophagus and causing heartburn. “I recommend patients elevate the head of their bed, which takes advantage of gravity to keep acid in your stomach,” says Jacob Kurlander, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. (Do this by placing a foam wedge at the head of your bed. Adding more pillows will elevate only your head and neck, which often isn’t effective.) And try sleeping on your left side, which keeps stomach fluid away from your esophagus, Qin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="THDHXXKBXZEMNORMKIRIISYE3E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="THDHXXKBXZEMNORMKIRIISYE3E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;For occasional heartburn&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F6DDJ3LFWRBQVJPIXTK72GT6UY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have heartburn once or twice a week, it’s generally fine to handle it on your own, Staller says. Start by looking at when it seems to occur. For some people, consuming things like caffeine, fatty food, chocolate, alcohol or peppermint may trigger it. “If you notice heartburn after you eat certain foods, try to avoid them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HTPBMOI2A5BSLN4UTNFN3ZTRMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To cool the burning sensation, you can try an over-the-counter antacid, such as calcium carbonate (Tums and generics) or aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide (Maalox and generics). “They work quickly to neutralize the acid in your stomach and esophagus,” Smith says. But the effects usually last only 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NZU24XMZZJBR7ORTGXTLT5USU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have heartburn primarily after eating and it tends to last longer than an hour, Smith recommends OTC drugs known as alginates.

They reduce the production of stomach acid, and their effect can last several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="WVBXAOD5CFHS5PJIEMNFTOIW4U" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="WVBXAOD5CFHS5PJIEMNFTOIW4U" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;When to see a doctor&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T3BRLQU665HFZOIVXVZIBT5EZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re over age 60 and have never had heartburn but suddenly do, see a doctor, even if your discomfort is only occasional. Your doctor may want to rule out inflammation, precancerous changes or esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24MNZUPXTFH27IGFX3VN4ZYKZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Do you have heartburn more than twice per week? It’s also wise to check in with your health-care provider, who may suggest a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). These are OTC or prescription-strength drugs such as lansoprazole (Prevacid and generic), esomeprazole (Nexium and generic) or omeprazole magnesium (Prilosec and generic) that block a pump in the stomach that produces stomach acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z5FUNPUEY5AB5JPPPQCIU47UUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Avoid lying down for two to three hours after you eat to prevent stomach acid from rising in your esophagus and causing heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OGAMQEEP4VH2FCXABEXQVZGQWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some research suggests a connection between long-term use of these drugs and bone fractures, serious infections and chronic kidney disease, although they’re not common side effects. Still, using them for a couple of weeks is usually safe, says Fouad Moawad, a gastroenterologist at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego and a spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association. And most of the research done so far on potential harm has been observational, which doesn’t prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YP4FIFCF3VFNVDWB5BAL2BT4LU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YP4FIFCF3VFNVDWB5BAL2BT4LU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Who needs meds long term?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HJRNAMLZWJCRNJ336LQZLWX6D4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you try a two-week course of PPIs and your symptoms don’t improve or they go away and then return, your doctor may want to do an endoscopy, Moawad says. In this procedure, a small, flexible tube with a camera on it is passed through your mouth into your esophagus to examine it closely for reflux-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EH7UYMKGWBCNZIFL2M2UUHAKD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you have severe reflux,” Staller says, “you may actually see an ulceration of your esophageal lining.” Your doctor may also want to take a tissue sample (a biopsy) to check for a condition called Barrett’s esophagus or even for esophageal cancer. Barrett’s esophagus, marked by damage to cells that line the esophagus, raises your risk for esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SW3QUGJEANAXDCREGCIBDG7OVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If we see damage to your esophagus, you will need long-term therapy to reduce your risk for more damage or even cancer,” Moawad says. In these cases, the benefits of an extended use of a PPI — indefinitely, if you have Barrett’s esophagus — outweigh the risks, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD47MLDTENECVG4DZU5KTYE26Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If testing reveals you have no esophageal damage from GERD but you continue to have frequent, severe heartburn, talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of using a PPI long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CY4T42QSFFBPBOGJEEU2AOKXD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your doctor may also suggest that you switch to the newer prescription acid blocker vonoprazan (Voquezna) for a number of weeks or even months. It’s effective at reducing stomach acid and relieving GERD-related heartburn symptoms, but Moawad says it may carry the same potential health risks as PPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SDRMU3DZRNEATOOIXZ6F5CFN6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whether you’re taking a PPI or Voquezna, your doctor should regularly check to determine whether you still need the drug or can be weaned off it. The American Gastroenterological Association advises that people take the lowest effective dosage for the shortest time possible. These meds are often used for longer than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CMMJXURLRNEF3ECG57FCTKFPAE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CMMJXURLRNEF3ECG57FCTKFPAE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;If you’re having trouble swallowing&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V3RNAMWW7BFFRIOVNQYGH4A6YY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Can you have reflux without the heartburn? It’s possible. Some older adults may have atypical or “silent” reflux, or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Symptoms can include a chronic sore throat or cough, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or “even the sense you’ve got something stuck in your throat,” says Kurlander. If you have any of these, testing to measure the amount of acid passing from your stomach into your esophagus can help determine whether reflux is the cause. Lifestyle steps like &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dieting-weight-loss/how-to-lose-weight-safely-a7419492212/" target="_blank"&gt;maintaining a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt; may help. If they don’t, your doctor may suggest a short course of meds to reduce acid production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.
