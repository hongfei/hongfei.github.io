                &lt;p&gt;A case of measles has been confirmed in an international traveler who recently arrived in D.C. and went through Dulles International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The D.C. Health Department is notifying people who were in the following locations who may have been exposed on the following dates and times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dulles, Concourse A, on transportation to the International Arrivals Building, and in the baggage claim area between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Sunday, June 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silver Line train from Dulles Airport Station, transferring at Metro Center Station to the Red line toward Shady Grove Station on June 8 from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Russian School of Mathematics, located at 8401 Connecticut Ave. in Chevy Chase, Maryland, on June 8 from 3 to 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L8 Metrobus southbound to Friendship Heights on June 8 from 5 to 7 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, a &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/05/2nd-case-of-measles-has-been-confirmed-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;second case of measles&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed in Virginia after the first measles case was &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-potential-measles-exposure-in-woodbridge-fredericksburg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed in the state in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is defined as “a highly contagious viral respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes,” DC Health said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the &lt;a href="https://dchealth.dc.gov/release/health-officials-investigation-measles-case-dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;city’s health department website&lt;/a&gt; for more information on how to protect yourself from this virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, there have been close to 1,200 confirmed measles cases this year, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/06/measles-outbreaks-in-michigan-and-pennsylvania-end-while-texas-logs-just-4-new-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. With the rise in measles cases, the CDC is urging all people traveling internationally to be &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/06/all-international-travelers-should-get-measles-vaccinations-cdc-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fully vaccinated against the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A craving for pizza. A full calendar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These may seem like harmless aspects of life - but a scientist has revealed how they could be putting you on the brink of developing cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raphael Cuomo, a University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-2aabf970-47bd-11f0-9eba-9977e10458cd" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, San Diego medical professor, claims chronic stress, fast food and alcohol and drugs are a near-surefire way to set yourself up for a cancer diagnosis later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his new book, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Crave: The Hidden Biology of Addiction and Cancer,&lt;/span&gt; the expert noted that the body's repetitive desire to indulge in junk food and addictive behaviors drives the body to the deadly condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor told DailyMail.com: 'Crave reveals how modern habits like vaping, binge-eating, and daily cannabis use hijack our biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These behaviors quietly damage the body's ability to repair itself. Over time, they open the door to cancer. It is not about genetics or bad luck. It is about the choices we make every day.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 600,000 Americans and more than 150,000 Brits &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12618499/How-cancer-shaves-14-YEARS-life-disease-robbing-time-1980s.html"&gt;die of various cancers every year.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2025, The American Cancer Society estimates there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7128469/22-MILLION-Americans-cancer-survivors-2030-experts-predict.html"&gt;are over 2million new cancer cases diagnosed annually&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After studying 'millions of patient records' from across the University of California hospitals and spending months reviewing studies on cancer biology, Dr Cuomo revealed what he says are the top habits most likely to cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 600,000 Americans and more than 150,000 Brits die of various cancers every year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Fast food &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert called eating fast food 'slow poison' - noting that its effects cannot be seen immediately but can cause long-term damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, researchers tested more than 300 foods sold at restaurant chains and in grocery stores across America for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14259969/fast-food-chains-toxic-microplastics-list.html"&gt;two microscopic toxins that have been linked to cancer, infertility and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that of all fast food restaurants, the salad chain Sweetgreen and Starbucks scored poorest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sweetgreen's Chicken Pesto Parm Salad and Starbucks' matcha latte was found to contain the highest amount of phthalates,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14210243/World-leading-scientist-reason-never-microwave-plastic-fertility-andrew-huberman.html"&gt; a group of chemicals used to make plastics&lt;/a&gt; more flexible and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Phthalates are commonly used in food packaging materials and s&lt;span&gt;tudies have shown they imitate the body's hormones and interfere with the production of - and response to - natural hormones like estrogen and testosterone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some phthalates have been linked to certain cancers, particularly breast cancer and lymphoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Cuomo pointed towards fiber consumption as a critical part of reversing damage as it can help improve gut bacteria, reduce inflammation and keep cells healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The expert called eating fast food 'slow poison' - noting that its effects cannot be seen immediately but can cause long-term damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Smoking and drinking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7547411/E-cigarette-smoke-gave-nearly-one-four-mice-lung-cancer.html"&gt;causes about 30 percent of overall cancer deaths in the US and is a leading cause of lung, brain, neck and bladder cancer.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk of several types of cancer, including breast, colon, liver and esophageal cancer. About 20,000 people die of alcohol-related cancers annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-7a530ef0-3c96-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9" class=""&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; found that a combination of drinking and smoking significantly raises the risk of colon cancer in young Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Raphael Cuomo, a University of California San Diego medical professor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They analyzed two dozen studies comparing regular drinkers and smokers to people who abstained from both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 100 cigarettes in a person's lifetime - the equivalent of one per week for two years - was linked to a 59 percent higher risk of colon cancer compared to people who have never smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found drinking &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-b01ef0d0-3caa-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; every day raised the risk of developing early-onset colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-b01f3ef0-3caa-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by 39 percent, even if it's just one or two drinks per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol and smoking have both been linked to cancer in the past, as they release chemicals that destroy DNA and cause cells to mutate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Cuomo noted that the body's repetitive desire to indulge in junk food and addictive behaviors drives the body to the deadly condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And each can of beer or glass of wine per day further increased the chance by an additional&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;two percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his book, the professor noted that deep sleep is the 'most underestimated tool' to improve damage caused by addictions, such as smoking and drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that during consistent deep sleep, the body performs critical tasks such as repairing tissues, regulating hormones, consolidating memory and clearing metabolic waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Stress &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week by a group of Chinese researchers noted that a combination of chronic stress and anxiety has been &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13933321/Scientists-discover-clue-colon-cancers-young-people.html"&gt;linked to colorectal cancer in young people&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They explained when a body is under frequent stress, a number of healthy bacteria that live in the gut start dying off, making it easier for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-6bb694c0-8800-11ef-a983-511f8cf9a8c1" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; to move in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When these bacteria die off, tumors grow more quickly, leading to more aggressive, rapidly growing colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research from &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9019120/"&gt;Trinity College in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has suggested these bacteria support the body's immune system, can protect against virus and bacteria and prevent damage in gut cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, chronic stress can lead to increased levels of cortisol and other stress hormones in the body that can promote cancer growth and its spread to various parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A constant state of stress can also weaken the immune system's ability to effectively fight off cancer cells.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Cuomo believes that there are ways to break free from all addictions and prevent cancer development in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'The real threat is not a single cocktail or slice of cake. It is the craving that drives you back again and again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That craving is what wears down your body’s defenses. I tell people to test their control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Start with one week of abstention. Not forever. Just seven days. That short reset reveals a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You learn what your body depends on. During that time, focus on physical recovery. Sleep deeply. Move your body. Eat real food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Spend time with people you trust. Addiction thrives in isolation. Recovery begins with reconnection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Dr Cuomo suggested engaging in some form of movement such as taking regular walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 00:53:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNdlB0ZDRlbHBhVHEzeWJjWHBWRW9pSUF6bmlFLUV2c3VSbkd1OFItcVhiRUlZNnRaMEw0Uk1OR2p1QU1xVFFYSmFDSEdpT05aRVZOcUdqWWdLZVJpRGZpN2NXRXd0MlpNbm1FN0VPVGRpOXVMZFQtTVcyMk5oaUNjQzRhY20tVDB4Z1hkOUR5ZVNseUZBVnVKMUFBS205QmhXLXpGN2hvbk1RR1pQRlpZ</guid></item><item><title>维生素D缺乏可能导致的5种健康问题-印度时报 | 5 health issues that can occur due to Vitamin D deficiency - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxQeFZVZzZCZHc3NzhoNDlRQ1JEcEFkWnpucGFMV0VzTnNYREVTYmNMR3ByZ0M5UkhoZFJ1WktGQXJkVXJkOWFGN1pOVDRoMS1EeTBhMlpYSmpEZ1JybnQ3blFGaTlmM3JlWTZ0Y3BfeWdyMU5oZ3FYOGRNdU1pOTlONVEtT05tRGJUNWtCTmNZN3VnYXZQQU9RYkpGb0VYM3RiQkQ5TW80X3Jram5MNVl1VWdmSmROSGMtQk12TmMtRi1jSThDdUZ0aFY2NG5mTG9ZZXc1VS0tQjE3Qi1BYk80Mk9yYmRMRTZnb0owNU1n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, which are important to build strong bones. Without enough vitamin D, your body cannot absorb these minerals properly. This can lead to soft, weak bones that are more likely to break or hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children, severe vitamin D deficiency causes a condition called rickets, which though rare, causes the bones to become soft and often leading to bowed legs. In adults, this condition is called osteomalacia, which causes bone pain and muscle weakness. People with low vitamin D may also develop osteoporosis, a disease where bones become fragile and brittle, increasing the risk of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxQeFZVZzZCZHc3NzhoNDlRQ1JEcEFkWnpucGFMV0VzTnNYREVTYmNMR3ByZ0M5UkhoZFJ1WktGQXJkVXJkOWFGN1pOVDRoMS1EeTBhMlpYSmpEZ1JybnQ3blFGaTlmM3JlWTZ0Y3BfeWdyMU5oZ3FYOGRNdU1pOTlONVEtT05tRGJUNWtCTmNZN3VnYXZQQU9RYkpGb0VYM3RiQkQ5TW80X3Jram5MNVl1VWdmSmROSGMtQk12TmMtRi1jSThDdUZ0aFY2NG5mTG9ZZXc1VS0tQjE3Qi1BYk80Mk9yYmRMRTZnb0owNU1n</guid></item><item><title>研究揭示了您每周需要进行多少运动来控制血压- ScienceAlert | Study Reveals How Much Exercise You Need Each Week to Control Blood Pressure - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQRUdPVThTbjdaQTNhTzhGOHRHbmRDNDBnQ0hCMUR0WU1NdlV0LUhYRzVZQmFDRDZnUEtPbkNCZFRUR3BBN040Q0x0VnI5Qmp2eVBHU2hHSnM5N3VmajVNYmtHSHo3Mk9hRTdVUEZ3Z0RkOVNJN20zYjE0OGhxRzllX3FEUi0wRjVPQ2x0ZzNfdS1WQXF6MWI2MUdPRFFzNkpqVmJlN1FHUVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;When it comes to exercising for heart's sake, you don't want to peak too early in life. Research suggests that if you want to protect yourself against high blood pressure in your twilight years you need to keep your exercise levels up through middle age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;But according to a study of more than 5,000 people across four US cities, social factors can make this more difficult for some people to do than others.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;"Teenagers and those in their early 20s may be physically active but these patterns change with age," study author and epidemiologist Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in April 2021, when the study was published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Numerous studies have shown that exercise lowers blood pressure, but the 2021 research suggests that "maintaining physical activity during young adulthood – at higher levels than previously recommended – may be particularly important" for preventing hypertension," Bibbins-Domingo &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_96226" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96226" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-642x260.jpg" alt="Older man running on street wearing orange t-shirt." class="wp-image-96226 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-96226" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maintaining physical activity could be even more important than we knew.

Adults who followed a low-carbohydrate diet that emphasized plant-based proteins, unsaturated fats, and fewer refined carbohydrates were significantly less likely to experience symptoms of depression. On the other hand, low-carb diets high in animal protein and saturated fats showed no such benefits. These findings point to the importance of food quality, not just quantity, in shaping mood and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are a major source of energy in the human diet, but their role in mental health has been debated. Low-carbohydrate diets—often adopted for weight loss or metabolic health—reduce carbohydrate intake and compensate with higher protein and fat intake. While some studies have found that these diets improve symptoms of depression, others have reported no clear link or even suggested possible risks. One factor that may explain these conflicting results is that researchers have not always distinguished between high-quality and low-quality sources of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers in China conducted a large cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative health survey of U.S. adults. They wanted to determine whether the type of low-carbohydrate diet someone follows—healthy or unhealthy—affects the likelihood of experiencing depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 28,791 U.S. adults aged 20 and older who participated in NHANES between 2005 and 2018. Participants were excluded if they had incomplete dietary data, implausible calorie intake, missing depression assessments, or missing background information such as education or health history. The final sample included a wide range of demographic groups, with information collected through interviews, physical exams, and two-day dietary recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate how closely participants followed low-carbohydrate diets, the researchers created three types of dietary scores. The overall low-carbohydrate diet score (OLCD) was based on the total intake of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. A higher score meant lower carbohydrate intake and higher intake of fats and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also created two specific variations: the healthy low-carbohydrate diet score (HLCD) and the unhealthy low-carbohydrate diet score (ULCD). The HLCD emphasized plant-based proteins, unsaturated fats, and minimal low-quality carbohydrates like refined grains and added sugars. In contrast, the ULCD emphasized animal proteins, saturated fats, and reduced intake of healthy carbohydrates like fruits, legumes, and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression symptoms were assessed using a widely accepted questionnaire known as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This tool asks participants about feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and other mood-related experiences over the past two weeks. A total score of 10 or more is considered to indicate significant symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the relationship between diet and depression, the researchers used statistical models that adjusted for a variety of factors, including age, sex, race, education, body weight, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and existing health conditions like diabetes or heart disease. They also tested whether replacing certain foods with healthier alternatives would impact depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that individuals with higher HLCD scores—those who ate fewer refined carbs and more plant-based proteins and healthy fats—had significantly lower odds of experiencing depressive symptoms. Specifically, people in the highest category of the HLCD were about 30% less likely to report depression symptoms compared to those in the lowest category. In contrast, people with higher ULCD scores showed no meaningful difference in depression risk compared to those with low scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall low-carbohydrate diet score (OLCD) also showed a weak association with lower depression symptoms, but the effect was less consistent and disappeared at the highest levels. The dose-response analysis suggested that moderate adherence to a low-carbohydrate diet was more beneficial than extreme restriction. When low-quality carbohydrates were replaced with plant-based or even animal-based proteins, participants were less likely to report depression symptoms, highlighting the potential role of nutrient substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored whether specific groups might benefit more from healthier low-carb diets. Results remained consistent across subgroups based on age, gender, race, marital status, and lifestyle factors like exercise or smoking. Sensitivity analyses that accounted for antidepressant use also supported the main findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for the link between healthy low-carb diets and reduced depression symptoms involves inflammation and oxidative stress. Diets high in added sugars and saturated fats can increase inflammation in the body, which has been linked to depression. In contrast, diets rich in nutrients like B vitamins, folate, and tryptophan—found in many plant-based foods—may support brain function by aiding neurotransmitter production, including serotonin. These dietary patterns may also improve gut health, metabolic function, and sleep, all of which influence mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key takeaway from the study is that not all low-carbohydrate diets are equal. A diet low in carbohydrates but high in processed meats, saturated fats, and lacking in plant-based foods may not support mental health. Simply reducing carbohydrate intake, without considering the source and quality of the remaining nutrients, is unlikely to provide psychological benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths—including a large, nationally representative sample and a nuanced analysis of dietary patterns—the study has limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, it cannot prove cause and effect. It’s possible that people with depression eat differently because of their symptoms, rather than diet causing those symptoms. Dietary intake was self-reported and only measured over two days, which may not capture long-term habits. There may also be errors in how foods were categorized, despite efforts to minimize subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should follow participants over time to confirm whether these dietary patterns can prevent depression or reduce symptoms in people who are already struggling. Clinical trials that test specific dietary interventions, using more accurate tracking methods, would help clarify the underlying mechanisms and strengthen the evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2025.03.013" target="_blank"&gt;Low-carbohydrate diet macronutrient quality and depression symptoms among US adults&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Chengxiang Hu, Beibei Han, Yue He, Rong Huang, Xiaoting Fan, Jia Lan, Yanan Ma, and Lina Jin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPV1Y4UDI2ZURndW1HalUydnFJYUlOWDlFZVhfT19nbW43RnNvdVY4NFZ1eEZ0N1JVckl0R2Z6TVVNT1FWeXNGZV9qNFdxUm51WmxBb0trdjdsQWpnQ2M0bF9GMHdNVHVrSUwtVlBwc0M1N1FDU0pzUF9PbmlYaUU3elZtVGFIT0xUeVo1YlJGbHdmeTZxcUhjSVZoRVc</guid></item><item><title>麻疹传染者到访波士顿公共场所-波士顿环球报 | Person contagious with measles visited Boston public spaces - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOd2EwS3ppa1JXV2o2eGVBMkc4elpUWEtOZURtNU1wX0o3cDlEeHRwcGtsemdSUk9kSWVtcjhzWXR0VGdNNWVXRTFiM1Y4RXlxUzlRdWFHZ09uWUdUT3hMdnhKeHF2Y0JaZHdIQUJLVkh0QV9YTjAtc2g5eFRsT1hVUWVVSno?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="article | rail"&gt;&lt;div class="lead | border_box gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet relative"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A traveler contagious with measles visited multiple public places in Boston from June 7-8, health officials said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Boston Public Health Commission and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed the person visited a hotel, a museum, and Logan Airport. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The agencies are warning that people who were at any of these locations at these times may have been exposed to measles: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

Scientists studied neural networks in the auditory cortex and found that although sound-processing patterns were briefly disrupted, the brain formed nearly identical patterns within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons previously uninvolved in processing stimuli stepped in to compensate for the loss. This adaptive mechanism could help explain how the brain maintains function during aging or in diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Reorganization:&lt;/strong&gt; Neural networks re-establish activity patterns just days after neuron loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Compensation:&lt;/strong&gt; Unused neurons can adapt to take over the roles of lost cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; May explain brain resilience in aging and neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the brain largely maintains its function when neurons are lost—this is what researchers at the University Medical Center Mainz, the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS) and Hebrew University (Jerusalem) have deciphered. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They show that neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex reorganize within a short period of time, with other nerve cells taking over the tasks of the lost neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110922"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/neuron-rewiring-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nerve cells (neurons) are the most important building blocks of the brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings could form the basis for future research into natural aging processes and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve cells (neurons) are the most important building blocks of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They form the basis for all mental and physical functions such as thinking, feeling, movement, and perception. In the course of life, nerve cells in the brain can be lost for various reasons: They die off due to age-related processes, are damaged by toxins such as alcohol, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s lead to a more rapid progressive loss of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most body organs regularly replace old or damaged cells with new ones in order to maintain their organ function, new neurons only form in certain regions of the brain. In the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for complex thought processes and perception, the ability to form new neurons is very limited in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, clinical studies have shown that cortical brain function is often surprisingly resistant to the loss of neurons that occurs in the course of aging or neurodegenerative diseases,” explains Simon Rumpel, head of the Systems Neurophysiology research group at the Institute of Physiology at the University Medical Center Mainz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, it was not known how the brain can compensate for the loss of nerve cells and maintain its function. To find this out, the research team used an animal model to investigate the neuronal networks in the auditory cortex, which is responsible for processing acoustic stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perception of sounds is based on activity patterns that are triggered in the brain by acoustic stimuli. These patterns are very complex. Ph.D. student Bastian Eppler and Senior Fellow Matthias Kaschube at FIAS contributed significantly to the analysis of these data and the interpretation of the results with their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the activity patterns initially destabilize when the loss of a few specific nerve cells is deliberately induced. This indicates that the neuronal network responsible for sound perception is in a delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After just a few days, very similar activity patterns form again. The nerve cells that were not previously activated by the acoustic stimuli now acquire the ability to take the place of the lost neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We assume that this newly discovered neuronal mechanism plays an important role in the loss of nerve cells in natural aging processes as well as in neurodegenerative diseases,” says Rumpel. Future research efforts could aim to support this neuronal reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://startseite.uni-mainz.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simon Rumpel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://startseite.uni-mainz.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Simon Rumpel – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01982-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Homeostasis of a representational map in the neocortex&lt;/a&gt;” by Simon Rumpel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeostasis of a representational map in the neocortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical function, including sensory processing, is surprisingly resilient to neuron loss during aging and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this Article, we used the mouse auditory cortex to investigate how homeostatic mechanisms protect the representational map of sounds after neuron loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We combined two-photon calcium imaging with targeted microablation of 30–40 sound-responsive neurons in layer 2/3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microablation led to a temporary disturbance of the representational map, but it recovered in the following days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery was primarily driven by neurons that were initially unresponsive to sounds but gained responsiveness and strengthened the network’s correlation structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, selective microablation of inhibitory neurons caused prolonged disturbance, characterized by destabilized sound responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results link individual neuron tuning and plasticity to the stability of the population-level representational map, highlighting homeostatic mechanisms that safeguard sensory processing in the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 21:29:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE1QSUpQY2dFU2RicWR3NW5EZ0w1cDNFSVdJQTdDS1lwWXVtaHhLZE50U2Rwc0ZzektWNjdJMzAtSHNWWThDMkxrWUJWM29qRGZ2TjB4M3o0TVlJcWxkSFNjcHJrYm0ySUlBQkE</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现，狗可以提醒人类注意这种快速传播的疾病- Earth.com | Scientists discover that dogs can alert humans to this quickly-spreading disease - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxONFBEWVdFMndNT3YyN0VVRWFFbTVkOGlsNDNVRHl3Nk1STnplcUtMRmI2VzVRcDctWDBqWTdENkk2Q2E0Q1cxcVRybDRpaDdZOE5EXy12cU9iajYtWWVIeVlvVWdBbXF6MGRzOEdIWlQ3bHB6S1NFQjJHSGxBT0hqSWxGLXU0eWdXVDlsbDh6b3l6Y2F3WVdrWWJUS3FsSVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs aren’t just companions who brighten our daily routines. They may also be key players in monitoring how Valley fever moves through certain regions in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disease, also called coccidioidomycosis, involves inhaling fungal spores found in dry soil conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/jane-sykes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jane Sykes&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of a recent &lt;a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Davis&lt;/a&gt; study, worked with her team to see how information from dog infections could apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-valley-fever"&gt;Understanding Valley fever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When disturbed by wind, construction, or agricultural activity, the spores of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/coccidioides-immitis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coccidioides immitis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/coccidioides-posadasii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coccidioides posadasii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can ride on dust particles and travel into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pets like to dig into dirt, creating an ideal chance to breathe in fungal particles. These Valley fever spores thrive in the Western parts of the country, often in places with specific soil moisture levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though many people who are exposed may not experience symptoms, those who do often report flu-like illness, including fatigue, cough, fever, chest pain, and muscle aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems, Valley fever can become severe, spreading from the lungs to other parts of the body such as the skin, bones, joints, or even the brain, where it may cause &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/harmful-microbes-persist-on-hospital-surfaces-after-disinfection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis is typically confirmed through blood tests or imaging, and while mild cases often resolve without treatment, antifungal medications like fluconazole are prescribed for moderate to severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unusual-canine-clues"&gt;Unusual canine clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered patterns by checking large collections of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lost-in-translation-how-we-misread-our-dogs-emotions/"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; blood tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that most positive results are linked to certain states with known contamination zones, but they also noticed smaller clusters appearing in locations not typically flagged for this infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dogs are sentinels for human infections,” said Jane Sykes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her team collected blood test data in different areas to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;identify rising trends&lt;/a&gt; and potential health concerns for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-puts-dogs-at-risk"&gt;What puts dogs at risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vets &lt;a href="https://vfce.arizona.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; that certain breeds may be more prone to lung ailments, but any fungus exposure can be an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might involve dusty backyards, fields, or construction sites, where spores in the soil can become airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regions with droughts or strong winds, soil dryness allows fungal particles to swirl into the air. Intense rainfall can also boost &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/dangerous-airborne-fungus-boosted-by-california-droughts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fungal growth&lt;/a&gt;, which further contributes to sporadic spikes in infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers see these canine cases as indicators for possible spread in the broader population. Common symptoms in people include fatigue, cough, and sometimes sore joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies note that valley fever can become serious for those with weakened immune systems. Because dogs are tested more readily in certain regions, their results may warn us before human cases spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mapping-valley-fever-in-new-zones"&gt;Mapping valley fever in new zones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have spotted positive &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/uncovering-the-truth-the-reality-behind-canine-dna-testing/"&gt;canine&lt;/a&gt; cases outside historically recognized areas. Jane Sykes explained that pockets of infection can appear in nearby states that might be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should be closely watching those states because there could be under-recognition,” she said. This under-recognition means some doctors in these regions may not be aware of the disease and could miss early signs in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of shifting &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;climate patterns&lt;/a&gt; have altered soil conditions. Over 130 places in the United States have recorded heavier bursts of rain in recent years, raising concerns about potential fungal growth when storms finally soak the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new weather extremes develop, the fungus might have more opportunities to spread. Researchers keep emphasizing how environmental changes can shift the boundaries of diseases, leading to surprises in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-virus-can-remain-in-sperm-months-after-infection/"&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-yourself-and-your-pet"&gt;Protecting yourself and your pet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many dog owners wonder if this infection is preventable. Avoiding areas with visible dust clouds is one measure, though it can be tough when your pet loves running outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30690600/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vets&lt;/a&gt; provide guidance on ways to limit exposure if your area is known for this fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these spores are hard to avoid entirely, regular checkups and early tests may help pets and owners stay aware of new health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterinarians who live in spots with many valley fever cases watch for respiratory problems in dogs. A sudden cough or limp can signal hidden issues, prompting tests that reveal infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If caught early, there are antifungal treatments that can relieve symptoms. The goal is to manage lung damage and reduce further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-valley-fever-and-the-future"&gt;Dogs, valley fever, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers who track these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-infection-equips-the-body-to-fight-off-the-flu/"&gt;infections&lt;/a&gt; see a bigger picture beyond local hotspots. They hope more states will gather accurate data so public health teams can warn residents who may be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better knowledge about where the spores hide allows for timely alerts. Clear communication between veterinarians and medical professionals could help limit the toll on both animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trends linked to heavy rain, population growth, and soil changes highlight the complexity of valley fever. Officials suggest that improved teaching for doctors could keep illness from going unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs may help identify emerging dangers because their health data can fill the gaps where human data are patchy. Scientists remain hopeful that continued studies will keep the public informed about this evolving fungal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/231/5/e986/8108831?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 18:13:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxONFBEWVdFMndNT3YyN0VVRWFFbTVkOGlsNDNVRHl3Nk1STnplcUtMRmI2VzVRcDctWDBqWTdENkk2Q2E0Q1cxcVRybDRpaDdZOE5EXy12cU9iajYtWWVIeVlvVWdBbXF6MGRzOEdIWlQ3bHB6S1NFQjJHSGxBT0hqSWxGLXU0eWdXVDlsbDh6b3l6Y2F3WVdrWWJUS3FsSVk</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，有问题的色情使用随着时间的推移保持稳定，并与精神痛苦密切相关- PsyPost | Problematic porn use remains stable over time and is strongly linked to mental distress, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxPSnJheFl5dTdHTkRHZ1dGb0M2dTludGJFWjh2V0g4MjZPajBaWDNOd1V6d01yN1dqRmFNbnFXbkZZWHg1SnBfQVB5TVJJWHhBZE1EVGlmUmdPb0FLVDlTZ2hsR2xfV3gxUjlqUFhZMG5ULWJtekdNOWNVTUZFMWx6Qm1fQ3UwMFl6cjJwMWRTTjNjbkVqeldHRG45R1AzclNvd1RuQlpKNklrQ2t4d3l3NFRrS0l4cHhWbGdfOHVkWmJIUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new longitudinal study has found that problematic pornography use tends to remain stable over time and is strongly associated with psychological distress such as anxiety and depression. The findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Addictive Behaviors&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that while some people may experience short-term relief from distress through pornography use, long-term patterns of dysregulation are tied to more persistent psychological difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pornography is widely used in the United States and globally, but for some individuals, it can become problematic. People who experience problematic pornography use often report difficulty controlling their use and suffer negative consequences in their personal, professional, or emotional lives. The condition has recently gained clinical recognition under the diagnostic label of Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder in the World Health Organization’s latest classification system. Despite this recognition, little research has explored how problematic pornography use develops and changes over time, especially in relation to mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Engelhardt of Bundeswehr University, the lead author, was motivated by “the necessity to scientifically catch up in this field. Previous studies depicted comparatively high prevalence rates of problematic pornography use and associations with psychological distress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a one-year, three-wave longitudinal study of over 4,300 U.S. adults. They wanted to examine how problematic pornography use and psychological distress influence each other over time and whether these patterns are stable or fluctuate. Their work builds on previous research that identified a link between pornography dysregulation and psychological distress but could not determine whether one causes the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited through a national polling company and included a combination of a general population sample and an oversample of sports bettors to increase statistical power. The final sample included 4,363 individuals between the ages of 18 and 96, with an average age of 50 and a gender distribution of roughly equal numbers of men and women. The study took place over three timepoints: March-April 2022, September-October 2022, and March-April 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess problematic pornography use, the researchers used the Brief Pornography Screen, a five-item questionnaire designed to measure symptoms of dysregulation, such as difficulty resisting urges or using pornography in ways that cause distress. A score of 4 or higher on this measure was considered a potential indicator of problematic use. Psychological distress was measured through widely used tools for assessing anxiety and depression: the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The researchers combined responses from both scales into a single composite reflecting overall distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that problematic pornography use was highly consistent across time. Correlations between timepoints were strong, and most participants remained in the same clinical category—either below or above the threshold for potential problematic use—throughout the year. About 67% of participants consistently scored below the clinical threshold, while 14% consistently scored above it. Only a small proportion moved between categories, indicating either recovery or the development of problematic use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological distress was also stable across timepoints, and the researchers found a strong positive association between pornography dysregulation and distress at the level of individuals. That is, people who tended to score higher on pornography problems also tended to report more distress, and vice versa. This suggests a stable, trait-like relationship between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when the researchers examined how changes in one variable might predict changes in the other over time, the results were more nuanced. They found small, negative within-person effects: when an individual experienced an increase in pornography dysregulation at one time point, they were slightly less likely to report increased psychological distress six months later. The reverse was also true. This pattern was unexpected, as many theories in psychology predict that distress and problematic behaviors reinforce one another over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers offered a few potential explanations for this finding. One possibility is that pornography use may provide temporary relief from emotional distress, functioning as a short-term coping strategy. People experiencing anxiety or depression may turn to pornography for distraction or mood regulation, which could lead to a slight reduction in distress in the short run. However, over time, this pattern may backfire, leading to a worsening of dysregulation and deepening of psychological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interpretation centers on the effects of depression itself. Depression can dampen a person’s general motivation and reduce interest in activities, including sexual ones. This might result in lower pornography use during depressive episodes, even among people with a history of dysregulation. In this way, depression could inhibit some of the behavioral patterns associated with problematic pornography use, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these small short-term effects, the dominant pattern was one of a strong and consistent link between problematic use and psychological distress across individuals. This means that, in general, people who have more difficulty regulating their pornography use are also more likely to struggle with anxiety and depression. These findings echo previous research and align with the idea that both problematic pornography use and psychological distress can reinforce each other in the long term, even if their moment-to-moment dynamics are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide evidence of “a trait-like connection between problematic pornography use and psychological distress,” Engelhardt told PsyPost. “They appear to be the same construct — problematic pornography use appears a part of psychological distress and psychological distress a part of problematic pornography use. However, cross-sectional studies may not depict this underlying strong time-consistent association due to small time-dependent inhibition effects that let the association appear smaller.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several important strengths, including its large sample size, use of validated measurement tools, and robust statistical modeling techniques that distinguish between stable traits and temporary fluctuations. However, the authors caution that the findings are based on self-report data, which can be influenced by social desirability or memory biases. Additionally, the study focused on dysregulation rather than the frequency of pornography use, which could be an important factor in understanding how and why pornography affects mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research, the authors suggest, should investigate these dynamics in clinical populations and over longer periods. They also recommend using more fine-grained, daily tracking methods to examine short-term interactions between distress and pornography use in real-world settings. Experimental studies could also help clarify whether reducing pornography use leads to improved mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “Problematic pornography use and psychological distress: A longitudinal study in a large US sample,” Robin Engelhardt, Rahel Geppert, Joshua B.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, gut health is also important for disease prevention and management. “Given the microbiome is responsible for the inflammatory response, it’s crucial to optimize your gut health to prevent chronic inflammation that can occur in diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes,” says &lt;a href="https://bethrosenrd.com/meet-beth/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beth Rosen, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Beth Rosen Nutrition. “Plus, a balanced microbiome can help to reduce constipation, diarrhea, gas and bloating in digestive disease diagnoses,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-health-benefits-of-mint"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Health Benefits of Mint  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This small but mighty herb packs a flavorful punch of nutrition in every bite. According to gut-health experts, mint is the No. 1 herb you need to add to your eating plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But, just why is this popular flavor in toothpaste and chewing gum so stellar when it comes to gut health? Mint has properties that help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stomach cramping and can kill harmful microorganisms, says Wong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mint is the general term given to the family of plants that exhibit that minty-fresh feeling you’ve come to know. While two of the most common forms of mint you’ve likely encountered include spearmint and peppermint, the latter is the one most frequently encountered when you hear mint and gut health combined. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research has found that peppermint oil, for example, can help relieve digestive discomfort in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;people who have IBS&lt;/a&gt;, as well as quell indigestion—and it’s been shown to be safe to use for short-term relief.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Mint’s antispasmodic properties help relax the muscles of the digestive tract, while its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects promote a balanced gut environment,” says Wong. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is worth noting that doses used in research don’t exactly translate to the same mint we’d use in a kitchen. Meaning you can’t expect a leaf of mint to alleviate symptoms associated with IBS overnight. However, drinking mint tea has been used to alleviate stomach pain and nausea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are interested in using something stronger, like peppermint oil, talk to a healthcare professional before using supplements to make sure they’re safe for you. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mint is a great choice, but it’s not the only herb that bodes well for your GI tract. “Other herbs like ginger, turmeric and fennel also offer substantial benefits. It’s essential to adopt a holistic approach, incorporating a variety of herbs and foods to support overall gut health,” says Wong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-including-mint-in-a-healthy-eating-pattern"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for Including Mint in a Healthy Eating Pattern &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding fresh mint into a healthy eating pattern doesn’t require a trip to a specialist. “While using fresh mint leaves may not reproduce the same effects seen in clinical trials, it still adds a refreshing flavor to dishes,” says Wong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, Wong recommends clients use three to five fresh mint leaves in recipes. “This amount is a good starting point for adding freshness and a mild digestive benefit to their meals,” says Wong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rosen agrees, adding that peppermint can also be steeped as a tea. One thing to keep in mind is being careful with mint if you have acid reflux. Mint can be a trigger for GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), especially if you consume a lot of it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Understanding how mint affects you will be important for deciding how to include it in your eating plan. “While this may irritate those with GERD, for others it can help alleviate indigestion and nausea,” says Wong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get you started on your journey using mint in your own kitchen, first and foremost, store it properly. This can be done on the counter or in the fridge, as long as you follow these tips for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835019/how-to-store-fresh-mint/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;storing fresh mint&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mint is a powerful herb that has shown to have beneficial properties that bode well for gut health. Not only is it easy to toss into recipes during the summer months, it’s also a wonderful flavor enhancer to upgrade water. Consider stocking up on fresh mint and other herbs and spices during your next grocery haul and, we promise, your gut will thank you.&lt;br&gt;

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Creatine is finally garnering the recognition it deserves. After years of being regarded as a bulking supplement used exclusively by gym bros and bodybuilders (my mom, one of the latter, has been taking it daily for years), those focused on muscle mass are finally incorporating the naturally occurring substance into their everyday supplement regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;â€œWhile itâ€™s true that historically, creatineâ€™s primary use was as an athletic or bodybuilding supplement, research is now showing that it can profoundly impact the brain and neurological health,â€� says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/myersdetox/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.instagram.com/myersdetox/?hl=en"&gt;Dr. Wendy Myers, MD&lt;/a&gt;. â€œStudies show that creatine improves energy metabolism in the brain, which can have several positive downstream effects, including &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38297476/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38297476/"&gt;protecting against neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, improving focus, enhancing memory, and supporting overall mental stamina.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Muscle is having a momentâ€”thanks to its ties to longevity and metabolismâ€”but creatineâ€™s rep hasnâ€™t fully caught up. While its muscle-building benefits still lead the charge, skepticism lingers, especially among women who equate it with bulking. But, according to experts, creatine may even be more important for women than for men. â€œCreatine has a long-standing reputation as a supplement for bodybuilders, but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33800439/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33800439/"&gt;new research &lt;/a&gt;shows it could be one of the most important tools for women navigating perimenopause, menopause, and postpartum recovery,â€� Dr. Meyers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="conversion-card conversion-card-extended"&gt;&lt;p class="conversion-card__description"&gt;In addition to five grams of creatine monohydrate, Arraeâ€™s Tone Gummies also contain the brandâ€™s proprietary Slimbiotics blend and ginger extract, which helps support the gut while combatting bloat, aiding digestion, and further supporting your body composition goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sadly, most creatine supplements on the market come in the form of chalky, bitter powders you have to chug to get down, which is kind of a dealbreakerâ€”especially if youâ€™re already on the fence about incorporating it into your ever-expanding supplement lineup (I get it). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Before I discovered &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies"&gt;Arraeâ€™s Tone Gummies&lt;/a&gt;, I was adding my creatine powder to water and taking it down like a shot. Iâ€™ve been a fan of Arrae for years (especially of its weight-management, GLP-1-like &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1"&gt;MB-1 metabolic supplement&lt;/a&gt;), so itâ€™s not a shock that I have the Tone Gummies on an automatically recurring subscription plan now. Each serving contains five milligrams of creatine monohydrate (based on my research, the gold standard creatine type and dose) and has a berry-like flavor. It almost tastes like a berry-flavored powdered sugar gummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Ftry-tone-gummies"&gt;Arraeâ€™s Tone Gummies&lt;/a&gt; are formulated specifically for women to promote lean muscle mass, enhance post-workout recovery, and aid digestion. Along with five milligrams of creatine monohydrate, these gummies also contain gut-nourishing ginger and a postbiotic to combat bloating, foster regularity, and prevent any unwanted â€œbulking.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt; I used to dread my daily creatine dose, and now I actually look forward to it. Plus, as someone who travels at least once a month, the fact that Iâ€™m not transporting suspicious white powder in a random vessel or plastic bag through the TSA is a major selling point for these gummies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If youâ€™re looking for a clean protein supplement that doesnâ€™t require consuming excess sugar, meat, and calories, Arraeâ€™s new &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fclear-protein" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fclear-protein"&gt;Clear Protein+&lt;/a&gt; is worth adding to cart as well. Each packet is formulated with 15 grams of grass-fed whey and collagen protein, as well as electrolytes, and for just 70 calories per serving. Think your standard electrolyte packet, but without the excess sugar, chemicals, and saccharine taste. Add these two muscle-supporting supplements to my ride-or-die &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=1701660&amp;amp;m=120420&amp;amp;urllink=www.arrae.com%2Fpages%2Fmb-1"&gt;â€œfaux-zempicâ€� MB1&lt;/a&gt; and youâ€™ve got the ultimate body-composition-boosting trio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="b-article-body__h2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORE FROM SCOUTED:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 17:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5SUkViREh5R2ZpcDR2dU56V1RjQTVDVUxHLXlOTm9lNklVQmU3Q1NDNHNQRjZWMl9oUzhlWXN4UEtnMmNKSGFXWFBVQVNTSTVZSzJ3U0lpTXVyR2lKTmFIa3hkR2JfUEdneGJ5LXprdmQtRTA</guid></item><item><title>如果您想在60天内看起来和感觉更年轻，请告别这7个习惯- VegOut | If you want to look and feel younger in 60 days, say goodbye to these 7 habits - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxPZER2SFpzY0VRRDVqNXd1d2hBOFl0TVlRSmFmQ2o1NUpINXZzMGlrMkJoT2tUaVFpdlRpN0lsN1ktWGl5RmFOc2Vwd3UxdlY3eTY5Z2tTYWQ3M09PRXFrN0wtM3dVRFhzbXBzN1dTZi16T3JUb052LVFxTDZFY2JwNjItUVA3djZtQm80V1VVOUVScVNYb2NoeE55ci1WUUhyOThLNzdXM1FXdFpxMjIxUV80LUU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1135"&gt;Sixty days ago, I hit what I call a “high-definition moment.” I’d just climbed three flights of office stairs, latte in hand, and caught my reflection: puffy eyes, sallow skin, shoulders slumped like a crooked coat hanger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1135"&gt;My spreadsheet brain kicked in—if the numbers don’t add up, change the inputs. That afternoon I drafted a personal experiment: for two months I would prune the daily habits scientists link to accelerated aging and replace them with low-friction alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="429" data-end="1135"&gt;The payoff was remarkable: deeper sleep, steadier mood, a brighter complexion, and enough energy to skip the 3 p.m. coffee. Here’s the seven-item checklist that made the difference—and how each swap works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1142" data-end="1167"&gt;1. Skimping on sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1169" data-end="1601"&gt;We treat sleep like an optional software update, clicking “remind me tomorrow” until the system crashes. Trouble is, the hard drive (your DNA) keeps score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1169" data-end="1601"&gt;A 2024 &lt;em data-start="1332" data-end="1340"&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study showed that chronic insomnia speeds up the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-84957-1?.com"&gt;GrimAge epigenetic clock&lt;/a&gt;, a blood-based marker that predicts mortality risk; put simply, six-hour nights can make your cells behave years older than the calendar says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1603" data-end="2176"&gt;To nudge my bedtime earlier, I scheduled “lights-out meetings” in my calendar at 10 p.m.—no agenda, just a recurring commitment. The ritual felt silly for a week, but the visual block stiff-armed late-night emails and streaming rabbit holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1603" data-end="2176"&gt;Within three weeks my resting heart rate dropped, and the gray half-moons under my eyes looked like they’d been erased with concealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1603" data-end="2176"&gt;For anyone skeptical, do the math: banking 56–60 hours of shut-eye per week equals eight full nights of cellular repair every 30 days. That’s compound interest you can literally see in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2183" data-end="2218"&gt;2. Living the chair-bound life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2220" data-end="2629"&gt;Most of us sit longer than our phones charge. A systematic review of 48 studies found that regular exercise preserves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8879766/?.com"&gt;telomere length&lt;/a&gt;—the protective caps on DNA that fray with age—while inactivity lets them shrink faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2220" data-end="2629"&gt;Telomeres are like the plastic tips on shoelaces; once they wear down, the lace unravels. Daily movement, even short bouts, slows that fraying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2631" data-end="3170"&gt;In practice, I turned every conference call into a roaming meeting. Headset on, I paced a looping circuit from desk to kitchen, adding roughly 4,000 steps without reshuffling my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2631" data-end="3170"&gt;Bonus: walking activated my “idea engine”—the best line items in my quarterly budget presentation were drafted mid-stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2631" data-end="3170"&gt;If treadmills bore you, pair routines: brew morning coffee while doing calf raises, stream your favorite show only if you stretch through the first act, or meet a friend for a brisk “walk-and-talk” instead of sitting over fries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3177" data-end="3212"&gt;3. Sipping sugar by the bottle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3214" data-end="3684"&gt;Yes, that “innocent” craft cola counts. Harvard researchers tracking 15,000 adults with type 2 diabetes found that each additional sugar-sweetened beverage raised the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/04/sugary-drinks-raise-risk-of-premature-death-in-people-with-type-2-diabetes/?.com"&gt;risk of cardiovascular death by 8 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3214" data-end="3684"&gt;Internally, fructose also binds to skin collagen, forming advanced glycation end-products (appropriately nicknamed “AGEs”) that stiffen tissue and deepen wrinkles. Think of it as shrink-wrapping your face in plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3686" data-end="4212"&gt;During the 60-day trial, I swapped my 3 p.m. soda for sparkling water spiked with frozen raspberries. The first week felt like quitting a sitcom mid-season—flat, anticlimactic—but by week two my palate recalibrated and afternoon brain fog vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3686" data-end="4212"&gt;Track your own liquid intake for seven days; you might be shocked to find 200–400 stealth calories sliding through a straw. Replace half with flavored seltzer or unsweetened tea and watch your energy curve flatten in a good way—no more syrupy spikes followed by sleepy troughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4219" data-end="4262"&gt;4. Chasing that “always-on” adrenaline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4264" data-end="4522"&gt;When inbox pings trigger a cortisol surge, your body thinks it’s sprinting from a lion even while seated. Chronic stress shortens telomeres, spikes systemic inflammation, and sabotages collagen repair—effectively paying triple interest on a lifestyle loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4524" data-end="5142"&gt;My antidote borrowed from the trading floor: the 5-5-5 pause. Before replying to any tense email, I took five slow breaths, held for five seconds, and exhaled for five. The micro-ritual lasted under a minute but recalibrated my nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4524" data-end="5142"&gt;By week four the smartwatch data told its own story: fewer jaw-clench headaches, steadier heart-rate variability, and—surprise—more thoughtful email replies that required fewer follow-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4524" data-end="5142"&gt;If breathing apps feel woo-woo, rebrand them in financial terms: each deep inhale is a deposit in your cellular savings account; the momentary pause banks years of health dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5149" data-end="5183"&gt;5. Soaking up unprotected sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5185" data-end="5532"&gt;A little daylight sets your circadian clock, but ultraviolet rays punch holes in collagen faster than you can say “serum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5185" data-end="5532"&gt;Dermatology research estimates up to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3790843/?.com"&gt;80 percent of visible facial aging&lt;/a&gt; stems from cumulative UV exposure. Translation: sunscreen is still the cheapest anti-aging product on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5534" data-end="6108"&gt;To ingrain the habit, I parked the sunscreen pump beside my toothbrush. Brushing equals SPF—no willpower required. Gel formulas with a barely-there finish replaced the heavy, beach-day lotions I loathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5534" data-end="6108"&gt;Two months later, my freckles stopped multiplying and friends asked if I’d “done something” to my skin. The answer was less glamorous than a laser treatment: I’d simply put a cap on daily sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5534" data-end="6108"&gt;For outdoor enthusiasts the rule of thumb is SPF 30 every two hours, wide-brim hat, and sunglasses that block UVA and UVB. Think of those shades as collagen’s bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6115" data-end="6147"&gt;6. Feeding the inner critic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6149" data-end="6522"&gt;Negative self-talk elevates cortisol and dampens dopamine, the double punch that drains motivation and accelerates biological wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6149" data-end="6522"&gt;Self-compassion researcher Kristin Neff points out that replacing harsh judgment with supportive inner dialogue flips the nervous system from threat to care and&lt;a href="https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/SC-Germer-Chapter.pdf?.com"&gt; generates a cascade of calming oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6524" data-end="7140"&gt;During the experiment I noticed how often my mental narrator sneered, “You’re behind,” or “You look exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6524" data-end="7140"&gt;Instead of shutting it down, I responded aloud, “We’re learning.” Sounds corny, but the verbal reframing turned sneers into neutral status reports—“Current position: improving; next step: tweak the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6524" data-end="7140"&gt;Over 60 days my posture subtly straightened, and I found myself volunteering for camera-on calls rather than hiding behind profile photos. Replace your critic with a coach: state the observation, then propose one constructive action. You’ll feel the emotional temperature drop almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7147" data-end="7184"&gt;7. Doom-scrolling into isolation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7186" data-end="7492"&gt;Scrolling a highlight reel while sitting alone convinces your brain everyone else is sprinting ahead, eroding self-worth and inviting &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf?.com"&gt;low-grade loneliness&lt;/a&gt;—a health risk comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to the U.S. Surgeon General’s 2023 advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7494" data-end="8166"&gt;My workaround was embarrassingly simple: after 8 p.m. my phone flips to grayscale. The washed-out palette turns vibrant feeds into dull spreadsheets—the temptation drops by half. The reclaimed minutes went toward ten-minute calls with friends, which spiked oxytocin and finished the day on an upward social note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7494" data-end="8166"&gt;You don’t need to delete social media; you need to corral it. Cap your social apps at 45 minutes daily, and pair each scroll session with a commitment to one real-time interaction—coffee chat, voice message, quick walk with your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7494" data-end="8166"&gt;The goal isn’t digital detox; it’s restoring balance so online life amplifies, rather than replaces, genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8173" data-end="8240"&gt;Younger is a daily ledger, not a distant lottery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8242" data-end="8711"&gt;Feeling youthful isn’t cosmetic; it’s compound interest on tiny choices. Over 60 days, trimming these seven habits recalibrated my energy, skin tone, and mood more reliably than any pricey potion or high-tech gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8242" data-end="8711"&gt;Pick one habit and run a two-week A/B test—compare your sleep score, afternoon alertness, or mirror check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8242" data-end="8711"&gt;Aging may be inevitable, but accelerated aging is often optional, and the levers sit in your calendar, pantry, inbox, and thought loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8713" data-end="8856"&gt;Your own 60-day clock starts whenever you decide to hit “optimize.” Here’s to budgeting for a younger tomorrow—one smarter line item at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting onions ranks among the most dreaded kitchen tasks for many &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/home/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with home"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; cooks. The inevitable tears and burning sensation can turn a simple &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/cooking/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with cooking"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; preparation into an uncomfortable experience. However, recent scientific research has uncovered a surprisingly straightforward method to chop onions without the waterworks. This technique could revolutionize how we approach this essential culinary ingredient that features in countless dishes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific insights into why onions make us cry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding why onions trigger tears helps explain the scientific solution. When you cut into an onion, you damage its cells, releasing enzymes that convert sulfur compounds into syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This volatile chemical rises through the air and irritates the sensitive membranes in your eyes, prompting them to produce tears as a protective response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-in-text-1" id="farmi-1297554083"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="3843226833" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This chemical reaction occurs naturally as a defense mechanism for the onion plant. Research conducted at Cornell University has delved deeper into this process, examining exactly how these irritating compounds become airborne during cutting. Their findings reveal that the method of cutting significantly impacts how much of this tear-inducing substance reaches your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional remedies like chilling onions or cutting them underwater offer limited effectiveness against this chemical reaction. However, the Cornell research team discovered that the primary factors affecting tear production relate to knife technique rather than external interventions. This revelation provides a practical solution that doesn’t require special equipment or preparation steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense-3" id="farmi-2526234600"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="9294255259" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense" id="farmi-1037479000"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/14/french-pastry-chefs-know-it-this-type-of-butter-makes-the-best-pie-crusts/"&gt;French pastry chefs know which butter creates superior pie crusts&lt;/a&gt;, professional chefs have long understood that proper knife skills make a difference when cutting onions – now &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/science/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with science"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; confirms why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The simple technique for tear-free onion cutting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking research from Cornell University reveals that two key factors determine how much eye-irritating spray gets released when cutting onions: knife sharpness and cutting speed. Contrary to what many might assume, the solution doesn’t involve fancy gadgets or unusual preparation methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists created a specialized guillotine apparatus that allowed them to test different blade types and cutting speeds while filming the resulting spray patterns. Their experiments conclusively demonstrated that using a sharp knife and cutting slowly dramatically reduces the amount of irritating compounds released into the air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using dull knives, the researchers observed that the blade pushed down on the onion layers, causing them to bend inward before springing back and forcefully ejecting juice into the air. Sharp knives, by contrast, cleanly slice through the onion cells without compressing them, minimizing juice spray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cutting speed proved equally important. Fast chopping motions, while seemingly efficient, actually generated more airborne mist. The researchers found that slowing down your cutting motion allows for more precise slicing and significantly less tear-inducing spray. This patient approach yields better results than rushing through the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This technique also carries additional benefits beyond preventing tears. The same approach that prevents &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/16/italians-add-this-ingredient-to-their-cakes-making-them-incredibly-moist-and-soft/"&gt;moisture loss when adding secret ingredients to cakes&lt;/a&gt; helps preserve the onion’s flavor compounds when cut properly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical applications beyond kitchen comfort&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend beyond simply making onion preparation more comfortable. The scientists noted that minimizing airborne food particles has broader hygiene benefits in the kitchen. Reducing the spray from cutting vegetables with tough outer layers helps limit the spread of potential pathogens during food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This finding proves particularly relevant for professional kitchens where large quantities of onions are processed daily. The cumulative effect of reducing airborne particles creates a healthier environment for food preparation. Commercial kitchens can benefit from implementing these techniques as standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For home cooks, adopting this method eliminates the need for quirky workarounds that many have tried over the years. No more swimming goggles, bread in the mouth, or freezing onions before cutting. The solution lies simply in using proper equipment and technique – a sharp knife and a patient cutting motion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maintaining sharp kitchen knives represents a wise investment for any &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/cook/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with cook"&gt;cook&lt;/a&gt;. While many focus on &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/21/this-is-the-household-appliance-that-consumes-the-most-electricity-after-heating/"&gt;reducing energy consumption of major kitchen appliances&lt;/a&gt;, proper knife maintenance requires minimal resources while delivering significant benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery reminds us that sometimes the most effective solutions come from understanding the science behind everyday problems. Just as &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/03/14/more-and-more-gardeners-are-burying-bananas-in-their-gardens-and-once-you-know-why-it-makes-perfect-sense/"&gt;gardeners apply scientific principles when using natural fertilizers&lt;/a&gt;, home cooks can apply these findings to improve their culinary experience through better understanding of the chemistry happening in their kitchens&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that psilocybin produces widespread changes in brain network organization, disrupting normal patterns of communication between brain regions and creating a unique state of high-frequency neural connectivity. These effects varied depending on dose and time, revealing two distinct phases of brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is the active compound found in certain mushrooms and has gained attention for its potential to treat conditions such as depression, anxiety, and addiction. When consumed, psilocybin is converted into psilocin, a substance that binds to serotonin receptors in the brain and produces profound changes in perception, emotion, and sense of self. In humans, psilocybin is known to temporarily alter how different parts of the brain interact, but less is known about how these effects emerge over time or whether animal models can capture the complexity of the psychedelic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We use neurochemical and neurophysiological approaches, including brain network changes, to understand the mechanistic basis of different states of consciousness and our ongoing work with psychedelics is another step in that direction,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://pal.lab.medicine.umich.edu/lab-members" target="_blank"&gt;Dinesh Pal&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the primary challenges of studying psychedelics in animal models is the lack of a verbal report, but that also makes it fascinating, because any evidence (e.g., EEG based metrics) for a ‘psychedelic’ state in animal models, akin to what occurs in humans, would bring us closer to the idea that consciousness is a universal phenomenon; it just manifests in different ways in different species.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, the researchers used high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor brain activity across 27 sites in the rat cortex. EEG is a noninvasive technique that measures electrical activity in the brain using sensors placed on the scalp. It records the brain’s natural oscillations, or “brain waves,” which reflect patterns of neural communication across different regions. The goal was to map how psilocybin changes the organization of brain networks and to identify specific patterns of activity that might reflect altered states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 12 adult Sprague Dawley rats—six male and six female—that were surgically implanted with EEG electrodes. Each rat received intravenous infusions of psilocybin at three different doses (0.1, 1, and 10 milligrams per kilogram), as well as a saline control, on separate days. The researchers recorded EEG data before, during, and after each 60-minute infusion and also monitored behavior through video recordings and movement sensors. By using a continuous infusion method rather than a single injection, the researchers were able to observe gradual changes in brain activity as the drug took effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on three specific frequency bands in the EEG data: theta (4–10 Hz), medium gamma (70–110 Hz), and high gamma (110–150 Hz). These frequencies are thought to play a role in coordinating communication between brain regions. Psilocybin altered both the strength and organization of activity in these bands, but not in a simple or linear way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At moderate doses (1 mg/kg), psilocybin increased activity in the posterior theta network and strengthened communication between frontal and parietal brain areas in the gamma bands. This state was marked by widespread increases in high gamma activity in the frontal cortex and greater connectivity across distant brain regions. The researchers also found that psilocybin disrupted the normal relationship between theta and gamma activity, a phenomenon known as phase-amplitude coupling. This decoupling was most evident in frontal areas and occurred in a dose-dependent fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At higher doses (10 mg/kg), a different pattern emerged. Early in the infusion, the brain showed a similar increase in gamma connectivity, but as the dose accumulated, theta connectivity in posterior regions decreased, and the gamma network in the frontal cortex became more dominant. These changes unfolded over time, revealing a shift from one state of brain organization to another as psilocybin levels rose. Notably, these effects occurred even as the rats became less physically active, suggesting the brain changes were not simply a result of movement or arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavioral data supported this nonlinear pattern. Moderate doses of psilocybin increased the number of head-twitch responses—a common indicator of psychedelic activity in rodents—and briefly heightened movement. But at the highest dose, movement decreased significantly after about 30 minutes, even though gamma connectivity continued to increase. This suggests that the changes in brain dynamics were not just reflections of behavior but may correspond to a unique internal state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a bit surprising to note that the changes in EEG gamma connectivity – shown to be closely linked to states of consciousness – occurred in the absence of any behavioral activity or after the psilocybin-induced locomotion and/or head twitches ceased,” Pal told PsyPost. “This dissociation suggests the need for a careful assessment of head twitch response as a surrogate for psychedelic or non-ordinary states induced by psychedelic drugs in rodents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify brain network organization, the researchers used measures such as node degree (the number of connections a brain region has) and the strength of synchronization between regions. These metrics showed that psilocybin reorganized networks in both frequency-specific and region-specific ways. The theta network, typically involved in memory and attention, became stronger in posterior regions at moderate doses but weakened at higher doses. In contrast, the high gamma network, which is thought to reflect localized activity and potentially neuroplasticity, became stronger in frontal areas as the dose increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings was the decoupling of gamma activity from the theta phase. Under normal conditions, gamma bursts tend to occur at specific points in the theta rhythm, a coupling that is thought to help organize information flow in the brain. Psilocybin disrupted this timing relationship, particularly at higher doses, suggesting a breakdown in the usual coordination between local and long-range neural signals. This kind of decoupling has been observed in other psychedelic states and is believed to reflect a loosening of the brain’s typical constraints, allowing for more flexible or unusual patterns of thought and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study does not prove that rats experience anything like a human psychedelic trip, the results suggest that the psilocybin state is marked by identifiable changes in brain network architecture that can be studied in animal models. These findings align with reports from human studies showing increased connectivity between distant brain regions and decreased segregation of functional networks during psychedelic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings related to brain network changes in this study, along with the data from other laboratories showing cellular and molecular level neural changes, show that rodents could indeed be a good model system to study non-ordinary states of consciousness such as a psychedelic state,” Pal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are important limitations to consider. Because rodents cannot report their subjective experiences, the researchers could not directly link changes in brain activity to changes in perception or emotion. Also, although the results support a role for serotonin receptor signaling, the study did not manipulate specific receptors to determine their causal role. Additionally, the EEG method used in this study does not measure deep brain structures like the thalamus or claustrum, which are also thought to be involved in the psychedelic state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings have important implications for future research. The ability to map dynamic changes in brain networks during a psychedelic experience opens new avenues for understanding how these drugs affect consciousness and cognition. The study also provides a foundation for testing how different psychedelics might produce similar or distinct patterns of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of our main focus areas is to understand if there is any unique neurophysiological or neurochemical signature that can be associated with a ‘psychedelic’ state in animal models,” Pal explained. “To that end, we have completed studies using diverse psychedelics, including subanesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, N’N-dimethyltryptamine, and psilocybin in the recent paper. We intend to mine these datasets for shared EEG signatures across psychedelics. In addition, we are conducting animal studies to determine the therapeutic potential of psychedelics in alleviating chronic pain (PMID: 38113836).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03308-4" target="_blank"&gt;Intravenous psilocybin induces dose-dependent changes in functional network organization in rat cortex&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Brian H.

Focusing on brain fitness now may help you slow the change and ensure your brain stays sharp through the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to start nourishing your brain for healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1) Solve puzzles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll start with the easiest strategy to integrate into your daily life: puzzles. Solving puzzles can benefit the brain in several ways, from &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/have-you-done-your-crossword-puzzle-today-202211292857" target="_self"&gt;improving memory&lt;/a&gt; to boosting problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They may slow the rate of cognitive decline and how quickly the brain decreases in size as we age," Marshall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal Neurology reported that playing games like checkers or completing jigsaw puzzles can delay the onset of &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012388" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's by about five years&lt;/a&gt;. Different research supports the idea that solving crossword puzzles or journaling &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807256" target="_self"&gt;can lower the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts suggest that puzzles help curb cognitive decline because they expand the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-is-cognitive-reserve" target="_self"&gt;brain's cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;, or the ability to solve and cope with problems. Activities to try include putting together &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6174231/" target="_self"&gt;jigsaw puzzles&lt;/a&gt; or solving other types of puzzles, such as Sudoku, crosswords, memory games and math problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2) Learn a new skill&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like stimulating the brain by playing games or solving puzzles, learning a new skill has short-term and long-term advantages. By learning a new skill, you're strategically activating several parts of your brain simultaneously. You're also promoting &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/" target="_self"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; by creating new pathways and strengthening those connections as you continue honing the skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be learning a new language, painting or trying out a new sport. Just make sure it's challenging or complex, and continue to practice for the best brain results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3) Prioritize sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/4-ways-your-body-is-telling-you-to-prioritize-sleep/" target="_self"&gt;Sleep is one of the most important things&lt;/a&gt; you can do for your body. While I'm not saying there's a right or wrong way to sleep, research suggests that how much sleep you get and the quality of your sleep &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-middle-age-may-increase-dementia-risk" target="_self"&gt;influence your risk for dementia&lt;/a&gt;. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, a single night of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/sleep-debt-the-price-we-pay-for-poor-rest/" target="_self"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/12/2168" target="_self"&gt;age your brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/if-you-arent-sleeping-your-brain-might-be-aging-prematurely/" target="_self"&gt;goes on in the brain&lt;/a&gt; while we sleep, including clearing out toxins and creating new neural pathways. If you don't get enough sleep, your brain doesn't have time to carry out these functions and cognition suffers. Establishing a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/the-ultimate-bedtime-routine-for-sleeping-better/" target="_self"&gt;bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt; can have a big impact on your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/6-habits-for-better-sleep/" target="_self"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/reading-to-fall-asleep-changed-my-life-heres-why-you-should-try-it/" target="_self"&gt;reading a book&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/yoga-can-save-your-sleep-9-poses-to-try-tonight/" target="_self"&gt;practicing yoga&lt;/a&gt; before bed, integrating relaxation into your night can help &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/6-habits-for-better-sleep/" target="_self"&gt;boost your sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4) Focus on your nutrition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you eat also will influence the rate of cognitive decline you experience as you age. Studies have found that people who follow the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37050953/#:~:text=Several%20micronutrients%20like%20B%20group,of%20cognitive%20decline%20and%20dementia." target="_self"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25681666/" target="_self"&gt;MIND&lt;/a&gt; (Mediterranean Dash Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diets tend to have fewer cognitive impairments and dementias compared to those following other diets. More research is needed to conclude why this is true. However, it might have something to do with the way those diets prioritize foods that protect the brain with &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" target="_self"&gt;anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/master-the-mediterranean-diet-with-the-help-of-these-tips-and-recipes/" target="_self"&gt;Master the Mediterranean Diet With the Help of These Tips and Recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter if you choose to follow a strict diet or just improve your current meal rotation, you'll want to focus on improving your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/blood-sugar-heres-how-to-measure-it-and-tell-if-your-level-is-healthy/" target="_self"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and dropping high levels of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/ldl_hdl.htm" target="_self"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; to reduce your risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods to incorporate into your diet for &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/foods-linked-to-better-brainpower" target="_self"&gt;better brain health&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens like spinach, kale and lettuce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salmon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/study-green-tea-and-other-molecules-uncovers-new-therapeutic-strategy-alzheimers" target="_self"&gt;Green tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetables like broccoli and carrots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5) Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that following an active lifestyle is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10046723/#:~:text=A%20physically%20active%20lifestyle%20is,24%2C25%2C26%5D." target="_self"&gt;lower cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; over time. Your heart rate increases when you exercise, which increases blood flow to the brain. This can help spark new development of nerve cells, a process called &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-book-of-neurogenesis" target="_self"&gt;neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt;. Exercise also &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6296269/" target="_self"&gt;promotes&lt;/a&gt; increased connections between cells, making the brain more adaptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, any &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/3-exercises-to-prioritize-as-you-age/" target="_self"&gt;exercise that's good for the body&lt;/a&gt; will also help the mind. It doesn't have to be lifting weights; walking, swimming and dancing also achieve the same results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/how-exercise-helps-boost-your-memory-brain-health-as-you-age/" target="_self"&gt;How Exercise Helps Boost Your Memory-Brain Health as You Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Halfpoint Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6) Make connections with others&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall pointed out that prioritizing high-quality relationships with others can benefit the brain. According to a meta-analysis of &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-12567-5" target="_self"&gt;longitudinal cohort studies&lt;/a&gt;, limited or poor relationships were associated with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing social contact is an essential part of aging well. Whether spending time with your family or putting yourself out there at your local community center, staying connected is an integral part of aging gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Too long; didn't read?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brains change as we age; there is no way around it. However, integrating any of these easy habits into your routine can help nourish and safeguard your brain for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also a few things you should avoid to keep your brain in top shape. Heavy cigarette smoking has been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27492358/" target="_self"&gt;associated with cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in middle age. Marshall added that &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/8-strategies-to-stop-drinking/" target="_self"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt;, poor diet and unmanaged high &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/best-blood-pressure-monitor/" target="_self"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; can also negatively impact the brain as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't worry; there's still time to turn it around. Even if you smoke now, quitting has the potential to return your risk of cognitive decline to a level that's comparable to those who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOTjNGbHZ6aWFHZjl1TnlYWTFleGhSWThpaE5KMGNOSmR3eTBxei10TFpDbkExdFc5dTRzRmxBeG9UT2k4cUFKNDNsS2lSQk9XUngzZlZ3QV82bkJGakx3RzFhODlfN3ctaE13N1hSYkVhbjRIbDI4R1hhUjlMRWRBMmhOVVUzbTB4al9sOGpmaVYwX2hPUjZ5SXZzWERoenhzeFdmanRRb0Y0NW8</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，身体外的体验可能是应对机制，而不是病理学-汇报 | Out-of-Body Experiences Could Be Coping Mechanisms Instead of Pathology, New Research Suggests - The Debrief</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPSlJkaThVSUJIeExNdjlvMHV0dXJPbzVKUDlseGl5eTE3TW4yNENBMVdnM0R1TkpwRzFOYk9Ra3ZFRFVjaldYbWhIVG55M09JR3VBdm9haXNWOVpnWXZ0U0tlUTFYdjN6U3MxYmpqLVVheFRGa2lwVG9SQXlJSEVDcmdmVmVVSTVnTk5tbkNXXzRTT2I4WERvUUFxenlCdVlvYUxmMlQtMVk4QjFzbDh2dHh6WFgwVnNG?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;
																										&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/out-of-body-experiences-can-lead-to-profound-and-lasting-psychological-transformations-new-research-reports/"&gt;Out-of-body experiences&lt;/a&gt; (OBEs), where experiencers feel like their mind and/or spirit is detached from their body, may be symptoms of &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/scientists-may-have-just-gotten-closer-to-being-able-to-alter-memories-new-research-says/"&gt;traumatic experiences&lt;/a&gt; or high stress situations, new research has shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings point to traumatic events, which often occur during childhood, as a likely cause of OBEs as opposed to poor mental wellness, as past research has suggested. The scientists behind the discovery suggest that viewing OBEs as symptoms rather than causes could improve treatment options for experiencers who have been diagnosed with a &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/playing-video-games-can-boost-satisfaction-and-improve-mental-wellness-new-research-shows/"&gt;mental health condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If OBEs are understood not as symptoms of pathology but as coping mechanisms – especially in response to trauma – this reframing can lead to several important shifts in clinical practice, research and public understanding,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1087170" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Marina Weiler, PhD from the University of Virginia’s (UVA) School of Medicine and the lead author of a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2025.113292"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; detailing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Connection Between Out-of-Body Experiences and Mental Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous efforts to study out-of-body experiences found a statistical correlation to&lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/social-media-is-impacting-young-peoples-mental-health-new-research-shows/"&gt; poor mental health&lt;/a&gt;. The authors of the new study say these findings, and the general attitudes of medical professionals tasked with understanding and treating experiencers suffering from both OBEs and &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/being-read-on-reddit-how-an-ai-model-can-predict-a-users-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, have resulted in experiencers avoiding seeking out treatment due to stigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many people believe that having OBEs means there’s something wrong with them, so they often keep it to themselves out of fear of being judged or seen as mentally ill,” Weiler, who is also a neuroscientist with UVA’s Division of Perceptual Studies, explained. “Unfortunately, many mental health professionals still view these experiences in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the researchers said that an examination of prior research into the potential causes and effects of OBEs revealed a much more nuanced picture where many people don’t consider the experiences themselves as negative. For example, many experiencers say they are more open to new ideas about the nature of existence, experience greater inner peace, and often report they are less afraid of dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Weiler and colleagues, one previous study found that 55% of experiencers felt the experience permanently changed their lives. 71% of the same study participants said they experienced lasting benefits of their OBE. And nearly half (40%) said the out-of-body experience was the single “greatest thing” that had ever happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to determine why something many consider beneficial was still treated as a cause of poor mental health and not a symptom of something else, the researchers collected online questionnaire data from OBE experiencers. Along with establishing whether the person was confident that they had undergone an authentic out-of-body experience, this questionnaire asked about the experiencer’s medical and mental health history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey Results Show OBEs May Be a Symptom and Not a Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the online survey responses, the team found several interesting trends. Four out of five respondents reported between one and four out-of-body experiences, while the remaining one out of five reported five or more OBEs. 74% of the experiencers described the event as “spontaneous,” 9% reported the use of &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/study-says-spiritual-psychedelics-may-aid-mental-health/"&gt;psychoactive compounds&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with the experience, and 8.2% described the OBEs as self-induced through &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/study-finds-mindfulness-training-may-induce-altered-states-of-consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/study-finds-mindfulness-training-may-induce-altered-states-of-consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;visualization&lt;/a&gt;, or other &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/a-new-study-reveals-surprising-results-on-the-mind-altering-power-of-binaural-beats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;non-pharmacological techniques&lt;/a&gt;. Only 0.7% reported &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/hypnosis-radically-alters-how-the-brain-processes-information-new-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hypnosis&lt;/a&gt; as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, Weiler said experiencers “tend to report poorer mental health” compared to non-experiencers, supporting the findings of previous studies. The results also showed that the younger the experiencer was during their first OBE, the more likely the experiencer was also diagnosed with a concurrent mental health condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the team found that the average first-reported OBE occurred at a young age, often during childhood, and experiencers also reported significantly higher levels of childhood trauma than non-experiencers. These correlations led the team to propose that OBEs may not be a cause, but rather a “dissociative response to overwhelming stress or emotional pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings also suggest that OBEs may function as a coping mechanism in response to past trauma, rather than serving as a cause of mental illness,” Weiler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said this view of OBEs “shifts the focus from causation” to the possibility that OBEs “may also emerge as a consequence, a coping strategy for navigating difficult or traumatic experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building ‘Community and Resilience’ Among OBE Experiencers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study’s conclusion, the authors reaffirm the idea that out-of-body experiences may be a reaction to events and that the correlation to poor mental health may, in some part, be attached to the unwillingness of experiencers to seek treatment. As a result, Weiller says she and her colleagues “encourage mental health practitioners to reconsider the way they interpret these experiences and to approach them with greater openness and sensitivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also suggested further research exploring the mental health care that OBE experiencers receive could further the goal of better treatment and reduced stigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we hope to reduce the stigma around this topic, encourage help-seeking, and build community and resilience among experiencers,” Weiler said.&lt;/p&gt;

She was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2050, the number of people with chronic low back pain is expected to grow to 843 million, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet prevention of low back pain is often overlooked in research and clinical practice, Pocovi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from this latest study show there is the possibility of using physical activity as prevention. Pocovi said the research also "suggests that we don't need to complicate our exercise routines to protect ourselves against chronic low back pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More steps, less pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the connection between walking and back pain prevention, the research team analyzed data from more than 11,000 participants age 20 and older from the Trøndelag Health, or HUNT, Study in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2017 and 2019, HUNT researchers asked study participants to wear accelerometers for seven days to track their walking patterns. The HUNT team then followed up from 2021 and 2023 and asked if participants experienced back pain, according to the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People were divided into four groups: those who walked less than 78 minutes in a day, 78 to 100 minutes, 101 to 124 minutes, and more than 125 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that as the amount of daily walking increased, the risk of chronic low back pain decreased, and preliminary evidence revealed moderate or brisk walking was more protective than a slow pace, Pocovi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to have confidence in the study results, including the large sample size and the use of accelerometers instead of people reporting their own levels of physical activity, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the walking data was only captured over one week, which might not be reflective of people's patterns over a month or year, Pocovi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is also observational, which means that while it can show associations, researchers can't say for sure that the walking caused reduced risk of low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting more walking in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is low back pain a leading cause of disability –– it's also expensive. On average, people spend more than $30,000 on back pain-related costs over the five years after first diagnosis, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1529943023035428" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an April 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy, inexpensive changes that prevent chronic low back pain can make a big difference, Haddadj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study wasn't able to address if walking 100 minutes straight had more, less or the same impact as accumulating that same amount of time in short bursts, Pocovi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in most cases, unless there is an underlying medical condition, any amount of walking is better than none, Pocovi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start with short walking sessions, either by planning specific walks or finding small ways to integrate a brief stroll into your daily routine," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She likes to take stairs instead of the elevator or walk to a coffee shop a little farther from her home, Pocovi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key is to gradually increase your walking in a sustainable and enjoyable way," she said in an email. "Additionally, it can be helpful to have a friend, partner, or colleague join you for walks to keep yourself motivated and accountable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

We’ve all accepted this as fact. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/dopamine-detox" target="_blank"&gt;Digital hyperconnectivity&lt;/a&gt;, working as if it were the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-toxic-productivity" target="_blank"&gt;sole purpose&lt;/a&gt; of our lives, and an endless barrage of spiraling thoughts make stress not only inevitable, but constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are also many ways to mitigate the endless stress. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/demystifying-transcendental-meditation" target="_blank"&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/why-everyone-should-try-forest-bathing" target="_blank"&gt;walking in nature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/breathwork-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;breathwork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/shake-it-out-the-easy-expert-approved-way-to-unwind-after-a-stressful-day" target="_blank"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-find-a-virtual-therapist" target="_blank"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gratitude-journal" target="_blank"&gt;journaling&lt;/a&gt; are all proven to help promote calm and ease anxiety. However, it’s also important to remember that there are other quick and easy tools that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the message from longevity and Blue Zone expert &lt;a data-offer-url="https://danbuettner.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://danbuettner.com/"}' href="https://danbuettner.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dan Buettner&lt;/a&gt; during a recent visit to the podcast &lt;em&gt;High Net Purpose&lt;/em&gt;. The expert confirmed that although there are many &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/5-simple-tricks-to-instantly-lower-your-stress-levels" target="_blank"&gt;ways to alleviate stress&lt;/a&gt;, they can often be abandoned when we’re busy. Luckily, simple habits can be equally effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A tiny de-stressing habit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buettner says that one of the best ways to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/lower-cortisol" target="_blank"&gt;reduce stress&lt;/a&gt;—and therefore, cortisol—is just to talk to other people. This can be anyone: a friend, neighbor, colleague, your mom, or the barista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says interactions with other people can be real stress relievers. “Having conversations with other human beings is wonderful,” he explains. working as if it were theChance encounters help a lot. The role of the environment we live in and the people we interact with is very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea ties in with another recommendation that is often made by psychologists focused on work issues: If you are stressed at work, stopping to talk with a colleague can help calm you down. And you don’t even have to have a deep conversation; many times it is enough to make banal chatter. It’s really just about making eye contact and having an interaction that takes us out of the constant thought loops that can cause cortisol to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Social relationships are life insurance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In much of his work, Buettner also says that one of the greatest secrets of the people with long life expectancies in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/blue-zones-habits" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt; are social and family relationships. Having a social support network has a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11403199/" target="_blank"&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; influence—not just on longevity in the long term, but on immediate stress. Just think about how much better you feel after one conversation with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE45Sk9oMzhpbTlPY3JwXzN1VjhkaFJrWEtDVmpCZ0EtM3JOdXA0WlRuai1CUEpJT0JlTUNpcnBHNzVFOFVza0RGcFFmT0s0Z0l0eFJDLWtFbnBUOGlycXJSdjQ2T0lUQWJYSFlyaVpXbFExZw</guid></item><item><title>科学家绘制酒精如何改变身体感觉的地图- PsyPost | Scientists map how alcohol changes bodily sensations - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQNTg3OUlxT2hYUXphY2o1b21BbzhPcklnY295YXlYazNwa3RBUnoxd2g1cUp4RE54OGZpQXNpVmhlTUpXbURaVGN6LXBTUXpsR044LWIxV0hXOUYzLUU3RjBJeGdtR1BFaFNqOWtJUFJVSHBPMWJsQ0gwbjZ2TmxCXzlzaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811251338223" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers insight into how alcohol changes our internal bodily experience — and why that might matter for understanding addiction. People who felt less bodily sensation tended to report greater stimulation and less sedation from alcohol — patterns associated with elevated risk for alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to explore how alcohol affects interoception, the ability to sense internal bodily signals like heartbeats or feelings of warmth. Prior research has shown that alcohol alters heart rate and other physiological functions, and that people’s sensitivity to these changes may play a role in how alcohol feels and whether they continue drinking. However, most research has focused on cognitive effects or retrospective reports, not on the actual lived, bodily experience of intoxication as it unfolds in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have known for a long time that people differ in the way they respond to alcohol effects, and that this differential responsiveness can be a risk marker for future addiction problems,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.adapt-lab.nl/team/mateo-leganes-fonteneau" target="_blank"&gt;Mateo Leganes-Fonteneau&lt;/a&gt;, an FNRS Chargé de Recherche at &lt;a href="https://www.uclep.be/labs/ARL/mateo_leganes_fonteneau" target="_blank"&gt;UCLouvain&lt;/a&gt; and Marie Curie Research Fellow at the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has usually been studied by looking at subjective cognitive responses, using questionnaires, or observing basic physiological processes. However, we now know that our sensitivity to bodily states and the way we perceive our bodies plays a key role in shaping our behavior and motivation — but that part of the addiction puzzle is still understudied. With this research I wanted to show that we can measure the subjective bodily sensations associated with alcohol intoxication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers recruited 37 adult social drinkers with no history of psychiatric disorders or substance use treatment. Participants completed two lab sessions in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. On one occasion, they were given a moderate dose of alcohol (0.4 grams per kilogram of body weight, mixed with tonic water and bitters). On the other, they received a placebo beverage with identical taste and smell cues. The order of sessions was randomized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout each session, participants were repeatedly asked to map where they felt bodily sensations using a digital tool called emBODY. This interactive tool allowed them to indicate, on a digital human figure, where they felt activation (such as tingling or warmth) and deactivation (such as numbness or heaviness). These maps were collected at several time points corresponding to the rising and falling phases of their blood alcohol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants filled out questionnaires assessing how sedated or stimulated they felt and completed a task designed to assess cardiac interoception. This task involved listening to their heartbeat and deciding whether a series of tones matched it in speed. Participants also rated their confidence in their decisions, which allowed researchers to assess both accuracy and metacognitive insight into their own interoceptive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodily maps revealed clear differences between the alcohol and placebo conditions. During the ascending phase of intoxication, when blood alcohol levels were rising, participants in the alcohol condition reported intense activation in the chest and head, as well as in the arms. As intoxication wore off during the descending phase, those sensations became more diffuse, with some deactivation (numbness) appearing in the limbs. These patterns were not observed in the placebo condition, which showed weaker and less widespread bodily sensations overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that the strength of bodily sensations was linked to actual physiological changes. During the ascending phase, increases in heart rate predicted greater reported bodily sensation in the alcohol condition, but not in the placebo group. During the descending phase, breath alcohol levels were similarly associated with stronger bodily sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way people felt their bodies during intoxication also predicted how they reported feeling mentally. Participants who experienced more bodily sensation tended to report greater sedation and less stimulation. This was especially true during the rising phase of intoxication, when alcohol typically produces its most energizing effects. People who reported fewer bodily sensations, on the other hand, reported feeling more stimulated and less sedated — suggesting a disconnect between their body’s response and their subjective awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern is noteworthy because earlier studies have shown that people who experience more stimulation and less sedation from alcohol tend to be at higher risk for problematic drinking. These individuals may find alcohol more rewarding and are more likely to seek out its stimulating effects, even as tolerance develops. The new findings suggest that reduced bodily sensation during intoxication may be another factor contributing to this risk, by making alcohol feel more pleasurable and less impairing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that bodily sensations were related to how well participants could judge their heartbeats. During the descending limb of intoxication, those who reported more bodily sensation showed greater metacognitive sensitivity — meaning they had better insight into how accurate their heartbeat judgments were. This suggests that bodily sensations and interoceptive awareness are not separate systems but may be tightly linked during intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People experience a range of bodily sensations when they are intoxicated, and there is inter-individual variability in the intensity of these sensations,” Leganes-Fonteneau told PsyPost. “Depending on how strong those sensations are, they will feel more or less intoxicated. We use our bodily sensations to build the conscious experience of intoxication. These bodily sensations partly reflect the effects of alcohol on physiological states, such as heart rate or breath alcohol content. Bodily sensations act as a window to the conscious perception of internal changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the placebo condition also produced bodily sensations, especially during the early stages of the session. Participants reported some activation in the chest and head even when they had not consumed alcohol, and these sensations were associated with feelings of sedation. The researchers believe this reflects the power of expectancy and conditioning: repeated experiences of drinking alcohol may train the brain to anticipate bodily changes, even when the beverage contains no alcohol. These effects faded over time as the absence of real alcohol became more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People experience bodily sensations when we give them a placebo, and these sensations are similar to those of alcohol,” Leganes-Fonteneau said. “This is important for understanding placebo effects, as they not only generate subjective mental states but also bodily sensations that have no underlying physiological change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining bodily mapping with physiological and psychological measures, the study provides a comprehensive picture of how alcohol affects the body from the inside out. It also supports the idea that bodily sensation is not just a passive side effect of intoxication but an active part of how people experience — and perhaps become vulnerable to — alcohol’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are limitations to consider. First, it was based on a relatively small sample, which limited the ability to detect more nuanced effects, such as sex differences in bodily sensation. Another limitation is that the bodily mapping data were averaged across participants and time points, which may mask individual differences in how intoxication is felt. For example, some people may feel stimulation in their head while others feel sedation in their chest or limbs. A larger study could explore these differences more precisely and link them to personality traits, drinking history, or risk for addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We link these bodily sensations to subjective feelings of intoxication in a way that appears to map onto risk markers for alcohol misuse: those experiencing less bodily sensations would be at higher risk,” Leganes-Fonteneau said. “However, we still do not have cross-sectional (between groups) or longitudinal evidence that (in)sensitivity to bodily sensations of intoxication can predict alcohol misuse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a study conducted in the laboratory, where participants sit by themselves and don’t have much to do, so they end up being able to reflect more directly on their bodily sensations. It is not clear how these bodily sensations would emerge in a real-world setting, where more exteroceptive and social information can distract them. At the same time, this insensitivity to bodily signals might be even more critical when there’s competing information, explaining why some people end up drinking too much without even realizing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the research marks an important step forward in understanding how bodily sensations contribute to the experience of alcohol intoxication. It suggests that people who are less tuned into their internal states may be more vulnerable to alcohol misuse — not because they lack self-control, but because they do not fully register the body’s warning signals. The researchers are currently working on follow-up studies exploring how bodily sensations relate to craving and hangovers, and how these signals can be tracked in everyday life using smartphone-based assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is more than anything a blueprint for how bodily sensations can be measured in applied addiction research and other mental disorders,” Leganes-Fonteneau explained. “We have produced additional work on the bodily sensations of alcohol craving and hangover and are working on integrating bodily sensations within ecological momentary assessment. This can in the future help us target bodily sensations in therapeutic settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251338223" target="_blank"&gt;Mapping acute alcohol effects on bodily sensations: A cross-dimensional interoceptive approach&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Mateo Leganes-Fonteneau, Olivier Desmedt, Micah G.

    &lt;p&gt;Curtis Jackson was feeling fit and healthy in late 2020 when he decided to update his life insurance policy: He was in better shape than he'd been in a while, but he wanted to make sure his wife and three kids were taken care of if anything happened to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, now 46, underwent an intensive physical, and everything seemed to be going well until he received a strange phone call. The call was focused on a questionnaire he had filled out. Jackson had truthfully marked that he did not drink alcohol. But his liver numbers were those of "a functioning alcoholic," he was told. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It set off alarm bells. Jackson went to his primary care physician for another round of bloodwork. That doctor thought he had a problem with his gallbladder. Jackson went to have his gallbladder removed. During that operation, doctors found he had an unusual condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic, progressive disease affects the liver and inflames the bile ducts, causing liver damage. Patients eventually need a liver transplant. There's also a small but real chance of a deadly diagnosis: a dangerous cancer called cholangiocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early treatment and diagnosis can make a difference, so Jackson started undergoing two MRIs a year at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona to make sure he was cancer-free. He also had a regular test to check the progress of his PSC. In October 2024, Jackson had a nerve-wracking appointment where the technician scoping him seemed "very concerned." He felt healthy, but was worried by the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, Jackson and his wife received the news he had been dreading: The tests had diagnosed him with the deadly cancer. He would need to undergo intensive treatment to try to fight the illness. It felt like a repeat of when he had had the initial PSC diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was feeling fine ... and both times netted a result of something pretty serious," Jackson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cholangiocarcinoma? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer, is considered a silent killer, according to Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, the chairman of the division of hematology and medical oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Bekaii-Saab was Jackson's oncologist. It tends to spread to other organs before symptoms appear, so most patients are diagnosed "too late to cure," Bekaii-Saab said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20% of people with PSC are diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, said Dr. Aqel Bashar, the director of the Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center in Phoenix, Arizona, who also treated Jackson. It's a rare disease, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people in the U.S., Bashar said. Not all cases are associated with PCS. Like many other cancers, it is on the rise, Bekaii-Saab said, with diagnoses of cholangiocarcinoma increasing more than 50% in the past decade. Fewer than 10% of the people diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma live more than five years, Bashar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to treat cholangiocarcinoma is with a liver transplant, Bekaii-Saab said. But it can only be done if the disease is caught early, before the cancer spreads. Many cholangiocarcinoma patients are not eligible for a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Jackson's case was caught early. He underwent three weeks of chemotherapy and radiation to kill as many cancer cells as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically, I lived at Mayo Clinic. I would literally do work out of the parking lot, and then go and do radiation," Jackson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During treatment, he lost about 30 pounds. But despite the odds, he remained optimistic that everything would work out. He even encouraged his wife to start a long-anticipated kitchen renovation. In the middle of the process, the family was told a liver was available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 6, he was wheeled into surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Surgery and recovery &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery took about four hours. Six days later, Jackson was released from the hospital. Testing showed that he was cancer-free. For the next year, he will undergo weekly blood tests and have monthly check-ups. He will need close monitoring for the rest of his life, Bashar said, since his transplant needs to be monitored and doctors need to make sure his cholangiocarcinoma does not return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Jackson is trying to focus on his home and family, he said. His routine is "pretty close to normal," though he still can't lift more than 10 pounds, and climbing stairs can be draining. He gained back much of the weight he lost in treatment, and his energy levels are close to where they were before the cancer diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are definitely getting back to normal, which is really exciting. I wasn't expecting that so fast," Jackson said. "We might call it either lucky, or blessed, or whatever. I am just so thankful that I was able to bounce back so quickly." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jacksons are putting the finishing touches on the kitchen renovation, and planning to travel to North Carolina for vacation this summer. He also wants to plan family trips outside the country once he needs less frequent check-ups. His other priority is turning his story into something that can help others, and advocating for organ transplant and donation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a new passion now," Jackson said. "I'm here because of these things. I would like to help this going forward and make sure people are learning the importance of donation." &lt;/p&gt;

The report estimates over 2.3 million illnesses every year are related to contaminated leafy greens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the food supply chain becomes contaminated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the farm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contamination can occur at different stages before bagged salad greens reach the refrigerated produce section and eventually your plate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the field, produce can become contaminated with pathogens from sources such as contaminated irrigation water, wild or domesticated animals, soil, or air,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/kabaker" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kimberly Baker," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/kabaker" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kimberly Baker,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a food systems and safety program team director at Clemson University. It’s more common to have contaminated greens “when the field is in close proximity to livestock farms or feedlots where animals are being held in densely populated conditions,” Roszkowski explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arizona and California are big producers of leafy greens in the United States and are often near large cattle operations, according to Detwiler. E. coli, salmonella, or listeria can be introduced to the crops through contaminated irrigation water from nearby cattle farms, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Runoff from manure lagoons can seep into irrigation canals and contaminate fields with deadly bacteria like E. coli O157:H7,” Detwiler continued. Manure lagoons are large pits where livestock waste is stored, per &lt;a href="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Environmental" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Environmental&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" America" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccidentsFactsheet-ManureLagoons-1.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt; America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And it’s not only contaminated water that can be a problem. Some farms use unregulated water sources to irrigate the fields. “Some farms use untreated or minimally treated surface water from rivers, lakes or canals, increasing the risk of contamination,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it’s time to harvest, there are added risks for pathogens and bacteria to come in contact with lettuce. “Contamination can occur through human handling, contaminated equipment or water used in post-harvest processes to transport, produce or remove soil,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the processing plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are opportunities for pathogens to come in contact with leafy greens once they reach a processing plant. The greens you get in a bag don’t typically come from one field but from multiple farms, complicating traceability and increasing contamination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens are processed in a centralized area and distributed — which is convenient for all the companies involved in the process— but not ideal from a food safety standpoint. “Greens from different farms are mixed, washed and packaged together, so one contaminated leaf can impact thousands of bags across multiple states,” Detwiler explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lettuce is washed in large vats, added &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rosemary Trout," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rosemary Trout,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; associate professor and program director of Culinary Arts &amp;amp; Food Science at Drexel University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What you may not suspect, according to Trout, is that “plant foods are usually more often associated with foodborne illness than animal products.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the journey to store shelves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping the greens cold is necessary to prevent any pathogens from growing and spreading. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “Not keeping the greens consistently cold throughout the process of harvesting, processing and transporting can cause bacterial growth to occur.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, refrigeration doesn’t eliminate the chance of pathogens; it can help slow them down. “Refrigeration slows bacterial growth but does not kill bacteria, meaning contaminated greens can still cause illness, even if stored properly,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will washing prewashed salad greens help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re thinking, “W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ell, I’ll wash my prewashed greens for extra safety measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” don’t. Washing greens at home doesn’t make them safer because water won’t remove the pathogens, Detwiler said. Rinsing prewashed greens can introduce pathogens that may be lurking on your counter or sink. “Prewashed greens should not be rewashed at home, as doing so can introduce contamination if the sink, utensils, equipment or hands of the preparer are not properly cleaned or sanitized,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Washing greens can remove pesticides, but it's not been proven to be effective in removing pathogens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bacteria or pathogens aren’t obvious and can’t be seen. “If greens are contaminated with pathogens, they cannot be detected by sight, smell or taste … and can’t be removed by washing,” Baker explained. According to Detwiler, “Bacteria like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can form biofilms that help them stick to the surface of the leaves [and] once attached, these bacteria do not simply rinse off.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harmful pathogens need to be cooked to be eliminated, as heat kills them, said Detwiler. A big issue with lettuce is it’s usually eaten raw, not cooked, “making it challenging to reduce the risk of foodborne illness,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for buying bagged greens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you still prefer buying bagged greens for the convenience, there are several precautions to take. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for recalls &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before you purchase any salad greens, check if there are any recalls, advised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detwiler and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Stay updated on recalls via the FDA and CDC websites,” Detwiler said. “If your greens are part of an outbreak, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;throw them away immediately.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check expiration dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts say you should look at the expiration dates before purchasing. Trout advises to only buy what you will eat within a day or two. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid bags with excess moisture that look wet, as damp environments are a haven for bacteria to thrive, Detwiler said. “Inspect the package to ensure the lettuce looks fresh, without wilting or discoloration, as these signs may indicate improper storage or reduced freshness,” Baker said. You also want to stay away from any bags that have slimy leaves, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski added&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize temperature changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you’ve purchased greens, don’t let them sit in a hot car or garage or out on the counter. “Avoid drastic changes in temperature when transporting them from the store and when preparing a meal,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “This leads to condensation and creates a moist and warm environment that can encourage both spoilage and bacterial growth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68499306e4b03de6beaf7ff0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens should be kept refrigerated at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, say Detwiler and Trout. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy heads of lettuce &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Purchasing a head of lettuce or a bunch of spinach may have the extra step of rinsing and drying before tossing in a salad bowl or stir-frying, but you could be minimizing the risk of lurking pathogens. “Whole heads of lettuce or spinach have less surface area for contamination compared to pre-cut, mixed bagged greens,” Detwiler said.

advises people who think they have Covid to stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A World Health Organisation spokesman said: “Currently approved Covid vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant against symptomatic and severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite a concurrent increase in cases and hospitalizations in some countries where NB.1.8.1 is widespread, current data does not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctor Mohamed Imran Lakhi, said: “People commonly report a severe sore throat, persistent fatigue, mild cough, fever, muscle aches, and nasal congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some also experience digestive issues like nausea or diarrhoea, which isn’t always typical with Covid variants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Naveed Asif, GP at The London General Practice, said the variant has a distinctive symptom, a severe sore throat known as a “razor blade sensation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a sharp, stabbing pain when you swallow, often at the back of the throat. Doctors say it can be treated in the same way with rest, fluids and painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms persist or get worse, or if you are worried about you or someone else you can speak to a GP or call 111. If someone is in serious distress, for example struggling to breathe, you should call 999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UKHSA said: “You might have seen news or social media conversations about the Covid variant NB.1.8.1, which you might know as the ‘Nimbus variant’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NB.1.8.1 has been detected in small numbers in the UK to date, but international data suggests that it is growing as a proportion of al Covid cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on the available information so far however, there is no evidence to suggest that this variant causes more severe disease than previous variants, of that the vaccines in current use will be less effective against it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 10:33:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9yeU9lanFxWXRyYjhVa2hxdjFkQmNVWl9ka1JjREpNU05NUXdLd2tKTHJSS0RxVTcyZ1JjcThJbHNydDl5YnBFSUlWTjZ5WlZrRFNEdFcwVHRjbXh0aVk5ZzVWZUVGd2NhVmR3cmYyaGctT2s1N214Y29wQjI</guid></item><item><title>科学家表示，气候变化导致导致感染的真菌蔓延- ABC新闻 | Climate change leads to spread of infection-causing fungi, scientists say - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPWi1VaDBlVVlvV2dfY214d3ZXbDZBYVJ0aG44Sm5WNEtyeGJoQUdEQTdRN0p6RzZxRXFXNVVRenpNMWVEQjlhWE03VjhDNHdSal9mZXVZMVNTOGhmSGx5Si1PYlRaTmVsMmpJQ2V6dllmMnJrZW5QX19HOTJ1bmdHVDlNYnZ1QzUwSENTaUVoQWMzb0NPS044NDJZc0FyWWZRQ2xuZmdDQTNtMzjSAbABQVVfeXFMTnBENElzVmcwRjdPS3JGY1RRTHNrTlV1VC1CUzQ0cjBubVJGaFR5OEZUc1JiVkFPNEZKZldKTWctb1BxVVRBaUY2bjRSTUpLUmNoVndSMFVFWm9UOXdpdWlwanY2TmFNWUJ3TTVYeHJ0SVlVWlk1cGJyZWMwWGZ6cmZ6YmxtLWdIZDZTTzZOTE42bF93elJCSVR0NkVwdm1ob0l4bXRnVE1hcWhNSG5pQTE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/climate-change" id="_ap_link_Climate change_ClimateChange_" target="_blank"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;

"We typically thought of the sperm as a bag of DNA on a tail. But as we've started to realise, it's quite a complex cell – there's a lot of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3015006/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;[other] genetic information in there&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost 200 years later, in 1869, Johannes Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician and biologist, was studying human white blood cells collected from pus left on soiled hospital bandages when he &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7268995/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;discovered what he called "nuclein"&lt;/a&gt; inside the nuclei. The term "nuclein" was later changed to "nucleic acid" and eventually became "deoxyribonucleic acid" – or "DNA". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since then, our understanding of sperm has moved on leaps and bounds. But &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000953" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;much still remains a mystery&lt;/a&gt;, says Watkins. As scientists have started to better understand early embryonic development, he adds, they are realising that sperm doesn't just pass the father's chromosomes on, but also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-025-01815-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;epigenetic information&lt;/a&gt;, an extra layer of information that affects how and when the genes should be used. "It can really influence how the embryo develops and potentially the lifelong trajectory of the offspring that those sperm generate," says Watkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;It turns out that what's driving the system is female evolution – and males are just trying to keep up – Scott Pitnick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sperm cells begin to form from puberty onwards, made in vessels within the testicles called seminiferous tubules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you look inside the testes where the sperm are made, it starts as just a round cell that looks pretty much like anything else," says Watkins.

However, this only lasts a short time before returning to normal. This is where the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26843/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cortical reaction&lt;/a&gt; comes in. A sudden release of calcium causes the zona pellucida – the egg's "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2528931/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;extracellular coat&lt;/a&gt;" – to become hardened, creating an impenetrable barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;What external factors affect male fertility and why.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One way researchers are hoping to shed light on sperm is by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18005" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;studying species other than our own&lt;/a&gt;, says Scott Pitnick, a professor of biology at Syracuse University in New York. Human sperm cells are microscopic, so we can't see them with the naked eye. But some fruit fly species produce sperm cells &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18005" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;20 times their own body length&lt;/a&gt;. That would be like a man producing sperm the length of a 40m (130ft) python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Why do males in some species make a few giant sperm?" asks Pitnick. "The answer, it turns out, is because females have evolved reproductive tracts that favour them." That's "not really much of an answer", he adds, because it's just the redirects the question: why have females evolved this way? "We still don't understand that at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Research suggests sperm counts are tumbling globally and the decline appears to be accelerating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it does teach us that sperm as they exist in the male body is only half the story, says Pitnick. "There's a massive sex bias historically in science. There's been this obscenely biased male focus on male traits. But it turns out that what's driving the system is female evolution – and males are just trying to keep up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It turns out the female reproductive tract is this incredibly, rapidly evolving environment," says Pitnick, "and we don't know much about what sperm do inside the female. That is the big, hidden world. I think the female reproductive tract is the greatest unexplored frontier for sexual selection, theory and speciation [the process by which &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/speciation-the-origin-of-new-species-26230527/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;new species are formed&lt;/a&gt;]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The fruit fly's long-tailed sperm, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02587-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests Pitnick&lt;/a&gt;, could be considered an ornament – much like a deer's antlers or a peacock's tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ornaments are a "sort of a weapon in evolution", explains Pitnick. More than just a defence from predators, ornaments like antlers and horns often have two roles to play. "A lot of these weapons are about sex, and usually male-male competition. The [fruit fly's] long sperm flagellum really meets the definitional criteria of an ornament. We think the female tract has traits that bias fertilisation in favour of some sperm phenotypes over others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We know a lot about pre-mating sexual selection, Pitnick says. "Say, it's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20240902-how-controlled-burns-can-help-wildlife" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prairie chickens dancing&lt;/a&gt; out on a grassland, or a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p023wbh0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bird of paradise displaying&lt;/a&gt; in a rainforest. It's motion, it's colour, it's smells?" Processing this sensory input, explains Pitnick, leads to decision making – whether the pair mate or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But, Pitnick says, the sexual selection that goes on inside the female after mating – and how this drives the evolution of sperm – largely remains a mystery. "We still understand very little about the genetics of ornaments and preferences," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lj3gts.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Sperm are so tiny that they can be difficult to study.

"Sperm are not mature when they finish developing in the testes, they're not done developing." Complex – and critical – interactions occur between the sperm and the female reproductive tract, he says.

(It's also worth noting that many people around the world are not having as many children as they want for other reasons too, such as the prohibitive cost of parenthood, as a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynq459wxgo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recent United Nation population Fund report highlighted&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"With all those moving parts, there are so many things that could go wrong," says Hannah Morgan, a post-doctoral research associate in maternal and fetal health at the University of Manchester, UK. "It could be a mechanism: it doesn't swim very well, so it can't get to the egg. Or it could be something more intricate within the head of the sperm, or other regions of the sperm. It's so specialised in so many different ways, that lots of little things can go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One way to see if a man may be infertile is to look inside the sperm, says Morgan.
