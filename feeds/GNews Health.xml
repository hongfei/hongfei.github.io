                                        A rising beauty trend has Americans massaging their scalps and flocking to high-end head spas—sometimes for hundreds of dollars a session—all in pursuit of healthier hair, even if dermatologists aren't convinced most people need the help, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/style/scalp-care-beauty-trends-2025.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The scalp has emerged as the latest focus of the beauty world, and the trend, fueled by TikTok and other social media, has seen a significant spike in interest: According to market insights company Spate, online searches and posts about "scalp serum" jumped 77% over the past year, while "scalp massagers" and "scalp treatment" also saw notable increases.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            

                            &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Influencers are documenting their intensive scalp routines—sometimes involving hours of massage or the use of expensive serums—and sharing with hundreds of thousands of followers, helping to drive the trend. Many major hair-care brands, from drugstore staples to high-end labels, have launched scalp-focused products. Beyonce's Cecred brand famously sells out of its Restoring Hair &amp;amp; Edge Drops serum; it reportedly moved one bottle every 16 seconds from last November through July.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        While some dermatologists acknowledge that scalp care can improve hair health, they caution that elaborate routines aren't necessary for most people. "If you're not having a problem, there shouldn't be this huge drive to have to get all this stuff to put on your scalp," says Maryanne Senna, director of the Hair Loss Center of Excellence at Lahey Hospital &amp;amp; Medical Center.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                
                                
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Still, the allure of scalp care persists, with head spas—especially those offering microscopic analysis of hair follicles and customized treatments—drawing crowds in cities like New York and Los Angeles. Prices for these treatments range widely, with some sessions costing upward of $300. Even if they're not terribly helpful for most people, it's not likely you'll hurt yourself in any way by getting a scalp massage or similar treatment. "The only real danger is to a person's wallet," Senna tells the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a69073403/scalp-steaming-benefits/"&gt;some dermatologists recommend&lt;/a&gt; "scalp steaming," while &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/shop/scalp-care-guide-t289360"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes the two most important things you can do for your scalp: Keep it clean and protected from the sun.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                



                            &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;The Obesity Epidemic: What Really Happened in the 1980s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've seen the arguments. Seed oils are poison. Sugar is the devil. Fast food destroyed America. The government ruined everything. Or maybe it's all Big Pharma's fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone's got a villain. Everyone's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth? Multiple things broke at once. Around 1980, several massive changes hit simultaneously, and we're still living with the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Data Doesn't Lie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-right"&gt;&lt;img alt="obesity_trends_by_age_sex.png" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1503733/large/obesity_trends_by_age_sex.png?1764524981" title="obesity_trends_by_age_sex.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;NHANES surveys&lt;/a&gt; show something remarkable: obesity rates were relatively flat for decades, then suddenly bent upward between 1976–1980. Not a gradual drift—a sharp inflection point. Adult obesity jumped from roughly 15% to over 30% in just two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not normal. That's not genetics. That's environmental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Actually Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Government Picked the Wrong Enemy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1977, the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/about-dietary-guidelines/history-dietary-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;McGovern Committee&lt;/a&gt; told Americans to slash fat intake to 30% of calories and replace it with carbohydrates. Three years later, the first official Dietary Guidelines made it policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food industry listened. Boy, did they listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, everything was "low-fat." Cookies, yogurt, salad dressing, frozen dinners. But fat makes food taste good, so manufacturers replaced it with something else: sugar. Lots of sugar. And refined starches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? Hyper-processed, hyper-palatable foods that were technically "low-fat" but absolutely terrible for metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;High-Fructose Corn Syrup Went Supernova&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)03883-7/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;HFCS consumption increased roughly 1,000% between 1970 and 1990&lt;/a&gt;. It was cheap, stable, and sweeter than regular sugar. Food manufacturers dumped it into everything—soda, bread, ketchup, crackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total added sugar intake skyrocketed. We didn't peak until around 2000, but the damage was already done by the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Portions Exploded&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/" target="_blank"&gt;USDA data show&lt;/a&gt; average calorie intake rose 200–300 calories per day from the late 1970s to early 2000s. That's an extra meal's worth of energy, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald's didn't introduce Super Size until the 1990s, but portions were already growing throughout the 1980s. Bigger sodas. Bigger burgers. Bigger everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grain-based desserts, soft drinks, and fast food drove most of the increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We Stopped Moving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift from manual labor to desk jobs accelerated through the 1960s–1980s. More people drove everywhere. Fewer people walked or biked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came home computers and video games. Television watching was already high, but the 1980s added new reasons to sit still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids especially. Recess got shorter. PE programs got cut. Screen time went up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Smoking Declined (Yes, This Matters)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adult smoking rates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/topics/tobacco-use.htm" target="_blank" title=""&gt;dropped from 42% in 1965 to 25% by the early 1990s&lt;/a&gt;. That's overwhelmingly good news—smoking kills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But quitting typically adds 4–5 kg. At the population level, that contributed roughly 1–2 percentage points to obesity prevalence. Not the main driver, but not nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Everything Else&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restaurant eating increased. Ultra-processed foods were engineered to maximize consumption. Sleep patterns changed. Stress increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some researchers point to endocrine disruptors, though evidence for the 1980s timeframe remains speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204371" target="_blank"&gt;Peer-reviewed analyses&lt;/a&gt; attribute roughly 50–70% of the calorie increase to greater intake of refined grains, added sugars, and added fats (mostly seed oils used in processed and restaurant food). The rest comes from reduced physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; seed oils. It wasn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; sugar. It wasn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the government or &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; fast food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all of it. At once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1980s created a perfect storm: official dietary policy that backfired spectacularly, cheap hyper-palatable processed foods, massive portion increases, and a simultaneous collapse in physical activity. The effect was rapid and population-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why This Matters Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what actually happened matters because the simplistic answers—ban seed oils, ban sugar, ban carbs—miss the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food environment changed fundamentally. We made calories cheaper, more available, more rewarding, and easier to overconsume. We built cities around cars instead of walking. We replaced recess with standardized tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing this requires addressing multiple systems simultaneously. Better food policy. Better urban design. Better food labeling. Better education about ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One villain makes for better social media engagement. But multiple causes make for better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1980s broke something. We can't fix it by picking just one scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;

Early on, doctors told her that issues like laughter-triggered headaches were nothing to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Chiari malformation, which is a rare condition impacting around 300,000 Americans, or one in 1,000, causes the lower part of the brain to push down into the spinal canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pressure, which disrupts nerves and the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including headaches that worsen with straining, neck pain, balance issues and, in severe cases, coordination or vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Gunnoe, uncovering the cause of her symptoms took more than 14 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As years went on, she began to experience tingling in her arms and fingers, bouts of nausea, heat intolerance and episodes in which her vision would dim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled one incident at work when she became so dizzy and overwhelmed by heat that she collapsed in a restroom, saying she was 'unable to get up' until her fiancé arrived to take her home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That crisis finally led to a neurology referral and the MRI that revealed a 4mm Chiari malformation. Even then, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/onbrandbyshelli/"&gt;doctors initially said &lt;/a&gt;surgery wasn't needed. But Gunnoe's symptoms kept worsening, as simple movements like bending or standing provoked dizziness or instability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shelli Gunnoe, 26, from South Carolina, was diagnosed with a Chiari malformation after more than a decade of confusing symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A follow-up MRI complicated matters further, as a neurologist suggested her symptoms more closely resembled pseudotumor cerebri, a condition where pressure inside the skull rises abnormally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, along with enlarged brain ventricles (a network of fluid-filled cavities within the brain that produce, contain and circulate cerebrospinal fluid) and her earlier diagnosis of hydrocephalus, (a condition when there is too much fluid in the brain, causing swelling and pressure) hinted at a deeper issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Deep down, I knew something wasn't adding up,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors now believe some of her symptoms may trace all the way back to birth. Chiari malformation is usually present at birth (congenital), although symptoms may not appear until childhood or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gunnoe was delivered by emergency C-section because she was breech, 'upright with my head positioned in my mother's rib cage,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She inhaled a large amount of amniotic fluid and initially needed NICU care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although her parents hoped for a routine infancy afterward, she soon required a hip brace for developmental support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also 'extremely irritable and only soothed by being held,' and her parents worried her head looked unusually large. Despite their concerns, a neurologist dismissed the issue at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years later, in 2009, Gunnoe was taken to hospital for chronic migraines. CT and MRI scans revealed mild hydrocephalus, and she was treated with medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early on, doctors told Gunnoe that issues like laughter-triggered headaches were nothing to worry about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;That crisis finally led to a neurology referral and the MRI that revealed a 4mm Chiari malformation, pictured here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chiari malformation, which is a rare condition impacting around 300,000 Americans, causes the lower part of the brain to push down into the spinal canal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout childhood and her teen years she fainted often and lived with intense fatigue and headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors kept telling me it was my weight,' she said. But after losing 50lbs, the symptoms persisted. In January 2022, immediately after standing up from a bike in a cycling class, she fainted again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms escalated in the years that followed: blurry vision, vertigo, crushing fatigue, and mornings when she felt 'frozen and unable to wake.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She described episodes that 'didn't feel normal for someone my age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she finally received a clear diagnosis of Chiari malformation in November 2024, she felt both 'relieved, but frustrated.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neurologist used a skull model to show how her cerebellar tonsils were being pulled downward into the opening at the base of her skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He explained that mine are pushed down further than they should be, slipping through the opening where the spinal cord runs,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because they're squeezed into a space that's too tight, they press on my spinal cord and disrupt the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When that flow is slowed or blocked, she added, 'it irritates the nerves and causes many of the symptoms I've been dealing with.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gunnoe was delivered by emergency C-section because she was breech, 'upright with my head positioned in my mother's rib cage,' she explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Throughout childhood and her teen years, Gunnoe fainted often and lived with intense fatigue and headaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, Gunnoe is being closely monitored while her neurologist determines the best course of action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of my combination of Chiari, hydrocephalus history, enlarged ventricles, and possible pseudotumor, my case is still being evaluated,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While waiting, she manages her symptoms through pacing, careful activity choices and prioritizing rest and hydration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm still very much in the 'watch and wait' stage,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the uncertainty, she tries to live fully. She still experiences dizziness when standing, visual disturbances, sensory overload and difficulty tolerating certain movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simple tasks, looking upward, bending down or standing too quickly, can trigger symptoms instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even so, she continues teaching full-time, creates online content and models, and is training, with thoughtful modifications, in hopes of participating in the Hyrox race, a global, indoor fitness competition that combines eight 0.62m runs with eight different functional fitness workout stations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a strange balance,' she said, 'acknowledging the reality of a neurological condition while refusing to let it shrink my goals or identity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Her symptoms escalated in the years that followed: blurry vision, vertigo, crushing fatigue, and mornings when she felt 'frozen and unable to wake'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite the uncertainty, Gunnoe tries to live fully. She is hopeful of participating in the Hyrox race: a global, indoor fitness competition that combines eight 1km runs with eight different functional fitness workout stations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gunnoe hopes her story encourages others not to ignore their symptoms or allow them to be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Invisible illnesses don't always look dramatic,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People see me lifting weights, teaching, modelling, smiling online, and they don't see the hours I spend navigating dizziness, pressure or exhaustion behind the scenes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wants to speak especially to women who feel overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'You can advocate for yourself.

When we talk about “parasites” in this context, we are mainly referring to intestinal parasites; organisms that live inside the digestive tract. Some parasites feed on nutrients, others irritate the intestinal lining, and some feed on blood and can cause anemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these infections vary widely in severity, the symptoms they cause can be equally diverse and often nonspecific. Still, certain patterns have stronger scientific backing. In a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8AjFD2mM9mc" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, popular health educator Dr. Eric Berg, shared 5 symptoms that may signal the presence of parasites in the body, and two natural remedies that can help get rid of them. Below we explore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How Lifestyle Choices Can Increase Your Risk of Stomach Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How dangerous are parasites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000629.htm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Parasite infections &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;occur when parasites enter the body and begin living, reproducing, or feeding inside you. This usually happens through contaminated food, water, soil, insect bites, poor hygiene, or contact with infected animals/humans. Parasitic infections are not trivial; they can translate into serious health burdens, especially if recurrent or untreated. Parasites can cause damage in multiple ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some physically attach to the intestinal wall (or other organs), feed on blood or nutrients, and thereby deprive the host of essential nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some disturb the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8191/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; intestinal lining&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and interfere with absorption of nutrients, resulting in malnutrition even if diet is adequate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic infections can trigger inflammation (in gut, liver, bladder, or other organs), cause tissue damage (e.g., scarring, fibrosis, cyst formation), or even lead parasites to migrate to and damage distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In heavy or uncontrolled infestations, especially in people with weak immunity, parasites can cause life‑threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Five warning signs you may have parasites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Unexplained sugar cravings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Berg, unexplained sugar cravings, especially for dairy, is a sign of parasites. Dr. Berg adds, “Parasites love sugar, especially milk sugar. If you crave that, you could have parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Grinding teeth at night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night-time teeth grinding may also be connected to parasitic stress on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites can release toxins that irritate the gut–brain axis, triggering restlessness, tension, and involuntary muscle activity during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Itchy skin at night (especially in private parts) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night-time itching around the anal or genital area is one of the classic signs of parasites such as pinworms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites tend to be more active at night, which is why symptoms often intensify when you lie down to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Extreme bloating after eating- despite what you eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience constant bloating or gas regardless of the meal, parasites may be interfering with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of them reside in the small intestine, just below the stomach, where they:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- ferment food, producing gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- cause inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- steal essential nutrients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can leave you feeling overfull, heavy, or distended after even small meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Iron deficient anemia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain parasites feed directly on blood or damage the intestinal lining, reducing iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this can lead to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- chronic fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- pale skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;- low stamina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Berg emphasizes that parasites can literally “steal your iron,” causing anemia in otherwise healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How parasites are actually diagnosed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitic infections are best confirmed through laboratory testing, since symptoms alone can be misleading and often overlap with other digestive or nutritional problems. The most common method is a stool examination, where a lab looks for parasite eggs, larvae, or cysts under a microscope. In many modern labs, more advanced stool antigen tests and PCR panels are used to detect parasites with higher accuracy. These diagnostic methods allow doctors to pinpoint the exact parasite and offer appropriate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not substitute for professional medical advice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPdVBxZ3NVZkhlS0U2M193UVMyZm95NVhCVk5NSzMwYTgzSndYbHJkdVBFWFJOU0tyd1hSN0Zpa3dYRjFTMDRFbnhIRXlpLWYzTkJ4OWEwRWZTX3VwUlo3YzUwYzc3c25DS015QUI0WW8zMEtVSWNHLTNnaDdEQklmVmJXdXozc2NPNndUSEhFb3g3T1ZYWEQ1YjdTMWpKcVBhTllmalhadk1aaWs4T0RFMFN3R2dDWUJ2aWVKQlYwWUYyM3VPckVzb2ltS2JlSk9UaDFFdkI5MnYzZmVwc1pmZ24tcVhyVGJhcF9XMUNBQTliMkhMOFV6Q2pR</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心的破坏-黑客新闻</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46097102</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 15:33:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTFAxWmNxRGRLeGN0bFVrME5GQmtSVmE1cmhzWW1ZMW1KTi1hZExrU0trY0FoUmVXUzFUOFpTNHR6XzJUUDlhQV9XS0d2QklLTDhqWDZoZ0RUaks</guid></item><item><title>可以默默增加心力衰竭风险的5种常见假日习惯-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-common-holiday-habits-that-can-silently-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure/articleshow/125668291.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holiday season is a time for family, festivities, and indulgent meals, but for people with heart conditions, it can also bring hidden risks that often go unnoticed. Cardiologist &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRj-49lALbj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Dr Dmitry Yaranov recently shared on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that small changes in daily routines during holidays, such as altered sleep patterns, heavier meals, alcohol consumption, travel stress, and emotional excitement, can quietly trigger heart failure flare-ups. Many patients experience preventable complications during festive periods simply because they overlook subtle warning signs or dismiss early symptoms. Dr Yaranov emphasises that being mindful of your body, recognising early changes, and taking prompt action can help prevent serious issues. With the right awareness and precautions, it is possible to enjoy celebrations safely without compromising heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 ways typical &lt;keyword id="22125639" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="holiday-habits" source="keywords"&gt;holiday habits&lt;/keyword&gt; may put your heart at risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hidden sodium in festive meals&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High sodium intake is one of the most common holiday triggers for heart issues. Traditional holiday dishes such as stuffing, gravy, ham, canned broths, and many restaurant-prepared foods contain large amounts of salt. Sodium causes the body to retain fluid, which increases blood volume and places extra stress on the heart. Even one particularly salty meal can lead to overnight fluid accumulation, resulting in swelling, breathlessness, or sudden weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For individuals with heart failure, carefully monitoring salt intake and reading labels for hidden sodium is essential. Moderation doesn’t mean missing out entirely; it means making smarter choices like limiting processed foods or choosing lower-salt alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Breathing changes after meals&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important early warning sign is a change in breathing patterns following large meals. When the stomach is full, the increased venous return sends more blood to the heart, forcing it to work harder. Dr Yaranov notes that new shortness of breath, difficulty lying flat, or waking up feeling breathless after a meal can indicate fluid retention. These symptoms should not be ignored as they can precede more serious heart complications. Paying attention to breathing changes, eating smaller portions, and allowing the body time to digest before lying down can help reduce unnecessary stress on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alcohol can worsen heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption is often part of holiday celebrations, but even small amounts can be risky for people with heart failure. Alcohol can lower blood pressure, trigger arrhythmias, and interact with medications such as diuretics, blood pressure drugs, and heart rhythm medications. Dr Yaranov warns that even modest alcohol intake can cause sudden complications in patients taking these medications. For those with heart failure, the safest approach is to avoid alcohol altogether during holiday festivities. Choosing non-alcoholic alternatives or enjoying festive drinks in moderation while monitoring for any symptoms can make a meaningful difference in heart safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatigue shouldn’t be ignored&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holidays often involve late nights, high activity levels, and emotional excitement, all of which can contribute to fatigue. While it is normal to feel tired occasionally, unusual or excessive tiredness may be an early sign that the heart is struggling to cope with additional stress. Dr Yaranov emphasises that persistent fatigue should never be dismissed, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms like swelling or shortness of breath. Prioritising rest, pacing activities, and maintaining a consistent sleep routine are important strategies to help the heart handle holiday pressures without being overworked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Swelling and rapid weight gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudden swelling or rapid weight gain is a clear indicator that fluid is building up in the body, a common problem in heart failure. Dr Yaranov explains that a 2–3 pound increase in weight overnight or new swelling in the ankles, hands, or abdomen is usually a red flag. These changes rarely occur from a single heavy meal; they often reflect underlying heart stress or fluid retention. Monitoring weight daily and checking for swelling can help catch early signs of decompensation. Acting promptly by contacting a doctor or adjusting medications under medical guidance can prevent serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the risks, Dr Yaranov reassures patients that it is possible to enjoy the holidays safely. The key is awareness, moderation, and timely action. He advises taking medications as prescribed, monitoring for subtle warning signs, and seeking medical attention immediately if unusual symptoms appear. “You can absolutely enjoy Thanksgiving with your family. Just stay aware of how you feel, know your limits, and take symptoms seriously,” he says. By staying mindful of hidden sodium, changes in breathing, alcohol intake, fatigue, and sudden swelling, those with heart concerns can celebrate the season without compromising their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is intended purely for informational use and is not a substitute for professional medical, nutritional or scientific advice.

                &lt;p&gt;As much fun and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cannabis-can-help-relieve-chronic-low-back-pain-major-trial-finds-2000665517"&gt;helpful&lt;/a&gt; as cannabis can be, every drug has its potential tradeoffs. Case in point, a study out this week finds that more Americans are coming down with a stomach-churning side effect of long-term use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago examined emergency department visits from across the country. They found evidence that ER visits for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)—a condition characterized by constant, painful bouts of vomiting—have noticeably risen in the last several years, especially among younger adults. The researchers say that more doctors need to be aware of this debilitating, but ultimately treatable, health problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is real, and it’s becoming a more routine part of emergency medicine in the U.S.,” lead author James Swartz, a professor at UIC’s Jane Addams College of Social Work, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The scromiting syndrome&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21665-cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome"&gt;CHS&lt;/a&gt; will experience cyclical periods of intense cramps, nausea, and vomiting. An acute episode can last one to two days, and the experience is often so intolerable that people will scream out in pain as they’re vomiting—a phenomenon that’s been given the charming nickname “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6690288/#:~:text=Young%20people%2C%20typically%20between%20the,to%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Cscromiting%E2%80%9D."&gt;scromiting&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;CHS typically happens in people who have been using cannabis chronically for at least several years. Scientists aren’t sure why it develops, but it might be caused by the overstimulation of native cannabinoid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. It’s thought to be a rare complication, but recent research has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871624013437"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that cases of CHS have been increasing in the U.S. and other places where cannabis legalization has expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest study, the researchers analyzed data from a nationwide sample of ER visits in the U.S. between 2016 and 2022. Until recently, doctors couldn’t diagnose CHS as a distinct medical condition for record-keeping and insurance purposes. So the researchers instead looked for diagnoses related to cyclical vomiting syndrome (severe, sudden vomiting that can’t be explained by other known causes) and cannabis use; cases where both diagnoses were present were used as a proxy for CHS.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;During the study period, roughly 100,000 cases of suspected CHS were documented. Prior to the covid-19 pandemic, they found, annual rates of CHS were steady. Starting in 2020, however, suspected cases of CHS seen in the ER surged. And though cases did decline in 2022, they were still above the pre-pandemic baseline. Importantly, cases of cannabis-related health problems in general also rose during that same period, while cases of cyclical vomiting syndrome without any cannabis link did not, further suggesting a real rise in CHS.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841769"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000691635" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000691635" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000691635" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/CHS-chart.jpg" alt="Chs Chart" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/CHS-chart.jpg 1325w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/CHS-chart-336x161.jpg 336w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/CHS-chart-1280x613.jpg 1280w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/CHS-chart-768x368.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/CHS-chart-672x322.jpg 672w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/11/CHS-chart-960x460.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000691635" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The chart shows that the likelihood of CHS among people diagnosed with cannabis-related health problems at the ER rose over time. © Swartz et al./JAMA Network Open&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this study can’t directly answer why CHS is becoming more common, the timing of this surge indicates that covid-19 probably played a role. At the same time, ongoing factors like the growing legalization of cannabis in the U.S. and perhaps the increased amounts of THC in today’s cannabis strains are also likely important, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 pandemic likely catalyzed the rise in CHS through stress, isolation, and increased cannabis use,” the authors wrote. “After peaking in 2021, CHS incidence declined but plateaued above prepandemic levels, suggesting sustained structural or clinical drivers.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;How to stay safe from CHS&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;CHS is a horrific experience, but it’s one that we know how to effectively manage and treat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some reason, hot baths and showers can temporarily relieve an acute episode. The only way to truly keep it from happening, though, is to stop using cannabis altogether. It might take weeks, but the symptoms will eventually stop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while the rate of CHS may be climbing, it’s still a relatively rare side effect, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our findings shouldn’t be interpreted as a reason to panic, but they do reinforce that cannabis is not risk-free, especially at higher doses and with long-term, heavy use,” Swartz said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, CHS was &lt;a href="https://adai.uw.edu/icd-10-code-chs/"&gt;officially added&lt;/a&gt; to the latest edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the codebook that’s used worldwide for diagnostic and billing purposes. So it’s now much easier for doctors to diagnose the condition and for researchers to track its prevalence. That said, doctors and hospitals will still need to know that CHS exists in order to make a timely diagnosis, the study authors say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Given frequent misdiagnosis and costly, unnecessary testing, greater clinical awareness is needed,” the authors wrote. They also argue that more research is needed to figure out the exact causes of CHS and why only some long-term users develop it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Days like these, I’m glad that I only occasionally indulge in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_icky"&gt;sticky icky.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

During that study, the researchers found that metformin traveled to an area of the brain called the ventromedial hypothalamus, where it essentially turned off Rap1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The researchers then bred mice that didn’t have Rap1 and found that metformin had no impact on their blood sugar management, even though other medications did. Overall, the findings suggest that metformin has a big impact on the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But why does this matter?

The medication is designed to help control the amount of glucose (or sugar) in the blood. “Metformin has been used for decades to treat diabetes, although there has been extensive research on its use in other conditions like cancer and PCOS,” says &lt;a href="https://phmtox.msu.edu/people/alanjami" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://phmtox.msu.edu/people/alanjami" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jamie K.

At the same time, the drug increases the body’s response to insulin, a hormone that controls the amount of glucose in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“There are likely more complex mechanisms also at play,” Alan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Metformin is being explored for other health conditions, too. “Because metformin can pass through the bloodstream and into the brain, scientists have also studied whether it may be an effective treatment for depression and neurological disorders,” says &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kelly Johnson-Arbor, M.D." data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Kelly Johnson-Arbor, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="," data-node-id="11.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; a toxicologist at MedStar Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-does-this-matter" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Even though metformin has been widely used for decades, the details about how it works haven’t been totally figured out. “Amazingly, even though metformin is a drug that has been used for more than six decades in the U.S., we still do not fully understand how it works,” says &lt;a href="https://rwjmg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=115212" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://rwjmg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=115212" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christoph Buettner, M.D., Ph.D." data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Christoph Buettner, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “It’s the most prescribed diabetes drug in the world.”&lt;br data-node-id="13.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;These findings suggest it could impact the brain, liver, and gut. “It is valuable to learn how this works in the brain,” Alan says. “There is so much we don’t know about satiety and central mechanisms behind appetite and blood sugar control.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The findings “change the way we think about metformin,” Dr. Buettner says. “It supports the important role the brain plays in glucose metabolism,” he continues. “It also may explain why metformin causes modest weight loss, changes in appetite and hunger, and possible effects on brain aging or cognition, as these are brain effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Metformin is also “extremely affordable,” Alan says. “It’s oral, so no injections are needed,” she adds. (By comparison, Ozempic and Mounjaro are injectable medications.) As a result, finding new ways to use it or similar treatments would be a big win for the diabetes community and beyond, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;These findings could potentially lead to new and better treatments for a range of diseases, according to Dr. Johnson-Arbor. “By studying the effects of metformin outside of the liver, scientists may be able to find new applications of this decades-old drug, such as novel treatments for diabetes, neurological disorders, and heart disease,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-happens-now" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;What happens now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;These are new findings, so more research is needed.

Global estimates approximate that biotinidase deficiency ranges anywhere from one in 40,000 people to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560607/#:~:text=Biotinidase%20deficiency%20is%20a%20rare,the%20Kingdom%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;one in 60,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, per NCBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though rare, there is an elevated risk for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/26/can-pregnant-women-eat-deli-meat/75594937007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;people who are pregnant&lt;/a&gt; or breastfeeding to experience biotin deficiency. As for why this may occur, during pregnancy, your body metabolizes biotin faster, Bawer explained. When breastfeeding, “you tend to excrete more biotin and therefore are at higher risk of being low,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Individuals with chronic alcoholism, and people taking long-term antiseizure medications, are also at risk for biotin deficiency, Keen added. “These can interfere with biotin metabolism or absorption,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Who benefits from biotin supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Biotin supplements are used to prevent or treat biotin deficiency,” and individuals with a biotin deficiency may benefit from taking them, said Bal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Biotin supplements should always be taken under medical supervision, underscores &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/doctors/sarah-hemeida/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Sarah Hemeida&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MPH, an assistant professor and family physician at UT Southwestern Family Medicine Department and the co-director of Empowher Health, a women's health education program focused on dispelling cultural misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The adequate intake (AI) for biotin is 30 micrograms a day for adults and eight to 12 micrograms a day for children, Bal said. However, depending on the patient and the severity of their biotin deficiency, dosages will vary. For example, in certain cases, treatment could require taking a dosage of biotin supplements as high as 10mg per day, Bal noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Biotin supplements may offer benefits during pregnancy and times of lactation, when it’s especially important to maintain healthy biotin levels, Hemeida said. There are risks to taking biotin supplements during pregnancy, so always consult your doctor first, she recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Does biotin increase hair growth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unfortunately, for most people, taking biotin supplements will probably not make much of an impact on hair growth. “Although biotin is widely marketed for hair loss, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is mixed,” Keen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5582478/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;According to a 2017 review&lt;/a&gt;, some studies have shown biotin supplementation had positive outcomes for hair growth in individuals who had an acquired or inherited deficiency in biotin. However, these cases are still relatively uncommon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In healthy individuals who aren’t deficient in biotin, biotin supplementation will likely have no effect on hair growth, the same review concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Does biotin support nail health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546634.2017.1395799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;small clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown biotin supplements may help strengthen brittle nails by improving their firmness, thickness and hardness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, biotin supplements will likely have no strengthening effect on your nails if you aren’t deficient in biotin, said &lt;a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/faculty/m/amy-mcmichael" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Amy McMichael&lt;/a&gt;, MD, FAAD, a board-certified dermatologist and professor of dermatology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you’re facing brittle, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/08/11/why-do-people-bite-their-nails/70429437007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;easily broken nails&lt;/a&gt;, biotin supplements may be used as a short-term treatment, McMichael said. But, if you are considering taking any kind of supplement for nail health, always have a conversation with your board-certified dermatologist first, McMichael underscored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What is the downside of taking biotin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Biotin is a &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/vitamin-h-biotin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;water soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;, meaning “when there's an excess supply, it's excreted through the urine,” said Hemeida. Overall, biotin is considered to be “a very safe vitamin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, “there is too much of a good thing when it comes to biotin, because it can prevent you from accurately diagnosing other important issues,” and it may interfere with the results of certain laboratory tests, Hemeida warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“For that reason, we now recommend to patients to really not take biotin unless they are biotin-deficient, and that is proven by their physician,” McMichael said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article contains affiliate links.

These are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical inactivity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive alcohol consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air pollution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Head injury&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infrequent social contact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypertension&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hearing impairment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, these 12 factors, along with the two new ones, account for 49% of dementia cases across the world. Researchers determined these two new risk factors by looking at recent meta-analyses and studies on the topics; they looked at 14 papers on vision loss and 27 on high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It makes a lot of mechanistic sense,” said &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/arman-fesharaki" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69209634e4b06c13afa4a363" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/arman-fesharaki" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh&lt;/a&gt;, a behavioral neurologist and neuropsychiatrist at Yale Medicine in Connecticut. “A lot of these factors are very much interrelated.” (Fesharaki-Zadeh is not affiliated with the report.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many sources of vision loss, of course, but it tends to be a lot more common in folks who have metabolic risk factors such as high blood pressure, such as poorly controlled diabetes, such as high cholesterol, which is the other risk factor [identified in the report],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, vision is our primary sensory organ — it’s how we process the world around us — and when you can’t see clearly, you’re less likely to spend time doing brain-boosting activities like puzzles, reading or even spending time with other people, said Fesharaki-Zadeh. And these activities are known to help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to high LDL cholesterol (the so-called bad cholesterol), it can lead to the hardening of the blood vessels in the heart and brain, Fesharaki-Zadeh said, adding that high blood pressure and uncontrolled diabetes also affect the blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/atherosclerosis" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="make it more difficult for oxygen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69209634e4b06c13afa4a363" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/atherosclerosis" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;make it more difficult for oxygen&lt;/a&gt; to get to the brain, which over time can lead to neuron damage — “and dementia is essentially an end product of the neurons dying out, so it’s a neurodegenerative process,” Fesharaki-Zadeh explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t tell you how often I see in our patient populations, especially folks above the age of 60, there are certain parts of the brain that are more vulnerable to damage ... and these are the areas that are especially vulnerable to hardening of blood vessels. Someone who has ... high cholesterol, the correlation between that and hardening of blood vessels is quite high, and we see it in our clinical setting very frequently as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The saying that I like to use with patients quite often is what affects your heart will affect your brain, and we see that time and time again,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Olena Ruban via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Olena Ruban via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;If you suffer from vision loss, it's important to manage it for the sake of your future health.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can lower your risk. First, have a good medical team and primary care doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I cannot highlight the importance of a collaborative model between primary care physicians and specialties,” said Fesharaki-Zadeh. Having a primary care doctor who understands your health and is willing to share pertinent information with specialists, like cardiologists and neurologists, will help you stay on top of any issues putting your well-being at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your primary care doctor should also be proactively working to help you control the risk factors — like high cholesterol and high blood pressure — whether that’s through medication, diet or exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fesharaki-Zadeh said you and your doctor should focus on these lifestyle changes as early as possible, at least in midlife, not when you’re at the point when dementia starts to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The front line of medical care are primary care physicians. These are the folks that, by having early discussions ... can go a long distance to prevent the onset of dementia,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also tests that can detect early signs of neurodegeneration and genetic markers of the disease. A primary care doctor can help you learn about these options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Up to 40% of dementias are potentially preventable,” he added, but it’s worth noting that dementia can also be genetic, which makes prevention trickier. But someone who is diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment can benefit from managing these risk factors, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research is also showing that if you have two groups of individuals, someone who has comorbid metabolic diseases such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, versus somebody who doesn’t, and both of these individuals have dementia, the rates of progression of dementia in somebody who doesn’t have metabolic risk factors tend to be slower,” explained Fesharaki-Zadeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to make changes and corrections, he noted, whether you’re a young, seemingly healthy person, in your 80s or 90s, or someone who has already been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brains are highly malleable, Fesharaki-Zadeh said. So if you decide to make healthy lifestyle changes at any point, your brain will respond and be healthier for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPR01raHVvZGdGai1LY0hsaVVuajRRYkN2Sm9lOFNFdW1IanVUWlRwRnVrN3dEaFFWQnNRTE5zRjJxbTVkOVFwQlktX1J6ZlF2MkdseGdYUzh5RjJsTmtWeVYydEliTll4TXA5RFF1R2hIX3cyb2s4WHpGMVVzY2hjU1pmOHJaUFNjVC00cnh0MW5BSWlJYUZBT2dPM2laUdIBowFBVV95cUxPN3BLM1ltSGtRVFJzVG1GZDA2RDFwYkNwdmVYSzlXRXpud1ZGT0l3NVp6ZmlrMEFHcVpydTUxajktU1pta1pYSkxLendmWG9LZlFFZFlUakFic3BnUDdxRVp3XzFBb1g1bjNWMkgwVEplTFZpQTdISlVXMThodmxWYTZORHlJd1d0MnZ5ODNOTXlSQnFFSXVCT1RwQjZHTWl2S3I0</guid></item><item><title>根据顶级营养学家的说法，冬季可以吃5种超级食物来增强免疫力-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-superfoods-to-eat-during-winter-foods-to-boost-immunity-according-to-top-nutritionist/articleshow/125670007.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the season of festivities, flu, and everything in between. As the temperature drops and the holiday season begins, the germs lurking in the dark also grow stronger. Most people may experience sniffles, colds, and that constant feeling of being one step away from falling sick. How do you keep illnesses at bay during this winter? By eating the right foods. In an Instagram video, Suman Agarwal, an Oxford-trained nutritionist and qualified fitness expert, has shared a list of foods that can help to boost immunity and protect you from diseases. “These are the foods that strengthen your immunity, keep your energy stable, and protect you from common winter infections, so make sure they’re on your plate every single day,” she said. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mustard greens&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eat your greens, especially mustard greens. These tiny greens are at the top of Agarwal’s winter food list. “They are rich in antioxidants like A, C, and K. Very good for immunity and heart health because they are naturally high in fibre, support digestion, and prevent constipation,” she said. Mustard greens belong to the Brassicaceae family. A recent study by researchers at Nanjing Agricultural University found that Brassica vegetables, including broccoli, kale, cabbage, and mustard greens, contain numerous phytonutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study, published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Horticulture Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, found that the glucosinolates, vitamins, carotenoids, phenolics, and essential minerals can &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hr/article/12/2/uhae302/7849786" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;reduce the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Foods that boost immunity before winter sets in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gond (edible gum)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second on the nutritionist’s list is Gond, or edible gum. A personal favourite winter food, Agarwal swears by gond ladoos. This edible gum is a natural resin obtained from the sap of acacia trees. “It helps you to maintain your body heat and provides energy. The presence of magnesium and zinc improves your immune system. Rich in calcium, it supports your bone health, and the presence of zinc and magnesium makes your immune system robust,” she said. The nutritionist also added that the gum acts as a galactagogue and naturally improves milk production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indian gooseberries&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indian gooseberry, or amla, is known for its numerous health benefits. An excellent source of vitamin C, this fruit also has potential antioxidant and heart-health benefits. A 2015 study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that gooseberry has potential &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2015/950890" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;anticancer properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. “It is very rich in vitamin C. But did you know that vitamin C in all fruits and vegetables starts getting oxidised after you cut it? But in amla, oxidation of vitamin C is very slow,” the nutritionist said. Consuming this fruit during winter boosts immunity and also improves hair and skin health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sesame&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another kitchen staple, sesame, used in both sweet and savoury dishes, is a superfood. “Sesame seeds are thermogenic, meaning they naturally generate heat in your body. They have the highest calcium content among all seeds — 975 mg in just 100 grams,” she said. A 2012 American Heart Association meeting report also found that sesame oil is linked to a significant &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/sesame-and-rice-bran-oil-lowers-238424" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;drop in blood pressure and improved cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fresh turmeric&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the nutritionist, turmeric, a popular spice used in Asian cuisines, is also a winter superfood. She noted that this yellow-coloured spice “is rich in antioxidants, has anti-inflammatory properties, and boosts your immunity.” A 2023 review of several studies has shown that turmeric contains several bioactive compounds that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142523000088" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;improve gut health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and the immune system. Agarwal revealed that she likes to add turmeric to her tea. “My winter tea is made from grated ginger and turmeric, maybe half and half a teaspoon, and by adding a little bit of honey and lime to it. This winter tea reduces gas and bloating, and is one of the best anti-inflammatory drinks you can have in the winter,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

There are quite a few side effects &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292133/10-dangerous-side-effects-of-not-drinking-enough-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;if you don’t drink enough every day&lt;/a&gt;. Not only can you experience brain fog, low energy, mood swings and weakness, but it can also lead to headaches, weight gain, an increased risk of stroke, a slower metabolism, overeating and skin damage. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-water-you-should-drink-daily-11739359" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;optimal hydration&lt;/a&gt; can vary from person to person, we generally recommend that women drink 11.5 cups of water per day, while men should aim for 15.5 cups. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The only issue? Water doesn’t always taste good, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072180/why-does-some-water-taste-better-than-others/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nor does it taste the same&lt;/a&gt; everywhere.

The easiest solution is to invest in a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R6211QP?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;water filter pitcher&lt;/a&gt;, and we found what might be the perfect one.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The LifeStraw is a sleek, double-filtered water pitcher that claims to remove all unwanted impurities from your water. It’s made from glass, meaning your risk of adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/scientist-recommended-plastic-kitchen-tools-to-replace-amazon-11720768" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;additional microplastics&lt;/a&gt; from the container itself is mitigated. It does have a plastic BPA-free filter system, although it’s challenging to find a water filter pitcher without one, unfortunately. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, how does it work, exactly? The top section of the white insert includes a tall, slim membrane filter that removes microplastics, and potentially bacteria, according to the brand. Once the water passes through this filter, it makes its way through a carbon and ion exchange filter that can eliminate chemicals like PFAs (aka forever chemicals), lead, mercury and other heavy metals. LifeStraw claims that between the two filters, you’ll be weeding out over 30 contaminants while still maintaining the presence of minerals like magnesium and potassium. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The membrane filter needs replacing once a year, and the carbon and ion filter every two months. Thankfully, the initial purchase of the pitcher includes filters, plus the brand sells a year's worth of filters in a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LifeStraw-Complete-Replacement-Membrane-Microfilter/dp/B092DN3W2B?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;convenient kit&lt;/a&gt; for repurchase. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This particular bottle holds up to 7 cups of water. It has a nifty spout on top and a flip-top lid to refill it easily. And, to make sure it doesn’t move around, the base is fitted with a removable silicone sleeve. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, instead of burning calories, brown fat could help &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2216435119" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;to improve metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; – the body’s ability to process and use energy from food effectively. People who have poor metabolic health are unable to clear glucose from their blood quickly, raising their risk of type 2 diabetes. Brown fat could act simply by taking up glucose from the bloodstream, or by secreting hormones that act on other tissues to regulate insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"In terms of whole-body energy expenditure, it [brown fat] probably does not play as large of a role in humans as it does in mice," says Cohen. "So my personal feeling, based on the data, is that brown fat activation is not going to be a good means to treat obesity or to lose significant amounts of weight." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"However, the data is much stronger to suggest that activating brown fat might lower glucose levels and improve metabolic health. So, I think if there is going to be a therapeutic side to this, it's much more likely going to be in treating the complications of obesity and ageing than in treating obesity per se."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 faEbjU"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 ejktow"&gt;The shock of cold-water immersion causes the body to think it's in danger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But how can we activate brown fat, and harness the superpowers it may – or may not – contain? One way is to expose yourself to cold, as uncomfortable as it may be. Think ice baths, cold water swimming, or cryotherapy chambers – a specialised device that exposes the body to extremely low temperatures for one to three minutes to promote healing and wellness. The shock of cold-water immersion causes the body to think it's in danger, activating the fight-or-flight response. This releases the neurotransmitter noradrenalin, which binds to and "activates" brown fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOajZuN2h4MjBvaUFJZ25lNmNKU2steGpQS2M0Qk50OGZaVEdta0duTEJwWWJ1a056X2FFbGZ1My1MMURHNVN1UWtSQnAzWGYtNzM0bWdYR3R3QUk3M0ZlTlRwSUVaRkVwUUN6aXF4ZDljSV9vQk9Ta1NZRkl5akFKVXlrMHVLUDJoQTNzSlBQanluRGlKWC1SbUs5NUs2c3FYbHpVVTYyS0MtS2dlUTdmYW5NRTVDQQ</guid></item><item><title>学校的疫苗接种率引起了家长、医疗专业人员的关注- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/vaccination-rates-in-schools-cause-concern-for-parents-medical-professionals/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyContent"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas James relies on others to be vaccinated because, for now, he can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;A leukemia patient and stem cell transplant recipient, Lucas, 16, of Hempfield receives intravenous antibody treatments to help him rebuild his immune system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;“(Doctors) said he may never be able to be vaccinated again if his body doesn’t stop needing these transfusions,” said his mother, Megan James.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;Lucas is among the growing number of school-age children who, for one reason or another, are not being vaccinated against preventable diseases. Some, like Lucas, may be unvaccinated for medical reasons. Others might be because of religious beliefs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;The trend is causing concern among medical professionals — and affecting the population’s herd immunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pennsylvania, students in kindergarten are required to have four doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; four doses of the polio vaccine; two doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); three doses of hepatitis B; and two doses of the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students also can provide evidence of immunity, such as proof they’ve already had and recovered from a disease such as chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the vaccinations, students must apply for an exemption. Increasingly, more parents or guardians are doing just that. Students in Pennsylvania also can be declared exempt from vaccines for religious or philosophical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 1,800 students in Allegheny County submitted medical, religious or philosophical vaccination exemptions in 2024, compared with about 1,300 in 2020, a 38% increase, according to figures from the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westmoreland County saw an even bigger jump — about 130% — with 926 students filing for exemptions in 2024, compared with just under 400 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reasons a child is unable to be vaccinated, including that they have weakened immune systems, are on chemotherapy or had an allergic reaction to a vaccine, said Dr. Joseph Aracri, system chair of pediatrics with Allegheny Health Network Pediatric Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone like Lucas relies on herd immunity to remain illness-free. Herd immunity is when a disease has little chance of spreading within a population because people are resistant to it, either from having the disease and recovering or, more commonly, because they have been vaccinated against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a nonissue for many diseases, herd immunity is coming back into question for some diseases, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data shows school-age children in several Western Pennsylvania counties below herd immunity levels for some diseases, including measles, mumps and rubella. Allegheny, Westmoreland, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana and Beaver counties report vaccination rates for kindergarten-age children for the MMR vaccine are below the 95% threshold for herd immunity, according to 2024 data from the &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/programs/immunizations/rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can be concerning for someone like Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’d be very vulnerable if he were exposed to someone with a virus,” his mother said. “It would be very likely that he would catch something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things like the measles are really scary for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sophomore at Hempfield Area Senior High School, Lucas was diagnosed with leukemia in January 2022. After two years of treatments, doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission, but it returned in January 2024, just days after he had finished a course of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, Lucas underwent a blood-making bone marrow stem cell transplant. The procedure left his immune system vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lucas attends school in-person, he wears a mask to protect himself. Megan James said that if Hempfield’s vaccination rates drop, Lucas would need to be pulled out of school again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating,” James said. “He’s been through enough. We shouldn’t have to isolate him because of misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither federal nor state health agencies track how many students are fully up to schedule for all vaccines; they instead track the student population by individual vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas’ doctors are keeping an eye on outbreaks and will notify her if it becomes dangerous, James said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things that most kids can fight off, his body wouldn’t be able to fight back,” she said. “It’s scary times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Growing hesitancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy has become a growing trend thanks, in part, to the covid-19 pandemic and skepticism surrounding the covid vaccine, Aracri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can easily fall victim to misinformation about vaccines on social media, said Barbara Nightingale, deputy director for clinical services with the Allegheny County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not surprised by the decline (in vaccination rates), since vaccine hesitancy has been growing across the U.S. and globally for the past decade,” Nightingale said. “Because vaccine misinformation feeds off fear, it can spread easily, particularly as more residents receive health information from social media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recommends residents speak with their health care provider if they have any concerns about the effects or safety of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aracri said this is the second time in his career he has seen a trending decrease in vaccination rates. The first time was in the late 1990s when a paper by an English anti-vaccine activist and former surgeon falsely claimed a link between the MMR vaccine and bowel disease and autism, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Aracri is seeing what he calls hesitancy from parents rather than resistance in regard to vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that this time around what we’re seeing is just more questions and more of an understanding,” Aracri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covid pandemic was a major culprit and particularly damaging from a vaccine acceptance standpoint, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(People were) being forced to get a covid shot, and the covid shot was supposed to bring an end to the pandemic,” Aracri said. “And we found out that, while it really didn’t — it protected those of our most vulnerable — but it didn’t necessarily prevent the spread or end the covid pandemic anytime sooner. So whenever you give a child a shot and they still end up getting covid, that makes you doubt the other things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, combined with political unrest, has created uncertainty, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have access to all kinds of unedited information that’s out there,” Aracri said. “Our job is to be able to, first, be aware of all misinformation, disinformation or whatever you want to call it, and be able to have that conversation and discuss with the patient the benefits of being vaccinated as opposed to the risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem: No vaccine is 100% effective for 100% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different vaccines have different levels of effectiveness, Aracri said. The MMR vaccine is about 98% effective, he said, while other vaccines such as the flu shot — a seasonal vaccine — can be anywhere from 40% to 75% effective each year because the flu virus constantly mutates. He emphasized the importance for providers to counsel patients and parents when they have questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;In-school concerns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darcy Lutz has been a nurse at Shaler Area High School for the past six years. She said her job involves two main responsibilities regarding student vaccinations: making sure the school, parents and students are in compliance with Pennsylvania school health laws and providing accurate information about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutz called the dropping vaccination rates concerning. Although, she said, the district’s percentages haven’t dropped from last school year, education about vaccines is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not here to fight with people about their strongly held beliefs,” Lutz said. “If people have questions, we’re always here to talk and educate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaler Area has a 97% MMR vaccination rate, but because the disease is so contagious, an outbreak could occur if that were to fall as little as 2%, Lutz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most vulnerable populations really rely on herd immunity,” she said. “When we see those rates dip, it really is dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her nine years as a school nurse, Lutz said, she has encountered various reasons children go unvaccinated. The biggest factor is access to health care, she said. Some families have no insurance or don’t have reliable transportation to get to a doctor. There’s also a rising immigrant and refugee population in the district, and some of those families are still working to catch up with the required vaccine schedule, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district has brought Allegheny County’s mobile health clinic to its schools to give families direct access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also cited two other reasons for parents deciding not to vaccinate their children: misinformation and feeling as though their freedoms are being threatened when they’re told it’s required by law to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Disease resurgence &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aracri pointed to a recent outbreak of the measles in Texas as an example of how a disease can reemerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said a large population was unvaccinated, falling below herd immunity levels, and it caused an outbreak. It grew to be the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. in more than 30 years, with about 760 confirmed cases in Texas by August. The outbreak resulted in 99 hospitalizations and the deaths of two unvaccinated school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nightingale said residents should know that many people are vaccinated against diseases that once were common and caused serious illness or death. For example, the polio vaccine, developed by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh and widely distributed during the 1950s, has brought down cases of polio worldwide by more than 99%, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All vaccines play an important role in saving lives, reducing disease and creating a healthy community,” Nightingale said. “This role is increasingly important when school-age children are involved, as their immune system is not completely developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nightingale said that if rates continue to drop, communities are at a higher risk of a resurgence of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is especially important for residents to remember that, like any medical intervention, vaccines carry some risks,” she said, “but for most people the risk of the disease is far greater.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;div class="subscriber-preview"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan Erickson was a thriving young college graduate with a bright future, having studied clarinet and music composition at the University of Memphis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-preview"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Dubuque native and Hempstead High School alum, the accomplished 22-year-old already had realized his instrumental music being performed by ensembles throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had just finished his engagement as a community coordinator for a summer music festival in August 2024 when suddenly Erickson came down with what he described as a panic attack, followed by a severe and prolonged migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It came out of nowhere,” he said. “Nothing like that had ever happened to me before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, the illness seemingly progressed, with Erickson suffering debilitating migraines almost daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, Erickson came down with what he described as “the worst flu” he had ever experienced, resulting in a series of doctor’s appointments, X-rays and seven courses of antibiotics that treated symptoms but never got to the root of the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erickson was hospitalized in October 2024, with his liver and spleen in serious decline. He was diagnosed with mononucleosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, more than one year later, Erickson said he has never recovered from the feeling he was experiencing upon entering the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having returned to Dubuque to be cared for by his mother, Erickson began traveling to Iowa City for further testing and to receive treatment at University of Iowa Health Care, where mounting evidence pointed him toward the possibility of a rare and complex neuro-immune disease known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Erickson finally can name what has been ailing him, the diagnosis yields more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no direct pinpoint to say what caused it,” Erickson said. “There is no cure. From day to day, I can never know how I’ll be feeling, what will trigger the next spiral or how long it will take me to recover from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘A nightmare’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1% of mononucleosis cases have been known to trigger ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The various symptoms are problematic, as they can mirror the common cold and flu, including muscle and joint pain, problems with standing, headaches, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, digestive issues and increased sensitivity to food and chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of the disease is post-exertional malaise, in which physical or mental activity can cause a significant worsening of symptoms, as well as severe fatigue, cognitive difficulties and trouble sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms also can come and go, with limited predictability of their severity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anxiety of it is such a scary thing from the possibility of the symptoms that can occur, even from sitting, standing or trying to go for a short walk,” Erickson said. “It feels like I’m at death’s door. There are some days I’m stuck in my room or can’t leave my bed. I don’t interact with people very much. I’m only able to watch videos or play games because I never know what’s going to trigger it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no known causes or cures. And treatment usually equates to catering to symptoms that most impact an individual’s ability to perform normal daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been a terrible discovery to realize that the disease I am dealing with, there are very little answers for,” Erickson said. “The whole process has been ruling out every other possible thing that could be causing it. It has taken me from literally graduating as one of the top students in my class, earning awards in outstanding achievement and with a promising career in music ahead of me — all that work to being struck with so much pain I can barely move some days. It has been a nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still bedridden most days, Erickson was able to tap into his creativity, recording a timelapse video, “Spend a Week with M.E.,” a weeklong documentation of his experience with the disease to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video captures Erickson alone in his room — sometimes sleeping, sometimes reading, sometimes scrolling on a digital tablet or playing a game. It shows the true crux of the disease: the isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spend a lot of time by myself,” Erickson said. “Sometimes, I’ll feel well enough to have a visit from a friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a year of being too ill to write music or tolerate sounds in the same way, Erickson recently mustered enough energy to put together an album, titled “A Gesture Makes a World,” to accompany the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both projects led him to launch Gifts for M.E., a nonprofit to provide items to ME/CFS patients and their caregivers throughout the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because symptoms also can include dizziness and increased sensitivity to light and sound, items include black-out sleep masks, noise-canceling headphones, shower chairs, heart-rate monitors, low-light and low-stimulation gaming consoles and grocery delivery subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been a very calm and very simple thing I can do that enables me to feel as though I am still productive in some way in the world,” Erickson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A misunderstood disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite an estimated 3.3 million people suffering from it in the U.S., according to the CDC, ME/CFS remains a highly misunderstood disease. More than nine out of 10 individuals with it have yet to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One reason it’s difficult to diagnose is because there is no targeted test for ME/CFS, as it has the ability to affect all parts of the body,” said Ruby Tam, of ME/CFS Clinic Minnesota. “Another reason is that some individuals suffering from the disease have limited access to health care or resources to connect them to health care providers who know enough about ME/CFS to be able to treat it or understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tam, who also treats Erickson, is a family medicine doctor who practiced at Northwest Family Clinics in Minnesota from 2012 to 2022. She encountered her first ME/CFS patient in 2015. After retiring from family practice in 2023, Tam launched ME/CFS Clinic Minnesota, volunteering her time to study and treat individuals with ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erickson’s charity is partnered with the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people who come and see me have exhausted their resources and don’t know who else to talk to,” Tam said. “They don’t know what they’re dealing with, but they know how they’re feeling, and they want answers as to what they’re dealing with. In many cases of ME/CFS, unfortunately, what we’re finding is many patients aren’t being believed by practitioners. But there also has been limited research and no path to learning more about this disease. So, there are limitations in treating only the symptoms, rather than understanding the underlying cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS Clinic Minnesota advocates for patients and works with providers to promote additional research, “providing resources toward knowing how to work with this disease and how to treat symptoms to make them more manageable for patients,” Tam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In working with patients, Tam said she has seen some go into periods of remission, where — with ongoing care and not overly exerting themselves — they can experience reasonable sleep and a normalized way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That, of course, is the main goal — allowing people to have some chance at a normal life,” Tam said. “It’s different for everyone dealing with the illness. For Evan, we’re still working. But he’s a remarkable person, and the work he is doing to raise funds and bring more eyes and awareness to the disease is encouraging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tam’s work for the cause also has provided a spark of optimism for Erickson, who described most days now as witnessing “a slow melting away” of his life prior to the disease and everything he had been working toward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, it’s not even taking it day by day, but hour by hour, and realizing that I might not ever get back to my old life, but be building something new,” he said. “Still, there is some hope and fulfillment that has come from knowing I’m trying to do something in my experience with ME/CFS to help others as well, and to educate people that this is real.

It’s something I’ve done since I could walk and people were mindfully spending time among trees for centuries before we coined the term “forest bathing” in the eighties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple medical experts on my &lt;a href="/topic/well-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well Enough&lt;/em&gt; podcast &lt;/a&gt;have told me that a walk in nature, a hand on a tree trunk or time spent thinking about trees can improve mood. And the NHS is now directly recommending time in nature, with new “green social prescribing” initiatives urging those with poor mental health to spend more time outdoors (something they have been doing in &lt;a href="/travel/europe/sweden/sweden-prescribed-digital-detox-b2862011.html" title="Doctors are now ‘prescribing’ Sweden – this is what happened when I ditched my phone for the Scandi wilderness"&gt;Sweden &lt;/a&gt;for a while). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, recent data from a &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs13280-025-02275-w&amp;amp;articleId=b2857783&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;global study&lt;/a&gt; shows that the UK is one of the places where people feel the least connected to nature. So to mark National Tree Week, I spoke with experts to learn more about the benefits of forest bathing and why a mindful walk in the woods can make all the difference to your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is forest bathing?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shinrin-yoku” translates as “bathing in the forest atmosphere”, or “taking in the forest through our senses”. It was conceived of as an intentional practice as a response to high stress levels in Japanese city workers by government minister Tomohide Akiyama in the eighties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-step-count-heart-health-b2854590.html" title="The big mistake people make when walking 10,000 steps per day"&gt; walking part is obviously good for you. &lt;/a&gt;But forest bathing is considered more of a workout for the mind than the body. The key part is simply being in nature, connecting with it through all of our senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, dropping out of the mind and into the body. It sounds simple but this is something we rarely do, surrounded as we are by the distractions of modern life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are often told that distress is ‘all in the mind’, says clinical psychologist &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.operationcentaur.com/team"&gt;Puffin O’Hanlon. &lt;/a&gt;“Actually, distress lives in our bodies, and in our relationships. And more specifically, distress radiates from points of disconnection – from the natural world, from each other, and between parts of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In much of the Western world we have come to separate body from mind and to privilege mind,” says O’Hanlon, who recently led me on a forest bathing tour through Richmond Park, where she runs Project Centaur – an organisation offering nature and equine therapy. “We are taught to experience and navigate the world through language, and the problem-solving, impulse-controlling functions of the prefrontal cortex – our so-called rational brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the more we rely on the human rational brain to lead the way, the more difficult it becomes to direct attention or energy to the myriad other ways of being, problem solving and communicating.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/essentialism-changed-my-life-b2731188.html" title="Essentialism: how the disciplined pursuit of less changed my life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essentialism: how the disciplined pursuit of less changed my life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, some of us need help to do this, which is why all manner of wellness studios, hotels and organisations now offer to guide visitors through forest bathing and mindful hiking experiences, showing us how to focus on the senses and connect with the natural world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a stay at Mallorca’s clifftop &lt;a href="/travel/hotels/jumeirah-mallorca-hotel-and-spa-review-b2816041.html" title="Jumeirah Mallorca, hotel review"&gt;Jumeirah hotel&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to book a brilliant guided mindfulness hike up into the mountains. I’ve been lucky to forest bathe in Japan too, in the forests surrounding Kinosaki and Kyoto, where I traversed glades, climbed mossy staircases and paused at temples to reflect. And I’ve also experienced many forest bathing in programmes closer to home, in the New Forest, Hertfordshire and Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But obviously, you don’t need to be led by anyone or pay a fee to walk mindfully and focus on your senses. A guide might help, but for the most part, this practice is about embracing simplicity, stillness and awareness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cztisH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/25/17/50/iStock-2226638823.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/25/17/50/iStock-2226638823.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/25/17/50/iStock-2226638823.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Forest bathing has been shown to reduce stress hormones and blood pressure" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-90421"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Forest bathing has been shown to reduce stress hormones and blood pressure&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Science-backed benefits of being in nature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you still need convincing, there are various studies that show that forest bathing makes us feel better. Olga Terebenina and Gary Evans, the founders of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://tfb.institute/"&gt;The Forest Bathing Institute&lt;/a&gt; and authors of &lt;em&gt;The Healing Power of Trees&lt;/em&gt;, write in the book’s preface: “Groundbreaking research has shown that forests are able to boost our immune system and even affect our physiology after only a couple of hours spent mindfully among the trees.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9665958/"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; study indicated that forest bathing has the power to reduce blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s author, Qing Li, says, “My research team has established a new medical science called Forest Medicine; a new interdisciplinary science that studies the effects of forest environments on human health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the profile of mood states (POMS) test, shinrin-yoku reduces the scores for anxiety, depression, anger, fatigue and confusion, and increases the score for vigour, showing preventive effects on depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more recent &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1454992/full"&gt;2025 study &lt;/a&gt;corroborated these findings, showing that “forest bathing interventions might improve mental and physical health, reduce blood pressure, improve sleep quality and boost immunity, as well as alleviate depression, anxiety, and stress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gemma-ogston-functional-mushrooms-b2836844.html" title="Chef and entrepreneur Gemma Ogston on shrooms, social media and why adaptogens aren’t a trend"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chef and entrepreneur Gemma Ogston on shrooms, social media and why adaptogens aren’t a trend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Hanlon explains that our brains and bodies are naturally in tune with the scents, shapes and vibrations of green spaces, which is why spending more time in nature can help improve wellbeing. “We are wired for this stuff. We are highly sensitive to the smell of petrichor – the compounds released by bacteria in the soil when it rains after a dry spell. We are fluent in fractals – the repeating patterns of nature found in petals and waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But without attention, there is limited awareness, and as awareness decreases, so does connection. It is really rather difficult for many of us to feel connected to nature, to each other, or to what is happening in and around us in the present moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth has a natural frequency, known as the Schumann resonance, which is a set of electromagnetic waves around the planet, with the fundamental frequency being approximately 7.83Hz. This fundamental frequency is often called the “earth's heartbeat”, and there are ongoing scientific studies into its effects on human behaviour and wellbeing. What forest bathing seeks to achieve is a quieting of outside noise and an opportunity to tap back into this frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies show that our brain activity seems to align with Earth’s natural electromagnetic rhythms. This could explain why changes in these fields can affect our mood, sleep or concentration and why spending time in nature away from cities, noise, technology and other distractions can allow us to reconnect with natural rhythms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another benefit to interacting with nature, which is that it encourages our desire to protect it. By reminding ourselves of the importance of green spaces and natural ecosystems, we seek to preserve them and integrate into them, where previously we had separated ourselves. And that can only be a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/mens-mental-health-depression-loneliness-owen-o-kane-b2859419.html" title="Men are still faking it until they break: Inside the crisis of hidden depression"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men are still faking it until they break: Inside the crisis of hidden depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNOHJIRndSb01CNlJoLUZHV1h2MFNvazFlV1B4Wnp6UnhpV0I4YXNnc0JIUHhoX0p1VnZUX25GOTV6VnpFaXN2Z0NjZ01EY09nOVoySVE1TnF5NHNuWkVHejBTN0NkblBRbGxPOFM2QktrR3RmZ2ZWXzlIeXlCeVlub3l3cTJzUmhpT05TOXJ5RkVmbDhpZFplTjlLaEdQZXJIQmRQQWgxU3lVbjZN</guid></item><item><title>​外科医生揭示30分钟步行如何改变心脏健康-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cardiac-surgeon-reveals-how-30-minutes-of-walking-can-transform-heart-health/articleshow/125668505.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart diseases are on the rise. In fact, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1 out of every 5 deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the United States is due to heart disease, according to the CDC. While there are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, what many tend to ignore is the remarkable power of physical activity in improving heart health. According to experts, the best prescription for good heart health is not pills but physical activity. In an Instagram video, Dr Dmitry Yaranov, a leading heart transplant cardiologist from Memphis, trained at Samara State Medical University, explained the impact of walking on heart health. “I prescribe this more often than pills: just 30–60 minutes of walking a day can literally transform your heart, your mind, and your life,” the doctor, with nearly two decades of clinical experience, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of walking in heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What makes walking a great form of exercise is not just its simplicity but the cascade of physiological changes that happen the moment you start moving. “I’ve seen patients go from exhausted to energised, anxious to peaceful — not because of a new drug, but because they started to move,” Dr Yaranov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Winter Heart Care: Doctor-Approved Top Tips For A Healthy Heart This Season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent study by the American Heart Association found that getting more daily steps and engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were both associated with a significantly &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/walking-moving-more-may-lower-risk-of-cardiovascular-death-for-women-with-cancer-history?preview=aaa9&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another study, published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, found that a brisk walking pace, and the amount of time spent at this speed, may &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/111/16/763" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;lower the risk of heart rhythm abnormalities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; such as atrial fibrillation, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), and bradycardia (very slow heartbeat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How 30 to 60 minutes of walking can improve heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr Yaranov stated that walking is the most underrated therapy he knows for your body, brain, and soul. The surgeon further explained how every step leads you to a better heart and improved overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to him, when you walk for a minute, blood flow surges. By five minutes, something remarkable happens in your brain: your mood begins to lift and anxiety starts to ease. When you reach the 10-minute mark, cortisol, your body's primary stress hormone, starts to drop. This brings a sense of calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; With every minute, the benefits compound. After 15 minutes of walking, blood sugar levels start to stabilise, the doctor said. By 30 minutes, your body switches into fat-burning mode. Those on a weight-loss journey or wanting to maintain a healthy weight may benefit from just half an hour of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond the physical benefits, walking also offers mental wellness. The doctor revealed that mental fog begins to fade 45 minutes into walking. Overthinking starts to die down. You will no longer feel those hundred &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;what ifs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; popping in your head. And as you complete an hour of walking, your dopamine levels go up and you experience happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent study by researchers at the University of Texas at Arlington, published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Psychology of Sport and Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, found that swapping 30 minutes of sitting for light activity such as walking can &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029225001967?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;boost energy and mood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Movement will even make you feel happier the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember, you don’t need fancy gym memberships or expensive supplements to improve your heart health. Walking can do just the right job. “Just you, your heart, and a few consistent steps. Start small. Stay consistent. Your heart will remember every step,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikx2l81009a2cp74hfz6hf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A senior Food and Drug Administration official on Friday said the agency will change its vaccine approval process, alleging that Covid-19 vaccination resulted in the deaths of 10 children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikx2n2200003b6noldw3bmg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an internal memo obtained by CNN, Dr. Vinay Prasad — the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer and the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research — claimed, “Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikxo0j4000g3b6nutfjg8xc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prasad did not provide details about the deaths or how the FDA came to that conclusion, but pointed to “an initial analysis” that examined 96 deaths and linked 10 to the Covid-19 vaccination. He also claimed that Covid-19 “was never highly lethal for children” and that the effects of it “are comparable” to respiratory viruses for which there aren’t annual vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiky5zie000q3b6n97g5x3qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have no doubt that many vaccines have saved millions of lives globally, and many have benefits that far exceed risks, but vaccines are like any other medical product,” Prasad said. “The right drug given to the right patient at the right time is great, but the same drug can be inappropriately given, causing harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikynt8500173b6ngyun33t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prasad said as a result of the FDA analysis, the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines that will require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed. Among the changes would be stricter requirements for authorization of vaccines used for pregnant women and trials for pneumonia vaccines that will need to prove the shots reduce disease, instead of showing that the vaccine produces enough antibodies to fight the illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmil6rl9o00073b6n0kw2yyh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency will also “revise the annual flu vaccine framework,” Prasad said, and “will re-appraise safety and be honest in vaccine labels.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmil6rl9o00083b6nvor6u3gc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although Prasad’s memo didn’t provide details about how the process would change, it could require larger studies that take longer to complete, slowing the process significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmil6rl9o000a3b6na54yg9ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the memo, Prasad said he’s open to discussion about the changes but said such debates should be internal to the FDA. “Some staff may not agree with these core principles and operating principles,” he wrote before urging those staffers to submit their resignation letters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            CNN has reached out to the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the agency, for comment.

            Friday’s memo is in line with arguments long made by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines and previously founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As the HHS secretary, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/05/health/hhs-slashes-funding-for-mrna-vaccine-development"&gt;slashed funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine development, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;removed all members&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-guidance"&gt;directed the CDC&lt;/a&gt; to change its website to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines"&gt;include false claims&lt;/a&gt; that link autism and vaccines.

            The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, handpicked by Kennedy, is set to meet next week to discuss the childhood vaccine schedule and the timing of the hepatitis B vaccine, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; of the meeting.

            For more than 30 years, the first in the series of hepatitis B shots has been recommended for infants shortly after birth — a strategy that nearly eradicated the potentially fatal disease among children in the US. Although there is no new evidence about the vaccine’s safety or effectiveness, the new advisory panel has been considering whether to delay the first shots by months or years.

A 30-gram daily dose provides 10 grams of fibre, along with significant quantities of omega-3 fatty acids, protein, calcium, and powerful antioxidants, she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Chia seeds have 50% more fibre than sabja seeds'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video she posted, Dr Reddy said: “The number one complete&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/harvard-gastroenterologist-shares-10-tasty-high-fiber-foods-that-are-not-salads-101764057078268.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="high-fibre food"&gt; high-fibre food&lt;/a&gt; in the world is not oats or leafy vegetables. It's something that has 10 times more fibre than your daily bowl of oats. But fibre is just the beginning. This food also gives you omega-3 for your heart, protein for your muscles, calcium for your bones and also keeps you full for hours. What is this superfood? Chia seeds. Not sabja seeds or basil seeds. It's chia seeds. Yes, sabja seeds are good for cooling your body in summer. But chia seeds have 50 percent more fibre, double the omega-3 and protein, making them nutritionally superior for everyday health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;She added that these seeds effectively address chronic constipation; when soaked in water, they absorb ten times their weight to form a cleansing gel that acts as a natural 'broom' for the intestines.&lt;/span&gt; Dr Reddy said, “They're a complete package. 30 grams of chia seeds will give you 10 grams of fibre, more than what most of us can eat in an entire day. Plus omega-3 fatty acids, 5 grams of protein and powerful antioxidants. And here's the biggest benefit. It solves chronic constipation. 7 out of 10 Indians struggle with chronic constipation because our diet is poor in fibre, and we don't drink enough water. When you soak chia seeds, they absorb 10 times their weight in water and form a gel. This slimy gel acts like a natural broom. It cleans your intestines.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to have chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Reddy recommended consuming the resulting gel and water as the final meal of the day to ensure satiety until the next morning, eliminating late-night cravings.&lt;/span&gt; According to her, this habit can transform your gut health, eliminating the need to spend money on expensive supplements like&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-suggests-top-probiotic-prebiotic-and-fibre-rich-foods-and-drinks-for-happy-gut-health-101748585913446.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="probiotics"&gt; probiotics&lt;/a&gt; or digestive enzymes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Reddy said, “Here's how I use chia seeds. I take 30 grams of chia seeds, soak them in water for at least four hours. I usually soak them in the afternoon. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Then, at 7pm, as my last meal of the day, I drink this gel water directly, or I add it to high-protein lactose-free milk.&lt;/span&gt; Why at night? It keeps me full until the next morning. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;With this, your late-night cravings will vanish, your gut health will transform, and you won't need to waste thousands on probiotic supplements, digestive enzymes, fibre powders or fancy gut-healthy products.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"One of my prior patients is a roofer who lived a very full life of alcohol, women, and drugs. He was infected with HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and was cirrhotic, and didn't really care about his health at all. He was thin, weighing 110 pounds on a six-foot frame, which included 20 pounds of ascites in his abdomen. He was angry and didn't listen to anyone, refusing therapy most of the time. I met him first in the ICU, where he had AIDS, end-stage liver disease, hepatorenal syndrome, unexplained lymph nodes all over his body, variceal hemorrhage, Kaposi sarcoma, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The prognosis of in-hospital death was &amp;gt;90% even with therapy."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"I was involved in his care for about two weeks, and again, he refused every therapy that his primary physicians suggested. I was surprised he lasted the two weeks. Finally, he was so fed up with the noisiness in the ICU that he requested transfer to palliative care, and was eventually sent to a hospice for patients with advanced HIV to live out his remaining few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year later, I got a call from the hospice requesting a follow-up appointment for him. I was shocked that he was still alive and asked if I could talk to him. He was all better. Turns out he had the hots for his nurse in the hospice and did everything she asked in order to please her, including taking his medications for the first time. She had slowly nursed him back to health, convinced him to restart HIV meds, put him on a low salt diet for his liver disease, and then eventually got him up and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spent another six months in a rehabilitation facility, then went back to work. He saw me in follow-up for a while as we treated his Hepatitis C, then his cirrhosis shockingly improved. After a couple of years, he moved to another place to start a construction company and became quite successful financially; he remains abstinent from his former vices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's the only person whom I've seen come back from death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/akhsyc/comment/ef5ca7o/" target="_blank"&gt;u/Ralph_Malfredsson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Parents of that era—our grandparents and parents—were doing the very best they could with the information and cultural norms available to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, today’s neuroscience, child psychology, and developmental research reveal that some once-normal, widely accepted parenting practices inadvertently caused stress, suppressed crucial emotional development, or exposed kids to unnecessary safety and health risks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article explores a dozen once-standard practices and uses modern research to explain why they were tough on a child’s developing brain, emotional health, and long-term well-being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image Credit: PeopleImages/iStock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice 1: “Children Should Be Seen and Not Heard” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This adage normalized emotional suppression and the idea that children’s thoughts and feelings were secondary to adult convenience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern Understanding: We now know that the ability to articulate and process emotions (emotional regulation) is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9791326/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:key function of the prefrontal cortex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;key function of the prefrontal cortex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is still developing in children. When children’s distress, sadness, or anger is consistently brushed off or punished, it hinders the development of these neural pathways. Listening to a child’s feelings—even when you can’t solve their problem—validates their experience, lowers their stress response, and is crucial for cognitive and social growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image Credit: MAXSHOT/iStock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice 2: No-Seatbelt, Free-Range Car Riding &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was completely normal to see kids standing on the transmission hump, jumping in the back, or lying unrestrained in the rear window of station wagons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impact: In an accident, an unrestrained child becomes a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6905510/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:projectile;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;projectile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

They deserve our compassion and respect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we celebrate how far our understanding of child development has come. By applying neuroscience, we have healthier parenting tools that lead to more emotionally secure and resilient brains. We can offer our children the best of both worlds: the modern safety of science, combined with a healthy dose of that nostalgic freedom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like MediaFeed’s content? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/channel/source/Mediafeed/sr-vid-ckv6hf6hjif65e0cjnm83s7yb2y0w5xmun0j4refire0ev6727is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Be sure to follow us;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be sure to follow us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article was produced and syndicated by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mediafeed.us/blog-posts/8-beautiful-marketing-disasters-of-dunder-mifflin-paper-co" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MediaFeed.us;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;MediaFeed.us&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 02:31:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE95UkNSVk5vNGhOV2VJa2V6S0hZOHZQUmlPd2w0TzZ4MHlOU0hqZ0plc2pHU0ZtSmY3M1BVWXR2ZEhOMjBuMktrQ1pudFVFbjc2MThWdFYwZnEtMzZrOVJMV0ZuTllsb01UUlVWSXJFWnRjTl91TXc</guid></item><item><title>根据TOP DOC ， 6个迹象表明您的童年创伤正在影响您成年后的生活-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/6-signs-your-childhood-trauma-is-affecting-you-as-an-adult-according-to-top-doc/articleshow/125667651.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to childhood trauma, “the past is past” simply doesn’t apply. The scars you carried as a child can quietly resurface years later, often without you even realising it. For many adults, the impact of painful childhood experiences is evident in their everyday lives, showing up in unexpected ways. In a video shared on Instagram, Dr Judith Joseph, a board-certified psychiatrist trained at Columbia University, New York Presbyterian Hospital, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, explains how childhood trauma can manifest in adulthood. Here are six signs of childhood trauma affecting your adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding childhood trauma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood trauma is much more serious than you imagine. It may have a long-term impact on your mental wellness. As children, developing brains adapt to survive in threatening environments. Though these survival mechanisms can be protective in early stages, they can persist into adulthood and create challenges in everyday situations. Dr Joseph also noted that the trauma response goes beyond the commonly discussed fight-or-flight reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Is Slapping Your Child Normal? | Abhijit Iyer Mitra on Parenting Myths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fight and flight are not the only symptoms related to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Other trauma reactions include Fawn and Freeze. There are over 20 symptoms of PTSD, and if you don’t display the most common ones, a diagnosis may be overlooked,” the psychiatrist said. The main categories of PTSD are intrusion symptoms, avoidance behaviours, changes in cognition and mood, and physical reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every traumatic event necessarily leads to PTSD. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about one half of all US adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;most do not develop PTSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by researchers at the University of Georgia, published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Development and Psychopathology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, found that adverse experiences and environments in childhood may cause &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/childhood-exposure-to-danger-increases-black-youths-alcohol-consumption-accelerated-aging-and-cardiac-risk-as-young-adults-a-test-of-the-incubation-hypothesis/3ADBB433F09D44CCCB469D9ABF4A4FCE" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a chain reaction of mental and physical health problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; later in life. “Things that happen to you in childhood, from how you’re raised as a child to the environment that you’re in, can lead to long-standing issues,” said Sierra Carter, co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 ways childhood trauma shows up in adult life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s take a look at how childhood trauma manifests in adulthood. According to Dr Joseph, the signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intense startle response:&lt;/strong&gt; even small sounds make you jump.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People-pleasing:&lt;/strong&gt; this trait develops because of deep feelings of unworthiness, according to the doctor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overspending or engaging in risky behaviours&lt;/strong&gt; to constantly live on the edge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypervigilance:&lt;/strong&gt; you are always afraid and believe you are in danger in some way, so your guard is always up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol abuse:&lt;/strong&gt; abusing alcohol because you have learned it calms the fight-or-flight response when triggered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anger outbursts:&lt;/strong&gt; intense reactions to very small triggers because even minor things are perceived as major slights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD can be easily overlooked if individuals do not display the most widely known symptoms. It can affect your everyday life and even your relationships. A 2025 study by Penn State researchers found that people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms often have &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39673913/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;trouble communicating and resolving relationship difficulties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; with their romantic partners. The study was published in the journal Behaviour Research and Therapy. The first step towards healing is recognising these signs. Understanding how childhood trauma manifests in adulthood can help you seek the support required and begin the recovery journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;Most of us think of orange juice as a simple breakfast habit, something you pour without much thought. Yet scientists are discovering that this everyday drink may be doing far more in the body than quenching thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has shown that regular orange juice consumption can influence the activity of thousands of genes inside our immune cells. Many of these genes help control blood pressure, calm inflammation, and manage the way the body processes sugar, all of which play an important role in long-term &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/heart-health-60216"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.70299"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; followed adults who drank 500ml of pure pasteurised orange juice every day for two months. After 60 days, many genes associated with inflammation and higher blood pressure had become less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cortisol-cocktails-are-the-latest-stress-busting-trend-heres-the-science"&gt;'Cortisol Cocktails' Are The Latest Stress-Busting Trend. Here's The Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included NAMPT, IL6, IL1B and NLRP3, which usually switch on when the body is under stress. Another gene known as SGK1, which affects the kidneys' ability to hold onto sodium (salt), also became less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such changes match &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319862089_Health_Benefits_of_Orange_Juice_and_Citrus_Flavonoids_Applications_in_Functional_Foods"&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that daily orange juice drinking can reduce blood pressure in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is noteworthy because it offers a possible explanation for why orange juice has been linked to better heart health &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1865263"&gt;in several trials&lt;/a&gt;. The new work shows that the drink does not simply raise blood sugar. Instead, it appears to trigger small shifts in the body's regulatory systems that reduce inflammation and help blood vessels relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural compounds in oranges, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284956/"&gt;particularly hesperidin&lt;/a&gt;, a citrus flavonoid known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, seem to influence processes related to high blood pressure, cholesterol balance and the way the body handles sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183296" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/orange_juice_642.jpg" alt="oranges and orange juice" class="wp-image-183296 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/orange_juice_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/orange_juice_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183296" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Compounds in oranges affect pathways linked with high blood pressure.

People carrying more weight tended to show greater changes in genes involved in fat metabolism, while leaner volunteers showed stronger effects on inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34060162/"&gt;systematic review of controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; involving 639 participants from 15 studies found that regular orange juice consumption lowered insulin resistance and blood cholesterol levels. Insulin resistance is a key feature of pre- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183269" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and high cholesterol is an established risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36383179/"&gt;Another analysis&lt;/a&gt; focusing on overweight and obese adults found small reductions in systolic blood pressure and increases in &lt;a href="https://labtestsonline.org.uk/tests/hdl-cholesterol-test"&gt;high-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt; (HDL), often called the good cholesterol, after several weeks of daily orange juice consumption. Although these changes are modest, even slight improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol can make a meaningful difference when maintained over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More clues come from studies that examine metabolites, the tiny molecules produced as the body processes food. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36383179/"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt; found that orange juice influences pathways related to energy use, communication between cells and inflammation. It may also affect the gut microbiome, which is increasingly understood to play a role in heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37469434/"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that drinking blood orange juice for a month increased the number of gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These compounds help maintain healthy blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Volunteers also showed improved blood sugar control and lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a cluster of risk factors that includes high blood pressure, raised blood sugar and excess body fat, may see particular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, daily orange juice consumption improved the function of the lining of blood vessels, known as endothelial function, in &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/orange-juice-combined-to-a-healthyeating-pattern-improved-endothelial-function-and-reduced-global-risk-of-chd-in-metabolic-syndrome-patients/D712014D8B24A2CC37CB9A99059F41D2"&gt;68 obese participants&lt;/a&gt;. Endothelial function describes how well blood vessels relax and widen, and better function is associated with a lower risk of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all studies report the same outcomes. A &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/orange-juice-combined-to-a-healthyeating-pattern-improved-endothelial-function-and-reduced-global-risk-of-chd-in-metabolic-syndrome-patients/D712014D8B24A2CC37CB9A99059F41D2"&gt;broader analysis&lt;/a&gt; of blood fat concentrations found that although levels of &lt;a href="https://labtestsonline.org.uk/tests/ldl-cholesterol-test"&gt;low density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt; (LDL), often called the bad cholesterol, often fall, other lipid measurements, such as triglycerides and HDL, may not change much. Even so, people who regularly drink orange juice may still benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-12-119"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; of 129 workers in an orange juice factory in Brazil reported lower blood concentrations of &lt;a href="https://labtestsonline.org.uk/tests/apo-b"&gt;apolipoprotein B&lt;/a&gt;, or apo-B, a marker that reflects the number of cholesterol-carrying particles linked to heart attack risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the evidence challenges the idea that drinking citrus fruit juice is simply consuming sugar in a glass. Whole fruit remains the better choice because of its fibre, but a modest daily glass of pure orange juice appears to have effects that build up over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include easing inflammation, supporting healthier blood flow and improving several blood markers linked to long-term heart health. It is a reminder that everyday foods can have more influence on the body than we might expect.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270492/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Chemically, however, it’s anything but simple. Right where air meets liquid, water molecules and dissolved ions arrange themselves in ways that control how gases react, how droplets age in the atmosphere, and how electric charges move in devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, chemists used a fairly tidy story to describe this boundary. Some ions were said to crowd toward the top of the liquid, while others were said to stay buried below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting separation of charge created a smooth electric field that lined up nearby water molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work from the &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/154064/polymer-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt; for Polymer Research in Germany takes a much closer look at that story and finds that the real surface of salty water is more structured and less tidy than that textbook picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-water-molecules-and-surfaces"&gt;Water molecules and surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the standard explanation, large, easily distorted ions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/iodide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iodide&lt;/a&gt;, were treated as surface lovers. They were expected to collect in the top layer of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller, less flexible ions such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fluoride&lt;/a&gt; were thought to avoid that boundary and stay deeper in the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If positive and negative ions separated even slightly near the surface, they would form an electric double layer – a thin charged region that nudged the &lt;a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/exploringourfluidearth/chemical/properties-water/hydrogen-bonds-make-water-sticky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;O-H bonds&lt;/a&gt; in water molecules to point more in one direction than in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scheme was applied to many common dissolved substances: sodium halides, hydroxide, sulfate, perchlorate, and similar ions found in seawater and in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-cycles-through-plants-with-unexpected-speed/"&gt;atmospheric droplets&lt;/a&gt;. The details varied from ion to ion, but the overall picture rested on that same double-layer idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laser-view-of-water-air-boundary"&gt;Laser view of water-air boundary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test how accurate that view was, researchers turned to a surface-specific laser technique called heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation, often shortened to HD-VSFG. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two laser beams of different colors hit the water-air boundary at the same time. Only molecules that sit at this boundary can generate a new beam whose color equals the sum of the two incoming colors, so the measured signal comes almost entirely from that surface region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That signal carries information about how O-H bonds vibrate and, through its sign, about whether those bonds tend to point toward the air or toward the deeper liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They first examined pure water. The spectrum at the boundary showed a sharp feature from O-H groups that were not hydrogen bonded and that stuck out from surface molecules, along with a broad band from hydrogen-bonded O-H groups underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp feature indicated so-called free O-H groups pointing outward, while many of the hydrogen-bonded groups leaned back toward the bulk liquid below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-ions-enter"&gt;When ions enter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissolving strong acids such as hydrochloric acid or salts with strongly surface-active anions such as perchlorate changed this pattern in a clear way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp free O-H peak weakened markedly, showing that these ions moved directly into the outermost layer and capped those exposed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-captured-on-video-forming-out-of-thin-air-for-the-first-time/"&gt;O-H groups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under those conditions, ions occupied the very top of the liquid, and the behavior lined up with the traditional electric double layer picture, with charges gathered at the interface and water molecules responding to their combined field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More familiar salts behaved differently. Solutions containing sodium chloride, sodium fluoride, sodium bromide, sodium iodide, sodium hydroxide, cesium fluoride, and several sulfate salts left the sharp free O-H feature largely intact, even at high concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measurements showed that even at high concentrations, the outermost &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pfas-forever-chemicals-in-tap-water-linked-to-33-percent-increase-in-cancer-rates/"&gt;layer of water&lt;/a&gt; stayed mostly free of ions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the broad band from hydrogen-bonded O-H groups changed strongly, with its shape and strength depending on which ions were present and how concentrated the solution was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ions therefore reorganized water near the boundary from just below the surface, rather than filling that top layer themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work demonstrates that the surface of simple electrolyte solutions has a different ion distribution than previously thought and that the ion-enriched subsurface determines how the interface is organized: at the very top there are a few layers of pure water, then an ion-rich layer, then finally the bulk salt solution,” explained co-first author Dr Yair Litman, from the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-water-molecule-layers"&gt;Water molecule layers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this layered region, water molecules responded mainly to nearby ions rather than to one smooth electric field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a positively charged ion such as sodium, water molecules oriented so that their oxygen atoms faced the ion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a negatively charged ion such as hydroxide or a halide, water molecules flipped the other way, with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-catalyst-precatalyst-improves-clean-hydrogen-production-to-99-9-efficiency/"&gt;hydrogen atoms&lt;/a&gt; pointing toward the ion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With many ions in the subsurface zone, this produced patches in which water molecules preferred one orientation and other patches where they preferred the opposite orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mixture of water molecules pointing in different directions produced a complicated pattern in the HD-VSFG signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of the signal looked as if water were polarized one way, while other parts looked as if the water were polarized the other way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple model with one broad &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sunlights-hidden-power-supercharges-water-evaporation/"&gt;electric field&lt;/a&gt; pushing water mostly in a single direction could not explain that dual behavior, but the stratified arrangement with ion-poor and ion-rich layers could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-thin-layer-matters"&gt;Why this thin layer matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salty water surfaces play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. Tiny sea-salt droplets host reactions that influence climate and air quality, and many of those reactions occur at or near the boundary between air and liquid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because ions concentrate in a subsurface zone instead of right at the top of the droplet, the way gases enter droplets, how acids and bases behave there, and how pollutants transform can all differ from what older models predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar ideas may apply to electrolytes near electrodes in batteries and to solutions near biological membranes in living cells, where charge distributions at boundaries affect how energy and signals move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show a reversal of current textbook models, suggesting that, instead of imagining heavy ions clustering directly at the surface, we should picture a thin, layered interface that gently reshapes the hydrogen-bonding patterns of water just below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01416-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:58:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQTEh2ZWhCcEJOOFdURVozV1lNUjNOclNoeTljQThiNUJ0OUk5dzliaGZiWGtxRURlc0VONGw3SFJTano2MG8xcVllbjcxZzFyQjdCQWp1ZTU3YS1nZXJqLThnaTFSdUNwYjhLTUtILXBwN0s4VWNsUWs4eG93WWw1RUdOckdLS2JBWlhab1pZdzdWVTN0UjQ2eDA4Vm9rdF96ZU9YMWlCd0U</guid></item><item><title>麻疹病例激增是“火灾警报” ，警告其他疾病可能是下一个- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/surging-measles-cases-fire-alarm-103000240.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A nurse administers a dose of the measles vaccine to a man during a vaccination campaign in response to a measles outbreak, in Mexico City on Nov. 12. (Raquel Cunha / Reuters)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s crucial to understand why measles matters,” said Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. “Its high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet," O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/journals/weekly-epidemiological-record" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Weekly Epidemiological Record;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Weekly Epidemiological Record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most in a decade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most in a decade&lt;/a&gt;. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination status threatened&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus — smallpox — has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBC News investigation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-will-us-rcna242630" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Canada met that threshold;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Canada met that threshold&lt;/a&gt; this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs "are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency "expects those results in the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna240592" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow.

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Two years after the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/338553/fda-gives-thumbs-up-to-first-postpartum-depression-pill.html"&gt;approved a unique pill&lt;/a&gt; designed to treat postpartum depression, an analysis at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-pill-can-save-moms-from-postpartum-depression-within-days/"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides an optimistic update: It's working. The drug, zuranalolone, "has since relieved depression in thousands of women," writes Marla Broadfoot. The story takes a big-picture look at the entire issue, including how postpartum depression often gets shrugged off as the "baby blues." And while it's true that most new moms experience hormonal mood swings that resolve in a few weeks after childbirth, it's also true that some women—an estimated 500,000 in the US each year—suffer a debilitating form of depression that endangers their lives as well as their babies' lives.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            

                            &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;

                                        Studies suggest these women are particularly sensitive to a drop in two particular hormones that occur after delivery. Meaning, it is biological, not merely the "baby blues." When doctors first came around to recognizing the problem—it's still not recognized as a standalone mental illness—they grouped it under depression and treated it as such. The problem is that traditional antidepressants aren't always effective. Zuranolone, a synthetic neurosteroid, is designed to counteract the drop in hormones after birth. "It can work remarkably well for more than half of people, and it's rapid-acting," says Samantha Meltzer-Brody of the North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. "That's a game changer."

                                        As one patient quoted in the story puts it, "I could literally feel this huge cloud lifting over me. ... Every day I got better and better." The drug made by Sage Therapeutics isn't cheap, at $8,000 a week for a two-week course, but most insurers, including Medicaid, now cover it, and manufacturer assistance is available for eligible patients.

But a few stubborn kilos just wouldn't budge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She had tried everything, she says. Going on a stricter diet; being more consistent with her high-intensity workouts six days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But "nothing worked" for the Brazilian lawyer who weighed 76kg (11st 13lb) and is 1.69m tall (5ft 6in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then, friends let her in on a secret - they'd been using weight-loss injections and were thrilled with the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So despite being a long-standing fitness fanatic, Gabriela, 40, decided to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She bought her first Ozempic jabs in February 2024 from a pharmacy in Rio de Janeiro – with no prescription - and began taking them without medical oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results were almost immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It was surreal," recalls Gabriela, which is not her real name. "I'd go to a Japanese buffet, eat six pieces of sushi and feel like I'd had a whole rack of ribs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The transformation was noticeable, but it didn't last. When she stopped taking the injections, slowly but surely, the weight crept back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That's when Gabriela's new routine began. She would stop taking the jabs when she was satisfied with the way she looked. But when the reflection in the mirror wasn't quite what she wanted, the process would begin again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She's been going through this cycle for a year now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When I look in the mirror and like what I see, everything in life feels easier," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors warn that people like Gabriela, who have no medical need for weight-loss jabs and are taking them intermittently and without clinical supervision, are gambling with their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the UK, the National Health Service generally won't prescribe weight-loss jabs - which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger and make you feel full for longer - unless your body mass index (BMI) is above 35 or 40, depending on the drug. The threshold is lower for some ethnic groups and people with certain weight-related health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Gabriela's BMI was 26.6 when she started taking the jabs. She had no weight-related conditions and was a muscular woman who regularly did high-intensity exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is a growing trend of its use for cosmetic purposes," says Dr Bharti Shetye, vice-president of the Obesity Medicine Association in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I hear of so many cases of people using it just to look good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor and endocrinologist Simone van de Sande Lee is clear: "These are drugs approved to treat conditions like diabetes or obesity - they are not cosmetic tools."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'I felt like I was a bit puffy'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Andrew, 49, was also far below the threshold for being prescribed weight-loss drugs in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A top executive of a food company used to hosting lavish parties in his central London penthouse, it was feeling unhappy about his appearance that compelled him to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I felt like I was a bit puffy… I didn't feel good about myself," the 49-year-old, who also asked for his real name not to be used, says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I came back from Christmas holidays and thought, 'I'm going to fix this somehow.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the time, Andrew weighed around 90kg (14st 2lb) at 1.83m (6ft) tall, though like Gabriela he was also muscular. This gave him a BMI of 26.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Despite this, Andrew says he was able to obtain the jabs from an online pharmacy, simply by completing a self-assessment. As far as he is aware, no-one checked if what he'd written was accurate or whether the treatment was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In early 2024, he began weekly injections of Wegovy and later Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/559aea20-c629-11f0-90df-d5791d4064ec.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Courtesy of Andrew A picture of a faceless man with a bare, muscular torso on the beach, wearing blue shorts." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Courtesy of Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Andrew started fat-loss jabs, even though he did not meet the threshold set in the UK&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Almost immediately what I felt with the jab is that the food noise went away from me… I really enjoyed not having to think about food so much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now, Andrew still goes out to restaurants but eats much less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I never feel, or very rarely feel, that urgent hunger that I used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Like Gabriela, he cycles on and off the jabs depending on social events.

some without medical need - we may begin to see rare side effects more regularly," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Common side effects of the drugs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But rarer and more serious ones include acute gallstone disease, pancreatitis and serious allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Gabriela says her only issue so far has been mild stomach pain, which she blames on a combination of not eating and drinking alcohol while using the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I was going through a wild phase," she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Another drawback of the jabs is that they can cause people to lose muscle as well as fat, and this is likely to be particularly true for those who are slimmer, says Halpern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Slim individuals on restrictive diets tend to lose muscle more than fat," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If they regain weight later, their body composition worsens," he adds, noting that this "yo-yo cycle" of losing and regaining "raises the long-term risk of weight gain," especially when cycling on and off the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The patient leaflets for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro recommend once‑weekly injections on a fixed schedule under medical supervision, indicating the drugs are intended for regular, continuous use rather than occasional or sporadic dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They are meant to be injected into the upper arm, thigh, or stomach, with doses gradually increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Emotional toll&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are also psychological dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Halpern says he sees patients who imagine that if they lose weight they'll feel loved, happy and accepted, but these expectations are rarely realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When people stop taking jabs and the weight returns, they often feel like failures, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Another challenge is that our bodies tend to resist long-term weight loss, explains Dr Cork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When you lose weight, your body doesn't just say, 'Great, job done.' Hunger hormones ramp up, your metabolism slows, and your body tries to restore what it sees as your natural point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He points out that as soon as patients stop taking the jabs, which suppress hunger signals, the body resumes its fight to regain the weight it has lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is why they are intended for long-term use in patients who need them, he says, stressing that obesity is a chronic disease. In the UK, NHS guidelines currently limit the use of weight-loss drugs to a maximum of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;No plans to stop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In early 2025, Britain's General Pharmaceutical Council tightened restrictions on how online pharmacies can sell and prescribe the jabs in response to growing concerns about misuse, safety and supply shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Brazil also tightened the rules this year around the prescribing of the drugs for similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Despite the risks, Gabriela and Andrew say they have no plans to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I think I've become addicted to it," admits Gabriela, while Andrew sees the drug as a long-term commitment to his appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He sees it as a "relatively informed risk" he's taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If I happen to cycle on and off this for the rest of my life, that would probably be OK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:04:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9TYmhCWWMwSHZLcjlqVkstNk52RWpsZEpXQkQ5MV9tTFdQcmRCUERhNjdaQXBMQWtSY3MxOWtNejlZWDhXZnp2TnkyS2dHQV9EYVFYM3dLc2lld9IBX0FVX3lxTE1BRjZSOTd4WXkwbHR1a2Z0YjIwbnlXb0k3LWRINUw1Z1lKY3FZelpwQTJXbC1PS2dWcjE1MWZTemxsLVBzd04yNXpvNlBOaHRPRmV4WWpKc3dZRWs5ZVYw</guid></item><item><title>这项90秒的测试有望使数百万人免受结肠镜检查的影响-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-90-second-test-promising-to-spare-millions-from-colonoscopy-b6sdwh7kp</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 90-second test for bowel cancer could spare more than half a million people a year from invasive colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Experts believe the test, which can rapidly rule out the disease in 80 per cent of patients with worrying symptoms, could make a significant dent in NHS waiting lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Oricol test, made by the Cambridge-based company Origin Sciences, uses a “triomic” approach that assesses three factors: genetic mutations, the epigenetic chemical tags that switch genes on and off, and the bacteria associated with early cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study of 800 patients tested in Shropshire, to be published in the Nature Communications science journal this week, confirmed that this approach accurately separates healthy patients from those with cancer. It also picks up polyps, a sign that&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; cancer could be on the way. Scientists describe the test as a “biological tape recorder”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Given by a nurse at a community diagnostics centre, it cannot definitively diagnose bowel cancer. Instead those who receive a positive result must have a colonoscopy in hospital. But the study results confirm it is an accurate way of giving the majority of patients the all-clear, meaning they never require the more invasive test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If a larger study, due to be published next year, confirms the test is an accurate way of ruling out bowel cancer it could be quickly introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;NHS officials are watching the technology with interest. Almost 44,000 people a year in Britain are &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/bowel-cancer-symptoms-diet-age-888hh9kz2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;diagnosed with bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;, also known as colorectal cancer, and it kills 17,500 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About 750,000 people in Britain each year are referred for a colonoscopy after displaying the warning signs, which include blood in the stool. A colonoscopy, in which a long flexible tube with a camera is used to examine the inside of the large intestine, is the gold standard for diagnosing bowel cancer. But it is invasive and expensive, costing the NHS between £800 and £1,200 per patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jon Lacy-Colson, a colorectal surgeon at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, which has been using the Oricol test, said: “A colonoscopy requires bowel prep, it requires taking two days off work and then 45 minutes having this invasive test. For every 100 patients who have a colonoscopy after reporting symptoms, four of them have got cancer. Sixteen of them have got a significant polyp. The remaining 80 don’t have anything serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He said the Oricol test meant those 80 per cent of patients without problems could be given the all-clear without enduring a colonoscopy. Nationally, that would mean reducing the number of colonoscopies conducted on the NHS by at least 600,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And it is far quicker. “Under the old system it took us 14 days just to see people for a colonoscopy,” Lacy-Colson said. “We’re seeing people for this test at day three.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oricol, which is expected to cost the NHS less than £300 per test, involves inserting a small syringe into the rectum. A balloon is briefly inserted, deflated then removed. It is then analysed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Parminder Dhani, 65, from Telford, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in June after taking part in the Oricol trial. She was referred by her GP after experiencing stomach pain. Getting the new test was “very quick, very easy and quite comfortable”, she said. A colonoscopy confirmed she had bowel cancer and she was referred for surgery. The speed of the process was remarkable, she said. “It all happened really quickly — from the process to actually having it removed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.13"&gt;&lt;div id="1ff32aba-7ec1-42b6-abc8-91cec1cf012a"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__SecondaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-5 guQatV"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;COURTESY OF PARMINDER DHANI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lord Prior of Brampton, a former health minister and former chairman of NHS England, is convinced the test could have a significant impact. “It could be a big thing for the NHS,” said Prior, who chairs the Origin Science advisory committee. “It could make a massive difference both to patient outcomes and to the cost of diagnostics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bowel cancer is frequently picked up too late. Deborah James, the cancer blogger who became famous as “BowelBabe”, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/obituaries/article/dame-deborah-james-obituary-bq2rtbs8k" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;died in 2022&lt;/a&gt; aged 40, five and a half years after being diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer. She went to the GP several times with symptoms but waited so long for a colonoscopy that she paid to have one privately. Bowel cancer referrals in England have &lt;a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/dashboards/ers-open-data" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;risen from 360,000 to a peak of 419,000 a week&lt;/a&gt; since James died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jo Williams, group chief executive of Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, where 2,000 patients have had the test, said: “This new test could revolutionise the entire colon cancer diagnostic pathway and have a huge impact on our patients. It will make it a more comfortable experience for patients, particularly for those who find tests and a healthcare setting a stressful experience. If successful, the test could lead to a reduction in the number of patients requiring a colonoscopy and cancer could be diagnosed at an earlier stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hugo Lywood, chief executive of Origin Sciences, said in future the company’s device could be used to test for several cancers at once. It could also be used to vastly improve the bowel cancer screening programme, in which everyone aged 50 to 74 is offered an at home test every two years assessing blood in the stool. “The screening programme only picks up 10 per cent of all cases of colorectal cancer in the UK,” said Lywood. The remainder are picked up when symptoms arise, typically once the disease has advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lywood attributed this to the low sensitivity of the faecal screening test sent through the post, which is set low so &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;the NHS&lt;/a&gt; is not overwhelmed by demand for colonoscopies. If Oricol were used as an interim test, to confirm the faecal test findings but before colonoscopy, the sensitivity of the initial test could be raised. “We think we could shift that 10 per cent of cases found through screening to 60 per cent,” Lywood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And because his test is good at picking up polyps or advanced adenomas, an early sign that cancer could be on the way, it could trigger early treatment. Lywood said: “In that case it becomes a cancer prevention tool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPOUJKa3QtcWxYeTFvdkUzbzllR1hLRS0xcXhxc0sydHFlREJzRFoyUjRiazBJRF9fX0N4MXllSzUteUFYWmw4Sjh4VEc3ekxWRVVoOEVUdmVsUzRIeVViQktkZV9CSVhLMUx0UWJaWnRlWVZFUU5kNkw1TUlFM3FwS2xMYjdNcUoyLVBmME1la1N1NEgwdXpGOWpIOC1rZXNfWG9FVFlVaHp0MEk4SEMzdkxvejh4Q0FNNzR2eA</guid></item><item><title>睡眠专家揭示梦中牙齿脱落背后的令人不安的含义-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/sleep-expert-reveals-disturbing-meanings-behind-teeth-falling-out-in-your-dreams/articleshow/125662600.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever jolted awake convinced your teeth were crumbling out of your mouth, you’re in good company. A recent survey of 2,000 people in the UK, commissioned by Netflix in connection with its animated film In Your Dreams, suggests that teeth-falling-out dreams sit alongside falling, being chased and unexpectedly turning up naked in public as some of the nation’s most frequently reported nocturnal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than dismissing them as random, one dream expert says they can act like a quiet guide to what’s really on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Simple Bedtime Practices From Sadhguru For Better Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Dreams are like a friend” &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delphi Ellis, a qualified counsellor, mindfulness practitioner and author of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Answers In The Dark: Grief, Sleep and How Dreams Can Help You Heal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, was asked to interpret the patterns that emerged from the Netflix survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dreams are like a friend, they can softly nudge us in the direction of what we want, point us towards what might help us heal, or offer insight, even answers, into a problem that's occupying our mind. It's one reason we say, 'sleep on it'.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may or may not act on them, but Ellis says it’s at least worth paying attention. “Like a friend, we can choose to acknowledge or ignore them, it's up to us what we do with the content of our dreams, but it's always worth listening to what a dream has to say.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dream in particular clearly struck a nerve in the survey: teeth falling out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What it could mean when your teeth fall out in a dream &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the familiar catalogue of unsettling dreams, one stands out as uniquely distressing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While being chased or falling can feel metaphorically frightening, dreaming about your teeth feels bodily, primal, almost horror-coded. Around 21 percent of respondents said they’ve dreamt of their teeth falling out, sometimes crumbling like chalk, sometimes dropping into their hands, sometimes suddenly vanishing from their mouth. It’s one of the most upsetting dream types precisely because it feels so physical and intimately connected to identity, appearance and even survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis suggests it may be linked to how secure you feel about status, money or what you’re “worth” in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the West we generally exchange our teeth for money when we are little,” she explained. That early swap, tooth for coin, can leave a symbolic trace: teeth become quietly linked in our minds with value, reward and what we “deserve”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that light, a dream where they fall out might reflect anxiety about security or standing in life rather than dentistry itself. A promotion that didn’t happen, financial pressure, feeling like you’re losing your grip on a role or image you’ve worked hard for – any of those could show up in this sort of dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For others, Ellis says, the symbolism leans more towards loss than money. “In some cultures, dreaming of teeth as they literally are (as bone) may symbolize anxiety about losing someone significant.” That could be a fear about a relationship changing, a loved one becoming more distant, or a general dread of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if your teeth are falling out in a dream, your brain may be playing out deeper worries about what you might be about to lose – whether that’s status, stability or someone close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Falling, running, flying: other common dream themes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Netflix-commissioned survey asked 2,000 UK adults about their most frequent dreams. Ellis emphasises that these aren’t definitive meanings, just recurring emotional patterns, but the data reveals how common these themes really are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling – 53% Unable to run – 42% Partner cheating – 22% Someone dying – 21% Teeth falling out – 21% Snogging a celebrity – 20% Exam you haven't revised for – 19% Flying – 18% Friends/family being mean – 16% Being late – 15% Finding money – 14% Unable to find the toilet – 12% Naked in public – 12% &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Falling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common dream of all in the survey was falling – reported by more than half of those asked. Ellis links this to uncertainty and change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It happens if we're not sure where we're going or where we'll end up,” she said. “It's especially common after redundancy, retirement and other major life changes. The adventure awaits, but can be scary as we venture into the unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also draws a line between that lingering dream of falling and the sharp “jolt” some people feel just as they’re dropping off to sleep. That physical startle, she notes, “can (ironically) be caused by over tiredness or point to signs of stress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Being chased but unable to run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 42 percent of people said they’ve dreamt of trying to run, but feeling as if their legs won’t move. Ellis says this can mirror feeling behind or hemmed in in waking life: “The feeling of not being able to run can symbolise being ‘stuck’ in a situation, that progress is too slow, or the fear that whatever it is will ‘catch up’ with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Partners cheating and people dying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over a fifth of respondents said they had dreamt of a partner cheating. Ellis is clear that this usually speaks more to fear than to fact. “Dreaming about infidelity often signals a fear that it could occur, rather than serving as a warning that it already has, particularly for those who have experienced betrayal in the past,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;People dying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dreams of people dying, reported by a similar proportion, are often about change rather than literal death. Ellis notes that for many parents, dreaming about a child dying is really about watching a particular phase of childhood “end” as they become more independent, and the relationship shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Flying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 18 percent of people reported dreams of flying. Ellis says how it feels in the dream is crucial. “If the dream is positive and they’re loving it – ‘flying high’ may signify someone enjoying a period of success.” If the mood is anxious or out of control, it might be a sign you feel you should “keep your feet on the ground” for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Mean friends and families&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreams where family or friends are unkind can reflect a quiet worry about belonging. Sixteen percent of people surveyed say they’ve experienced this, and Ellis suggests it may be tied to a fear of exclusion or strained social ties. “If people are being mean, the dream may be a prompt to reconsider who we include in our circle,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Being late&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreams about being late, reported by 15 percent of respondents, tend to mirror real-life anxieties around time, performance or pressure. Ellis explains: “In today’s world, it’s natural to fear being late, so this may be a literal dream reflecting what we worry could happen.” But it can also signal the feeling of missing out, socially, professionally or personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Finding money &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding money in a dream, something 14 percent of people reported, may simply echo financial stress. Ellis notes: “If a person has money worries, it makes sense for them to have this dream; wealth is subjective though, so the money may also be a symbol for something else the dreamer feels might improve their life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Celebrity romance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreaming of a romantic encounter with a celebrity, about one in five of us have, often reflects admiration or identification. “If we can relate to a particular celebrity’s struggle, or if we see someone… as a role model, or if we admire them – we may dream about them as if they are closer to us than they really are,” Ellis said. It’s less about desire and more about projection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unprepared exam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dreaded no-revision exam dream, still experienced by 19 percent of adults, may reflect feeling unprepared for something in waking life, a conversation, a decision, a responsibility. But Ellis adds it may reach back into feelings from adolescence: “Exams usually happen at school… harking back to past anxieties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unable to find the toilet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being unable to find the toilet appears in 12 percent of people’s dreams. Sometimes it really is just your physical body saying Wake up, you need the bathroom. But Ellis notes: “This dream can signify you are in a time of your life where you lack privacy and searching for more private time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Naked in public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, being naked in public, also reported by around 12 percent, can indicate vulnerability. Ellis said: “It may reflect the awareness of being ‘on show’ or in the spotlight for some reason… or that we’ve talked about something that left us feeling vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="127"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="128"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make sense of your dreams &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Netflix survey and Ellis’s interpretations offer a useful starting point, but dream meaning is not one-size-fits-all. Two people can have the same dream and take away something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical and cognitive hypnotherapist Sarah Bick, who works with the subconscious mind at Inna Therapies, suggests treating your dreams as personal messages rather than universal codes. She recommends writing your dream down in detail as soon as you wake, then noting what each element brings to mind &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;for you,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; without looking up generic meanings first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A symbol like “teeth” might, for one person, immediately call up childhood memories of the tooth fairy and money; for another, it could evoke a painful dental experience, or a parent who worked in healthcare. The same image will sit on top of very different histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="138"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bick advises connecting the dream back to what’s happening in your life now: current stresses, transitions, or unresolved feelings. From there, you can start to piece together a message that gives you that small “aha” moment, not a prediction of the future, but a reflection of where your mind is already working hard behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="141"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="142"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you be worried? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="143"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, you don’t need to panic about a disturbing dream, even if it’s vivid. Having your teeth fall out at night doesn’t mean they’re about to fall out during the day; dreaming of a partner cheating rarely means they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="145"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Ellis and Bick both frame dreams as another channel of information about how you’re coping. A string of anxiety dreams might be your cue to look at stress, sleep routines or unspoken worries. A recurring teeth-falling-out dream might nudge you to examine where you feel insecure about status, money or loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="147"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dreams are “like a friend”, as Ellis puts it, then even the unsettling ones may be on your side – not trying to frighten you, but drawing your attention to something you’ve been too busy, or too tired, to fully notice when you’re awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxPLTRWekdJU3NLZ2FsOGY4Y0dZbmNrV1Nqa3dYVkJHd1lXN25yVDZMME4zNlZISjlmeWdIZFNtVFluMnhieWFEa2JMUDlWcjliLUhqX3FORnF6RHlMTnZLRGlRYy1uRnA3T1plT2V6dk5hR1lJX1JaM1Y3b1J1Tm1HU0V5cWFwZDZGcERjQk1lUTBibUVfUUVSRTRpRnl2dEl6Nl9ROGJjTlZaSGQ1ZDRoT0lBdnh4enVkZVdXNkZnTkFJaXIzSFRpSFU5aFB6aC1UOGJHWWc2dXF2WDlSVmVWejZHcGJYejY5RXdVN3pCbUhwM2lJaFRMZUZWd0JqM28tV1QxWUx2SFFLMmc5</guid></item><item><title>经常吃南瓜？南瓜对身体的5大健康益处-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/eating-pumpkin-regularly-5-health-benefits-of-pumpkin-for-your-body/articleshow/125664278.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think pumpkin is just meant for those warm lattes and gooey pies, then its numerous health benefits for the body can be surprising. The perfect autumn vegetable is worth more than just carvings and drinks. It is one of the most beneficial produces of the season whose diversity in dishes and health is still undermined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pumpkin: Nutritional components&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its peel, flesh and seeds, every part of the winter squash is useful and in numerous ways. As per a 2022 study in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9182978/#B66-plants-11-01394" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Plants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, pumpkin has protein, carotenoids, tocopherols, antioxidants, polysaccharides, amino acids, minerals, vitamins, phenolic compounds and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of minerals, pumpkin has calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc and more. Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin B, Vitamin E and Vitamin K are the vitamins it's packed with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its high nutritional content it can be helpful in preventing and healing various diseases. Here's how eating pumpkin is good for your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Boosts immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin is enriched with many nutrients that boost immunity, which is a must in the winter. It's rich in beta-carotene which the body uses to make Vitamin A. This vitamin is vital in helping the body fight infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also has Vitamin C which helps increase white blood cell production, improves the work of immune cells and speeds up wound healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protects eyesight&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With increasing age, eyesight becomes weak. But if you load up on pumpkin every winter, the results can be different. It has Vitamin A, Zeaxanthin and Lutein, all of which promote eye health. As per a 2019 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522030854?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, these three nutrients were associated with a 19% reduced risk of age-related cataract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improves weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cup of cooked pumpkin has 94% water and fewer than 50 calories. Thus, while it is a tasty addition to your winter recipes, it helps you prevent the bulk of weight which is a concern during the season for many. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevents diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin is one of the handful of foods that help prevent diabetes. It lowers the activity of glycosidase, which increases blood glucose levels. Additionally, pumpkin polysaccharide was seen to have a hypoglycemic effect to lower fasting blood sugar levels in rats in a 2019 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/5/955" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Molecules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Additionally, it is also known to have pancrea-protective effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lowers the risk of cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer is one of the most common diseases in the United States. Pumpkin consumption can actually lower the risk of developing it. The food is rich in carotenoid levels, beta-carotene and lutein levels were associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, as per a 2023 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10694674/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with these health benefits, pumpkin has numerous other effects on the human body, all positive. Thus, adding it to your regular diet this winter could boost health like never before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

When 9:30 p.m. hit, everything shut down with the force of a government mandate. The lights out, TV off, Nintendo put away, prayers said, and eyes glued shut, whether sleep was coming or not. As a lifelong night owl, it felt like torture lying there in the dark, tossing around like a rotisserie chicken, hoping sleep would magically happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, as a chronically exhausted adult who wishes I'd developed even one healthy sleep habit, I cannot help but laugh and relate when I see someone who takes bedtime more seriously than I ever did. And by someone, I mean a golden retriever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐶&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bedtime Announcement That Took Over TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the viral video, this Golden Retriever has decided that the household is done for the night, whether the guests agree or not. The overlay text reads, "My Dog coming to remind our guests that it is 9pm and lights better be out because he has a strict bedtime routine." With the seriousness of a hotel manager enforcing quiet hours, he trots out carrying two essential items: his favorite blanket and a plush Patrick Star from &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As he marches up to the lingering guests, the audio choice is comedic perfection: the iconic scene from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; where Dwight sings, "Learn your rules, you better learn your rules, if you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep." The combination of his earnest little face, his bedtime gear, and Dwight Schrute threatening sleep-time consequences in the background? Pure PetTok gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And TikTok agrees. One person wrote, "Omg how sweet! Goldens are so funny," while another joked, "Mr. grumpy is not grumpy 😍." Someone else added, "He runs a strict program," and honestly, the evidence supports the fact that this dog is the CEO of Lights Out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/dog-emergency-text-mom-dad-154000376.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Dog's Emergency Text to Mom About Dad Has TikTok Losing It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Dog's Emergency Text to Mom About Dad Has TikTok Losing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why TikTok Can't Get Enough of This Sleep Sergeant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of the charm is how deeply committed he is to the role. He doesn't bark, whine or pace. Instead, he politely presents his blanket, stares directly at the humans, and waits. The message is clear: 9 p.m. means bedtime, and the lights better be out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's a vibe that's both hilarious and painfully relatable. Plenty of pet parents chimed in with their own stories of pets enforcing nightly routines, from cats demanding sink water at tooth-brushing time to dogs who practically escort guests to the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This golden retriever may not run the household's social calendar, but he definitely runs the sleep schedule.
