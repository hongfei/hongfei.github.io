&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This versatile high-protein dip is the perfect companion for your favorite veggies. Made with Greek-style yogurt and sour cream and blended with Parmesan cheese and Worcestershire sauce, it’s reminiscent of the flavors in Caesar salad dressing. Whether served as an appetizer or a quick snack, this protein-packed Caesar dip makes eating more veggies effortless.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This cottage cheese snack jar is a high-protein snack that layers creamy cottage cheese with crunchy bell peppers and crispy chickpeas. Cottage cheese provides protein and calcium, while chickpeas add extra plant-based protein and fiber to keep you feeling full until your next meal. A sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning brings bold flavors in every bite.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This easy, high-protein snack tastes just like a Reese’s peanut butter cup. You can conveniently make it in the yogurt container for quick cleanup. Alternatively, if you don’t have a single-serve container, scoop 1/2 cup yogurt from a larger container into a small bowl. Any nut or seed butter would work well in this four-ingredient recipe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Create a creamy on-the-go snack by combining protein-packed cottage cheese with sweet chopped peaches. When peaches are out of season, opt for frozen or experiment with an alternative such as chopped strawberries or orange segments. Elevate the flavor profile by adding a hint of vanilla extract or cinnamon to the cottage cheese. For those with a sweet tooth, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup is the perfect finishing touch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With a focus on fiber-rich beans, vegetables and healthy fats, this creamy bean dip is suitable for those following the Mediterranean diet. Tangy sun-dried tomatoes add a pop of acidity and make this dip reminiscent of Marry Me Chicken. We use carrots, peppers, radishes and snap peas for dunking, but you can use your favorite crunchy veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy milk and Greek-style yogurt provide a solid protein base for this chocolate-strawberry protein shake. Sweet strawberries, sliced banana and rich cocoa powder create a sweet flavor without needing any added sugar. Tossing in a few ice cubes chills the shake down and gives it a refreshing, frosty texture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These pumpkin pie spice energy balls are everything you could want in a snack: classic pumpkin spice flavor with a satisfyingly chewy texture with bits of crunch from seeds and nuts throughout. It’s worth seeking out cashew or almond butter to make these—they have a more neutral flavor that lets the spices and pumpkin shine, but any nut butter will work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This blueberry-banana peanut butter parfait is a delicious layered breakfast that combines fruit, yogurt and nutty goodness. Sliced bananas and juicy blueberries are stacked between creamy yogurt and swirls of peanut butter for a sweet and satisfying meal. Chunky peanut butter adds a bit of crunch for extra texture, but smooth peanut butter blends in beautifully if you prefer a silkier bite.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tomato toast features a creamy ricotta cheese spread and, of course, juicy ripe summer tomatoes. A serrated knife makes cutting thin slices of the heirloom tomatoes easier when they are on the softer side. If you have cherry tomatoes on hand, they will work well too, either sliced or blistered under the broiler.

Paying attention to subtle changes and acting promptly is the best defence against colon cancer,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Subtle' warning signs of bowel cancer are 'often overlooked', Dr Jack Ogden (pictured), a GP at The Lagom Clinic in Bristol, told the Daily Mail &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dame Deborah James, nicknamed the 'bowel babe' raised more than £11.3mn for Cancer Research and is credited for increasing awareness of the disease, which killed her in 2022 aged 40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first, commonly overlooked sign is iron deficiency anemia, which can present as 'unexplained fatigue, pale skin or shortness of breath', Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anemia is a condition when the body doesn't have enough red blood cells to pump oxygen around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also cause symptoms like chest pain, heart palpitations, headaches and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because tumours can bleed, causing iron loss and cause inflammation that produces a protein which interferes with iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, constipation, diarrhoea, or suddenly noticing narrower stools with no clear cause, is another key easy-to-dismiss subtle bowel cancer sign, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pencil-thin stools can be an indicator that a tumour is obstructing the colon causing it to squeeze stool into a thinner shape, Dr Ogden added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, losing weight without changing diet or exercising more is the third pain free sign, that may indicate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, he said it doesn't have to be sudden—it can also be subtle or gradual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often this weight loss can be caused by increased metabolic demand, loss of appetite and tumours preventing the absorption of nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bloating and abdominal discomfort, equally, is the fourth 'subtle' sign of the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may present itself as 'persistent cramping' or feel full quickly after eating, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fifth sign, he warned, was blood in the stool—which isn't always necessarily as obvious as it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood can be dark or hidden and only detectable via stool tests, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If stools are dark red or black it can be a sign bleeding is taking place higher up in the bowel due to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, bright red blood is most commonly caused by haemorrhoids, also known as piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, anyone experiencing these symptoms for three weeks or more is advised to speak to their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;James Van Der Beek, who lives in Texas , revealed in November that he had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer in August 2023, aged just 46&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowel cancer symptoms can also be caused by other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, but it's important to get checked so the disease can be spotted as early as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the vast majority of bowel cancer diagnoses affect those aged over 50, rates in older age-groups has either declined or held stable while diagnoses in younger adults have risen by 50 per cent over the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer Research UK estimates that over half (54 per cent) of bowel cancer cases in the UK are preventable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have suggested obesity, antibiotic over-use, mobile phone radiation and even invisible particles of plastic in drinking water are potential triggers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent global review found rates of colorectal cancer—also known as bowel cancer —in under-50s are climbing in 27 out of 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;England has one of the steepest increases, with cases in younger adults rising by an average of 3.6 per cent a year, while in the US, the rate is going up by around two per cent annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When we sleep, the body releases its '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"&gt;growth hormone&lt;/a&gt;', building up and repairing muscles and bones – but the details of how and why have been something of a mystery, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a close analysis of brain circuitry in mice, researchers led by a team from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) have found special mechanisms and feedback loops that regulate growth hormone release &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;while we sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could help us better treat conditions that come with sleep problems, including type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174439" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/delayed-rem-sleep-may-be-an-early-signal-of-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding sleep is the key to understanding a whole host of aspects of our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/better-sleep-could-help-your-brain-flush-out-dementia-linked-toxins"&gt;Better Sleep Could Help Your Brain Flush Out Dementia-Linked Toxins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People know that growth hormone release is tightly related to sleep, but only through drawing blood and checking growth hormone levels during sleep," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Xinlu Ding, from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're actually directly recording neural activity in mice to see what's going on. We are providing a basic circuit to work on in the future to develop different treatments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg" alt="Mouse experiments diagram" class="wp-image-174442 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers analyzed the release of growth hormone in mice during sleep/wake cycles. (Ding et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That directly recorded neural activity, logged during multiple sleep-wake cycles in mice, revealed that growth hormone was released in different ways during &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"&gt;REM (rapid eye movement) sleep&lt;/a&gt; and non-REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While growth hormone was increased in both phases, the neurons promoting and inhibiting its production shifted in terms of their influence. There was also a feedback loop involving neurons in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_coeruleus"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain linked to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that sleep and growth hormone form a tightly balanced system," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Daniel Silverman. "Too little sleep reduces growth hormone release, and too much growth hormone can in turn push the brain toward wakefulness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep drives growth hormone release, and growth hormone feeds back to regulate wakefulness, and this balance is essential for growth, repair, and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides its main job – promoting growth – growth hormone manages how glucose and fat are processed in the body. Without the right amount of the hormone, through a lack of sleep, the risk of obesity, diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; can increase. That adds to the number of ways that the new discoveries could be linked to good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the locus coeruleus also plays a part in managing how alert the brain is while we're awake. It's possible that the mechanisms revealed here are affecting cognition &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/where-does-brain-fog-come-from-new-evidence-could-solve-the-mystery"&gt;during the day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot more research is needed to determine all this for sure, and while there's good reason to believe that human brains and mice brains operate in the same way in these areas, it still needs to be proven. Ultimately though, new treatments for poor sleep could follow, which is something so many of us &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;struggle with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the neural circuit for growth hormone release could eventually point toward new hormonal therapies to improve sleep quality or restore normal growth hormone balance," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Silverman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some experimental gene therapies where you target a specific cell type. This circuit could be a novel handle to try to dial back the excitability of the locus coeruleus, which hasn't been talked about before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.05.039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

For those in the aspirin group, there was a 7.7 percent chance of cancer coming back within the three years covered by the study. For &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;the placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, the chances were 14.1 to 16.8 percent, depending on the type of mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is a drug that is readily available globally and extremely inexpensive compared to many modern cancer drugs, which is very positive," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Karolinska Institute surgeon Anna Martling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg" alt="Cancer risk graph" class="wp-image-175096 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-548x415.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-600x454.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Aspirin was linked to a lower risk of recurring cancer. (Martling et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this trial and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-finds-regular-aspirin-use-lowers-overall-cancer-risk"&gt;earlier research&lt;/a&gt;, researchers suspect that aspirin fights cancer in three ways: it reduces inflammation, it restricts tumor growth, and it limits the function of the platelets (blood cells) that can be used as shields by cancer cells as tumors spread. &lt;span&gt;It's also thought that aspirin may disrupt the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PIK3 signaling pathway, which is hypothesized to help &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-are-big-differences-between-cancer-cells-grown-in-a-lab-and-cancer-cells-in-the-human-body"&gt;cancer tumors grow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could help determine exactly why aspirin appears to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Although we do not yet fully understand all the molecular links, the findings strongly support the biological rationale and suggest that the treatment may be particularly effective in genetically defined subgroups of patients," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Martling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With around 30 to 40 percent of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21834"&gt;2 million people diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with colorectal cancer every year experiencing a recurrence of the disease, a simple way to reduce risk could save a lot of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-dose aspirin has previously been linked to other health benefits, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;reduced chances&lt;/a&gt; of repeat heart attacks and strokes. At the same time, research has also highlighted associations between aspirin and an elevated risk of other health problems, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-the-dangers-outweigh-the-benefits-when-it-comes-to-a-daily-aspirin"&gt;including internal bleeding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that cancers are already screened for critical mutations, which in this study accounted for a little over 1 in 3 &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/what-is-colorectal-cancer.html"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt; – a substantial number of cases that could potentially be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is being tested here in a completely new context as a precision medicine treatment," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Martling. "This is a clear example of how we can use genetic information to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Every three seconds, somewhere in the world, someone is diagnosed with dementia, and it's usually Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, approximately &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;50 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have AD. By 2050, this number will exceed 130 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human health and socioeconomic consequences of this are going to be immense. But perhaps it doesn't have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 report from the influential Lancet Commission suggests that up to one-third of AD cases &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-020-00646-x"&gt;could be prevented simply by avoiding certain risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-alzheimers-day-heres-how-far-weve-come-in-search-of-a-cure"&gt;World Alzheimer's Day: Here's How Far We've Come in Search of a Cure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;14 modifiable risk factors&lt;/a&gt; encompass: traumatic brain injury, hypertension,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, low physical activity levels, too much alcohol consumption, too little education, vision loss, hearing loss, social isolation, and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this comprehensive list is rooted soundly in science, it's not easy for members of the general public to monitor and manage 14 separate health targets – especially when prevention efforts need to start decades before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a problem that needs addressing. Tackling this problem requires a prevention model that is simple and memorable – something the public can easily embrace, understand, and follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are successful examples that can serve as a template. Stroke prevention associations, for instance, have successfully adopted the &lt;a href="https://www.heartandstroke.ca/stroke/signs-of-stroke"&gt;FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) mnemonic&lt;/a&gt; to teach stroke warning signs. AD prevention needs a FAST equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIELD (Sleep, Head Injury prevention, Exercise, Learning, and Diet) may fill that role. SHIELD brings together the most significant, overlapping dementia risk factors into five core pillars, offering a clear and effective strategy for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a foundational element of SHIELD. Maintaining healthy sleep habits is a key protective factor against dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;Adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; supports &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-023-02229-9"&gt;brain function, memory, mood, and learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insufficient (less than five hours per night) or poor-quality sleep (frequent awakenings), especially in midlife, increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Chronic poor sleep leads to a build-up in the brain of amyloid-beta protein, which is implicated in the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/IJG.0000000000001169"&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; also increases the likelihood of obesity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.20513"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and depression, all risk factors for AD. If you're currently sleeping four to five hours per night, consider changing this habit to avoid increasing your risk for developing dementia in later life. Sleep is a vital tool for brain protection and AD prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Head injury&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention is, rather surprisingly, often overlooked in conversations about dementia. There are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200662"&gt;strong links between traumatic brain injuries&lt;/a&gt;, including concussions, and higher AD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such head injuries can occur in a wide variety of settings, not just professional sports. Intimate partner violence, for example, is unfortunately common in our society and is a frequent, but neglected, cause of head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention should start early and continue throughout life, as damage can accumulate over time. Broader safety measures (such as improved helmet designs, stronger concussion protocols in youth and adult sports, and efforts to prevent head injuries in all settings) can play a significant role in protecting long-term brain health and avoiding AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A woman with grey hair using exercise equipment." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-working-out-in-a-gym-dHHcDjMcN_I"&gt;Unsplash/Centre for Ageing Better&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is perhaps the most powerful lifestyle habit for reducing the risk of AD. Exercise directly addresses multiple major risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and depression. It also supports the growth of brain cells, memory and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, physical inactivity remains common, especially in high-income countries, where it &lt;a href="https://barlowbooks.com/our-books/save-your-mind/"&gt;may contribute to as many as one in five AD cases&lt;/a&gt;. Exercise is not just "heart medicine," but "brain medicine" too. Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging and can help avoid AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning, both in and out of school, remains one of the strongest protective factors against dementia. Lower educational levels, such as not finishing secondary school, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70072-2"&gt;linked to a significantly increased risk for dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning contributes to the brain's "cognitive reserve," which is the brain's ability to function well despite damage or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with AD &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-139-5_Part_2-200309021-00014"&gt;maintained better mental function&lt;/a&gt; if they had continued learning throughout life. Public health messaging should promote life-long learning in all forms – from reading and language learning to engaging hobbies that keep the brain active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's never too early (or too late) to learn another language or to challenge your brain. Boosting your cognitive reserve boosts your brain against AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet also plays a major role in brain health and dementia prevention. No single food prevents dementia. Rather, a combination of nutrient-rich foods supports overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;A healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; can lower dementia risk by emphasizing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish, while restricting processed foods, red meat, and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to dietary patterns like the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu5114566"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; has shown promising results in protecting against cognitive decline. The Mediterranean diet is a brain/heart-healthy eating style inspired by the traditional diets of people in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emphasizes plant-based foods with olive oil as the primary fat source, while limiting red meat, processed foods, and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg" alt="foods in the mediterranean diet" class="wp-image-175110 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Mediterranean diet has been linked with a decrease in Alzheimer's disease.

A healthy diet shouldn't feel restrictive or like a punishment for trying to improve brain health. Instead, it can be framed as a positive investment in long-term independence, clarity, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simplifying the science, the SHIELD framework offers a realistic and research-backed approach to brain health. Until a cure is discovered, prevention is the strongest tool. Concepts like SHIELD provide a starting point for achievable prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease should not be seen as inevitable. The statistic that there will be more than 130 million people with AD by 2050 must not be accepted as predestined. With the right decisions and actions, we can work towards AD prevention by protecting the minds and memories of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Twiss, a fourth-year undergraduate student in Life Sciences at Queen's University, co-authored this story.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265053/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the team is planning to test the vaccine in women with recurrent yeast infections, also known as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). It's thought to affect one in 10 women in their lifetime and cause at least three or more yeast infections every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, treatment relies on just one class of drug, which increases the risk that the infection will develop resistance and be harder to treat. These drugs also cannot be used during pregnancy and do not prevent future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Karen Norris, lead study author and professor of immunology and translational biomedicine in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine, said: 'RVVC is not life-threatening, but it is miserable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a huge need.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris noted that the findings of these clinical trials could inform future research relating to more vulnerable populations, such as transplant recipients and cancer patients, who are at risk of life-threatening fungi that cause pneumonia, sepsis and infections in the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris said: 'I’ve had a physician say to me, "I have patients that I get through stem cell transplants for their cancer treatment, and then they get [the fungus] aspergillosis. I often don’t have adequate treatment for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's where I believe this vaccine will do the most good: in people who are at high risk for highly dangerous, life-threatening infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's research, published in June in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01171-4.epdf?sharing_token=eSFdZiSvMMMpOoBogqwI7NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PTjK0U_xzcb8G2-906pF8em6Zq3uUl41a9tMp_PWoQEzy4bK30EZIh5Ne-NgXScB49oHaqGwOPHN9yZL4Uva_XvYG_sII9mtaf8eMv0Iv_vJcHiW1e0quRQNONCkKbZBI%3D"&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, tested the NXT-2 vaccine on female mice that had been infected with vulvovaginal candidiasis, or a vaginal yeast infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine works by triggering the production of antibodies that work against NXT-2, a protein that helps export RNA and proteins.

They found the DNA of the bacteria Viridians streptococcal, which lives in the mouth and digestive tract, in more than 40 percent of plaque samples from both groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15110035/pancreatic-cancer-oral-bacteria-gum-disease.html"&gt;Naturally found in the mouths of most Americans&lt;/a&gt;, Viridians streptococcal bacteria is usually harmless in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the participants, the bacteria was largely present as a biofilm, or community of organisms, embedded into the arterial walls, where it lays dormant and evades detection from the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in people who are immunocompromised or have chronic conditions, the organisms may escape the biofilm and lead to conditions like endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart that causes inflammation, damage to heart tissue and blockages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When infected tissue breaks off from a heart valve, it travels through the bloodstream and can lodge itself into the coronary artery, blocking blood flow and eventually leading to a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the results, experts are urging Americans to maintain proper oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing teeth twice a day and staying current on dental check ups to reduce the amount of Viridians streptococcal in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Finland found a common bacteria found in the mouth could be linked to America's biggest killer, heart disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pekka J Karhunen, study author and professor in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology at Tampere University in Finland, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/heart-attacks-may-be-linked-to-bacterial-infections-study-finds#How-would-oral-bacteria-cause-a-heart-attack"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'We aim to show that there is a biofilm consisting of many bacteria in the atherosclerotic plaques and we also study the possibility that calcification of the biofilm — which occurs in the surface of the teeth — might also be involved in the calcification of coronary arteries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as nearly one in three Americans, 83million, have some form of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health authorities expect by 2050, more than 60 percent of Americans will have some form of heart disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease accounts for one in three - 1million - deaths in the US, making it the leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published last month in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521#sec-1"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, looked at coronary plaque samples from 121 people who suffered a sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 63, and nearly three in four were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group also had an average body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating obesity, one of the leading causes of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also looked at an additional 96 people who had undergone an endarterectomy, a surgery to remove plaque from the inner lining of an artery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age in this group was 69, and 72 percent were men. Their average BMI was 27, indicating they were overweight but not obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found 66 percent of plaque samples from the deceased group contained bacteria and 58 percent from the surgery group had it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the most common bacteria in both groups was oral viridans group streptococci (Viridians streptococcal). It was found in 42 percent of deceased patients and 43 percent of those who had surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In normal, unclogged arteries, there was less bacteria.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karhunen said: 'Oral viridans group Streptococci are known to act as early colonizers in the buildup of the dental biofilm known as dental plaque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This signals that the streptococci may not be there alone - it is possible that there is a biofilm composed of many bacteria.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted that while in the biofilm, bacteria 'are safe inside the jelly-like cover and they do not cause any harm to the individual.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he said the 'situation changes dramatically' when the biofilm is activated through an infection or other cause, resulting in the bacteria spreading to the plaque and causing inflammation and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burke went into cardiac arrest at 21 years old while cheering at the University of Houston due to an undiagnosed congenital heart defect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matias Escobar, pictured here in the middle, nearly died while competing in the New York City Triathlon in 2023 at age 38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria may then lead to endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart and its valves, which strikes between 10,000 and 30,000 Americans every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition causes irregular growths made of germs and cell pieces to form clumps in the heart called vegetations, which can break loose and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys or arteries, triggering heart failure, stroke, heart attack and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned that the findings are not definitive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they noted they are studying 'the possibility of developing a vaccine against the formation of a biofilm and bacterial-induced thrombosis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Klodas, chief medical officer and founder  of Step One Foods, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a67948713/heart-attack-linked-to-bacterial-infection-study/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Prevention the study findings are a reminder that 'our various bodily systems are interconnected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Getting regular dental check-ups and brushing our teeth and flossing is not only good for our mouths, but also for our hearts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 01:49:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>告诉《华盛顿邮报》：特朗普和小RFK的自闭症计划对您有何影响？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/22/submissions-autism/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SXHQNQPC5ZAWDFJ2HMFS2GU6QI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Trump administration has made finding answers on autism a top priority, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAMPA, Idaho — &lt;span&gt;Officials have identified an invasive species of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Nampa. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A single Aedes aegypti, also known as the yellow fever or Egyptian mosquito, was recovered by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/2cmad/posts/pfbid02CwbCQrsLr8eugGf5SAgoWZXhy4eu7TYGaaXjHx8rAGJAyDqjrpiqxEga638qE4jdl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; on Aug. 11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district first visually identified the species, then sent it in for DNA testing in order to confirm. A positive result confirmed the sample as Aedes aegypti on Sept. 17, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District Director Jim Lunders said this was the first known detection of the species in Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mosquitoes are native to Africa and can transmit over 50 different diseases, including Zika and dengue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No additional mosquitos of this kind were found in the surrounding areas, according to the Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District, although officials will continue to monitor through 2026. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of Ae. aegypti establishing reminds us of the importance of the public taking an active role in minimizing potential habitats around their home," Lunders said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mosquitoes bite at all times of day and breed in standing water. In order to protect against mosquitoes, people should monitor spaces like flower pots, birdbaths, unused pools and hot tubs, clogged gutters and old tires. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canyon County residents who are experiencing mosquito problems can report them &lt;a href="https://www.2cmad.org/request/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 208-461-8633.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

controversial policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Monarez’s departure sparked a mass exodus at the top of the agency, with Jernigan, Daskalakis, and Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry also leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Speaking on a Zoom call on Monday, the trio said last week’s vaccine panel meeting—in which the group admitted they were “rookies”—confirmed their fears about how vaccine policy is being shaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The people deciding vaccine policy for the United States should not be rookies. That was beyond disappointing and disheartening,” said Houry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Daskalakis agreed. “Over 60 percent reduction in flu samples means that we don’t know what the next pandemic strain is going to be. We’re not going to be able to develop vaccines to be ready for seasonal flu or pandemic flu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The chaos at the CDC has led to calls for Kennedy to resign.

It’s safe to take them together, so it’s not a risk, but it is an unwise use of your dollars,” says integrative medicine doctor &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-lamees-hamdan-838232b0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wishinguwellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a pharmacist and functional genomics practitioner at The DNA Company, agrees. “Calcium and magnesium use the same absorption pathways in your intestines.

This, she says, can lead to unpredictable absorption of one or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Dr. Hamdan, &lt;a href="https://cassioburycourt.com/clinical-reviewer/dr-olalekan-otulana-advanced-practitioner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a general physician at Cassiobury Court, says that taking magnesium and calcium supplements together isn’t necessarily dangerous, but he adds that what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dangerous is someone not getting enough of these two crucial nutrients, which they may be relying on the supplements for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking magnesium and calcium together, all of the experts recommend spacing them out. Dr. Otulana suggests taking the calcium supplement in the morning because some people find it energizing and taking the magnesium supplement at night because it can have a relaxing effect and support sleep. If you’re a coffee drinker, another reason to take magnesium at night is because coffee can block the absorption of it, according to Dr. Hamden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/703659/lisamulcahy/8-things-you-didnt-know-about-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Facts You Didn't Know About Supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 Facts You Didn't Know About Supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One Other Supplement Stack Doctors Say To Avoid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides calcium and magnesium, Dr. Otulana says that iron and zinc supplements should not be taken at the same time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Iron and zinc also compete for absorption in the digestive tract. If you take them together, particularly at high doses, they can interfere with how much of each your body absorbs. This is especially important if you’re taking them to treat a deficiency because you want to make sure your body actually gets the dose it needs,” he shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lcmchealth.org/east-jefferson-general-hospital/about-us/education/family-medicine-residency/meet-our-faculty-and-residents/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a resident physician at East Jefferson General Hospital LCMC Health, says that it’s especially not a good idea to take iron and zinc together on an empty stomach. Instead, he recommends taking them separately, both with food. “Food helps reduce competition between the minerals, allowing your body to absorb them more efficiently,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-choose-safe-supplements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Study Found That 90% of Melatonin Supplements Are Mislabeled—Here Are the Safest Supplement Brands to Try;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A Study Found That 90% of Melatonin Supplements Are Mislabeled—Here Are the Safest Supplement Brands to Try&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Otulana adds that vitamin C helps with iron absorption, so it’s an especially good idea to take iron supplements with foods like citrus fruits, cantaloupe, bell peppers, broccoli or Brussels sprouts, which all contain vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to taking supplements, Dr. Hamden says that it’s a misconception that the bigger the dose, the bigger the benefit; she emphasizes that this is not true. “Each supplement has a dosage that works the best, so more doesn't mean that it works better. Formulating supplements really is an art because many of them work better together. When stacking them, you need to lower the dosage of each individual one because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vu adds to this, saying it’s always a good idea to talk to your primary care physician before starting or changing a supplement routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to knock back all your supplements at once, but the safest and most effective way is to talk to your doctor about timing, including what can be taken together and what can’t. That way, you’ll get the maximum benefit possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/living/women-over-50-sunscreen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: The One Thing Women Over 50 Don't Realize About SPF, According to a Pro Makeup Artist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: The One Thing Women Over 50 Don't Realize About SPF, According to a Pro Makeup Artist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-lamees-hamdan-838232b0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, integrative medicine doctor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cassioburycourt.com/clinical-reviewer/dr-olalekan-otulana-advanced-practitioner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,&lt;/a&gt; general physician at Cassiobury Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lcmchealth.org/east-jefferson-general-hospital/about-us/education/family-medicine-residency/meet-our-faculty-and-residents/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH, &lt;/a&gt;resident physician at East Jefferson General Hospital LCMC Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wishinguwellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;pharmacist and functional genomics practitioner at The DNA Company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/supplements-to-never-take-together" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Sep 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

              &lt;p&gt;Under our current age of Trump, it’s frankly stranger when the federal government doesn’t do something completely unproductive. The latest bit of pointlessness? The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has switched back to using the name “monkeypox”—an outdated label for the disease mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NPR was the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/12/g-s1-88287/mpox-monkeypox-virus-stigma"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; on the name switchback, which appears to have been implemented sometime in the last month. Nearly three years ago, virologists pushed for monkeypox to be retired, both for being potentially stigmatizing and factually inaccurate, since monkeys aren’t the primary hosts of the virus in the wild. HHS confirmed the switch to Gizmodo but offered no elaboration as to why it did so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why the change?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November 2022, the World Health Organization officially &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/monkeypox-new-name-mpox-1849826028"&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; the label “mpox” to describe the viral disease, following a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/monkeypox-new-name-mpox-1849826028"&gt;concerted effort&lt;/a&gt; by relevant experts and scientists to retire “monkeypox.” This name was quickly reaffirmed by many health organizations and countries, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasoning was twofold. One, though humans first discovered monkeypox in a group of lab monkeys in the 1950s, we now know that rodents are its predominant animal hosts. Since 2022, the disease has also spread widely between people, causing outbreaks across the globe—another sign of monkeypox’s outdatedness. Though outbreaks have generally lessened in most parts of the world, the disease still causes &lt;a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/"&gt;large surges of illness&lt;/a&gt; to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Secondly, many scientists &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/metaphors-matter-why-changing-the-name-monkeypox-may-help-curb-the-discriminatory-language-used-to-discuss-it-185343"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; the harmful racial and ethnic connotations of the name. People have long used “monkey” as a racist shorthand for Black or African people, and some have cast monkeypox as strictly an “African” disease (mpox is still most prevalent in parts of Africa, but the global outbreak has clearly illustrated that it doesn’t respect borders).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Boghuma Titanji, a virus researcher at Emory University originally from Cameroon, recounted to NPR how her attempts to share information about the mpox outbreaks in 2022 quickly led to a pile-on from racist trolls on social media. “Likening me to a monkey, asking me to go back to Africa, where people have sex with monkeys, and being someone who defends gay sex with monkeys. Those were some of the really, really dark messages that I got in my inbox,” she told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What’s in a name?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, admittedly, some room for confusion here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, different organizations are responsible for naming a virus as opposed to the disease it causes. And while most experts and health agencies defer to the WHO’s guidance for a disease’s name, it’s the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) that decides the formal name of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right around the same time that WHO was considering a name change, the ICTV stated that it would not drastically change its labeling of the virus behind mpox. Though the group has been updating its classification of many virus groups lately, it ultimately only added a &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/orthopoxvirus"&gt;broader label&lt;/a&gt; in front to illustrate its closeness to other similar pox viruses. So its official species name is now &lt;i&gt;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox &lt;/i&gt;(if it’s any consolation, many scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/silly-and-pompous-official-new-names-viruses-rile-researchers"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; about the ICTV’s virus name updating for other reasons).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s this distinction that HHS may be hanging its hat on in order to support the name switch. An HHS spokesperson told Gizmodo, “Monkeypox is the name of the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, though, that’s not accurate. Or at least, monkeypox isn’t the name that most every other health agency around the world now uses for the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus; that’s mpox. That long list also currently includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the agency (part of HHS) is still using mpox on its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/about/index.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; about the disease. Since the last update of that page occurred in April 2025, though, it’s probably only a matter of time before that changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As for why the federal government is doing this, who honestly knows? Trump and other members of his administration have made it clear that they despise the WHO, to the point of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-trumps-decision-to-leave-the-who-is-a-catastrophe-in-the-making-2000552752"&gt;stripping away the funding&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. has historically provided to the agency. But that doesn’t really explain why the change is happening now. For all we know, someone got in Trump’s or Health Secretary RFK Jr.’s ear last month and scared them into thinking “mpox” is too woke a term for the U.S. to endorse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we can say for sure is how utterly pointless any of this is.&lt;/p&gt;

These effects peak four hours after consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were keen to discover how this combination of factors affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting 20 men between the ages of 18 and 35 and 21 men between 60 and 80, researchers measured the effectiveness of blood vessels linked to heart and brain health before and after consuming a milkshake dubbed the “brain bomb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The milkshake participants consumed was called a “brain bomb” because the primary ingredient was heavy whipping cream. rawpixel.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decadent shake clocked in at 1,362 calories and 130 grams of fat, as the primary ingredient was heavy whipping cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings confirmed previous research that has shown that a high-fat meal impairs the ability of the blood vessels linked to heart health to open in both young and old participants,” Marley and Bailey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These impairments reduced the brain’s ability to buffer changes in blood pressure,” they added. “This was more pronounced (by about 10%) in the older adults, suggesting that older brains may be more vulnerable to the effects of the meal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair noted that &lt;a href="https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/131/23/2807/71652/Post-prandial-hyperlipidaemia-results-in-systemic?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that meals high in saturated fat increase cell-damaging free radicals while decreasing nitric oxide, which helps relax blood vessels and supports the transport of oxygen and glucose throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; limiting saturated fat to less than 6% of total daily calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting saturated fat to less than 6% of total daily calories. adimas – stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who eats 2,000 calories a day, that means no more than 120 calories — or roughly 13 grams — should come from saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That limit is easy to exceed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers found that zeaxanthin, long associated with eye health, may also boost the body’s immune response against cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_7b1595855b85627e26ccff3575b6e1d0" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that zeaxanthin, a carotenoid derived from plants and traditionally recognized for supporting eye health, may also enhance immune function by boosting the tumor-fighting abilities of certain immune cells. Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_5320548253fb53903fe4d0f8f1485d98" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the research points to zeaxanthin’s promise as an accessible supplement that could improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that zeaxanthin, already known for its role in eye health, has a completely new function in boosting anti-tumor immunity,” said Jing Chen, PhD, Janet Davison Rowley Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine and senior author of the study. “Our study shows that a simple dietary nutrient could complement and strengthen advanced cancer treatments like immunotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does this nutrient work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen’s laboratory has spent years investigating how nutrients shape immune function, and this study extends that effort. By screening an extensive library of blood nutrients, the team pinpointed zeaxanthin as a compound that directly boosts the activity of CD8+ T cells, the immune cells responsible for killing tumor cells. These T cells depend on a structure known as the T-cell receptor (TCR) to detect and eliminate abnormal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that zeaxanthin helps stabilize and reinforce the TCR complex on CD8+ T cells when they engage with cancer cells. This strengthening effect amplifies intracellular signaling, leading to greater T-cell activation, higher cytokine production, and improved tumor-killing performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Zeaxanthin improves immunotherapy effects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse experiments, dietary zeaxanthin supplementation slowed the progression of tumors. Even more striking, when paired with immune checkpoint inhibitors—a widely used form of cancer immunotherapy—zeaxanthin markedly increased anti-tumor activity compared to immunotherapy on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the findings, the researchers tested human T cells engineered to recognize specific tumor antigens and found that zeaxanthin treatment improved these cells’ ability to kill melanoma, multiple myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in laboratory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our data show that zeaxanthin improves both natural and engineered T-cell responses, which suggests high translational potential for patients undergoing immunotherapies,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A safe and accessible candidate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeaxanthin is sold as an over-the-counter supplement for eye health, and is naturally found in vegetables like orange peppers, spinach, and kale. It’s inexpensive, widely available, well-tolerated and, most importantly, its safety profile is known – which means it can be safely tested as an adjunct to cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also reinforces the importance of a balanced diet. In their previous research, Chen’s group discovered that &lt;a href="https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/news/tva-nutrient-cancer-immunity"&gt;trans-vaccenic &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_9745a074b5eb990461959ea2eda628f3" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt; (TVA), a fatty acid derived from dairy and meat&lt;/a&gt;, also boosts T-cell activity – but through a different mechanism. Together, the findings suggest that nutrients from both plant and animal sources may provide complementary benefits to immune health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clinical applications of zeaxanthin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the researchers emphasize that the work is still at an early stage. Most of the findings come from laboratory experiments and animal studies. Thus, clinical trials will be needed to determine whether zeaxanthin supplements can improve outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open a new field of nutritional immunology that looks at how specific dietary components interact with the immune system at the molecular level,” Chen said. “With more research, we may discover natural compounds that make today’s cancer therapies more effective and accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating breakfast earlier may be a simple, daily habit that supports better health and a longer life as we age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found that later breakfasts were linked to depression, fatigue, poor sleep, and a higher risk of death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study highlights “chrononutrition,” showing that when we eat, not just what we eat, impacts healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s often said that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/creative-breakfast-recipes-8777001" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is the most important meal of the day, and a new study from &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Massachusetts General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes the adage. It also indicates an easy change that older adults can make that might boost their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/healthy-aging-guide-7571546" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;health and longevity&lt;/a&gt;. As we get older, what and how we eat tends to change, but until this study, less has been known about how meal timing impacts our health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Published in Communications Medicine, the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01035-x" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; examined key aspects of meal timing that are significant for aging populations to determine whether certain patterns might signal, or even influence, health outcomes later in life. The research team analyzed data, including blood samples, from 2,945 adults, aged 42 to 94 years old, living in a community in the UK. The study group was followed for more than 20 years. They found that as the older adults aged, they tended to eat breakfast and dinner at later times, while also narrowing the overall time window in which they ate each day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-impact-of-later-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Impact of Later Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it might not sound problematic, having a later breakfast time was consistently associated with having physical and mental health conditions, including depression, fatigue, and oral health problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond that, the study also noted difficulty with meal preparation and worse sleep were also linked with later mealtimes. Most notably, later breakfast timing was associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up. The researchers adjusted for age in their statistical models—so they weren’t simply comparing older vs. younger participants. Even with these adjustments, they still found that later breakfast timing (specifically) was linked to a higher risk of multimorbidity and mortality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lead researcher Hassan Dashti, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, explained that the study provides missing information about how the timing of meals evolves in later life and how the shift impacts overall health and longevity. He notes that later meal timing, particularly eating breakfast later, is associated with both health challenges and increased mortality in older adults.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research on healthy eating has often focused on what should be eaten; this study underlines the importance of chrononutrition, the study of the timing of eating, as a modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes. Notably, that meal timing, especially breakfast, could serve as a simple marker of health in older adults and may guide future strategies for healthy aging. It is something that patients and their doctors can be aware of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status," says Dashti. Also, encouraging older adults to have consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promote healthy aging and longevity, he adds.

Out of a sample of 149 people, about half of whom had been diagnosed with autism, his test correctly identified more than 97% of the autistic people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, a similar study conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital started with 416 people who were known to be autistic or not. The blood test appeared to be 85% accurate, but the scientists said they needed more samples. They are now following infants who were identified by the blood test to see how reliably it predicts autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn subsequently looked for fecal abnormalities in people with autism.

Due to that, he is now looking into the possibility that autism could be cured or its symptoms reduced by changing autistic children’s gut microbiota, such as bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his paper, he acknowledged that dietary differences and small sample sizes could account for the differences found in his and other similar studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn, through RPI, defended the research he plans to do as part of the newly announced CDC contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the question is worth investigating, even if the study only serves to replicate the results of previous studies — all of which found no connection between vaccinations and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Professor Hahn believes that science is an ongoing process of discovery and that, as with a large Danish autism study released earlier this year, it can be helpful to revisit complex questions using new datasets in order to deepen our understanding of previous findings,” an RPI spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish study of more than 1 million people, published in July in the Annals of Internal Medicine, looked at whether the aluminum in vaccines could lead to autism, allergies, asthma and about 50 other chronic conditions.

Scientific consensus is clear, and further studies are not warranted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of providing certainty, Dr. Juergen Hahn’s proposed work will provide legitimacy to vaccine skeptics by suggesting that a causal link between vaccination and autism is even conceivable,” Trujillo wrote to the board of trustees. “Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise globally, in part driven by perceived risk of vaccination. In contributing to this hesitancy, (RPI) will be complicit in decreasing vaccination rates, a return of once-defeated diseases like measles, and ultimately, unnecessary suffering and early deaths. I urge the institute to reconsider their CDC contract, for the good of humanity and their own reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is having its own difficulties right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-5" data-large-id="Inline-7" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices took a vote and then the next day reversed it regarding the shot known as the MMRV — measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (which is called varicella). The panel first decided the MMRV &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccines-acip-hepatitis-b-chickenpox-21623ff8ead38ae1b21db488ee82a1f8" data-link="native" class=""&gt;should not be given to children under the age of 4&lt;/a&gt;, because some young children have febrile seizures after the shot. Febrile seizures aren’t dangerous — they don’t cause brain damage, for example — but they can be terrifying for the caregivers, panel members noted. But they voted to allow the Vaccines for Children program to cover the cost of that vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the next day, the panel decided not to allow the Vaccines for Children program to pay for the MMRV shot. Panel members said &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/health/cdc-vaccines-mmrv-hepatitis-b.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;they were confused&lt;/a&gt; by the wording of the previous day’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the vaccine for chickenpox is administered in a separate shot from the vaccine, but at the same visit. But some doctors argued that the combined shot is easier because children only have to endure one needle instead of two. Doctors argued combined shots are especially important in areas where it’s hard to keep the children on the vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Past controversies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern controversy over vaccines and autism traces to a late-1990s study that has since been discredited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-6" data-large-id="Inline-8" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist in the UK &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2831678/#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%20published%20on,in%20lawsuits%20against%20vaccine%20manufacturers." data-link="native" class=""&gt;altered study results&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 to make it look like the popular vaccine for measles had caused autism. The scientist, Andrew Wakefield, was at the time trying to market his own version of the measles vaccine. He was exposed by a journalist and &lt;a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/autism_doctor#:~:text=After%20a%20lengthy%20investigation%2C%20England's,on%20children%20without%20official%20permission." data-link="native" class=""&gt;lost his medical license&lt;/a&gt;. The study was based on 12 children, some of whom actually did not have autism and some of whom had symptoms before vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea he proposed, that vaccines given in early childhood could cause autism, has never gone away. It has been studied repeatedly, with no connections found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is first given when children are around 12 to 15 months old. That’s around the same time that they start to speak. Some parents have described their children as losing skills in babbling, making eye contact and soothing themselves around that time, which leads to an association with the vaccine. That is now diagnosed as “regressive” autism, but doctors do not yet know what causes it; scientists have considered genetic and environmental factors. Statistically, the regression happens around 19 months, long after the vaccine is administered, but it can happen as early as 15 months, which is when the vaccine is often given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-7" data-large-id="Inline-9" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times Union</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOb2RVbXNNY29WOXdpb1RRU3pnTDZKTGtZVXgxMGQxZU1ZbjkySEIyb01XZXNmSlNwbWZ1eEhSZ01nMVFZNlRsaVJweXJ2OTFhRHVEcEIxTXZTQTlfSGVIcWJzeDlZWjJicGtmeU9Gb3pBXzBqQTBRek54VlNKQ2d6aWdsZjg3RjBfckZaWkdRVmlUQU9QWVZDanpn</guid></item><item><title>为什么女性要承受痴呆症的负担：解开性别差距- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-women-burden-dementia-unraveling-sex.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Research led by Dr. Farida Sohrabji, Regents Professor and director of the Women's Health in Neuroscience Program at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, observed that biological sex significantly increases the risk of stroke in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older women&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that accelerates the onset and progression of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In every decade after 50," explained Sohrabji, "women are more likely to experience stroke compared to men, especially severe strokes. This significantly fuels the risk for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; and eventual dementia, and is fundamental for future drug developments and personalized medicine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new approach to treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's findings support a growing body of research in precision medicine, an approach that tailors medical care to individual characteristics, such as biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Similar drugs don't always work as effectively or the same across sexes. Even though the disease or condition may be the same, the effect of treatments on male and female brains may not be," said Sohrabji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insight is urgent for Alzheimer's care, where women make up the majority of patients. For women 60 and over, the risk of developing Alzheimer's is almost twice as likely as the risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We already customize and personalize treatments for certain cancers," Sohrabji said. "It's fundamental that we do the same for stroke and dementia, and I believe it will lead to better outcomes overall."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's lab set out to understand why women are disproportionately affected by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key discovery points to hormonal changes during menopause. As estrogen levels drop, the brains of women become more vulnerable to inflammation, damage and ultimately stroke—known contributors to dementia and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found estrogen appears to protect against stroke," she said. "In fact, in models where ovaries are removed, stroke outcomes worsened, yet were reversed with estrogen treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is complex, and the relationship isn't straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We repeated the same study and used estrogen replacement to see if it would protect older female model populations. To our surprise, it did not," Sohrabji explained. "Estrogen was actually toxic. It made the loss of brain tissue more severe, impairment more severe and when we followed them long term, they showed signs of clear neurodegeneration."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The promise of sex-specific therapies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these complex results, Sohrabji and her team explored whether a small peptide called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), in combination with estrogen therapy, could improve outcomes for middle-aged female models, and their findings were groundbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the combination reverse the usually toxic effects of estrogen to this older group, but subsequent studies showed that IGF-1 treatment alone is sufficient to improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stroke/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you gave the subjects &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/estrogen/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; and IGF-1, you clearly see neuroprotective effects," Sohrabji said. "In fact, IGF-1 treatment itself was one of the most neuroprotective molecules we have ever tested."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other work, the researchers tested a small, non-coding RNA molecule, and again, the results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administering the agent both protected brain tissue and noticeably reduced long-term signs of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest the agent played a protective role in the process, and it was most effective in older female subjects compared to age-matched males," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sex differences matter in brain research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's research represents a shift from one-size-fits-all treatments to tailored therapies, adding to a growing call in neuroscience and medicine in recognizing the importance of sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These differences aren't minor, they're profound. It's why we see women bear the burden of chronic diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By advancing sex-specific research, Sohrabji is championing a promising future where the burden of Alzheimer's no longer falls hardest on women, and where therapies advance overall human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a basic scientist, and in my personal journeys, we follow our passions to improving human health and to solving these really important problems," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's research studies have been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/20/6852/tab-article-info" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159124005300?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.05.001" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Steves agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e94ae2" class="body-graf"&gt;“He called me two days later and said, ‘You’ve got a serious problem. You’ve got a PSA of 55 and you’ve got prostate cancer,’” Steves tells TODAY.com. “It was all hands on deck to change over to: How are we going to address that prostate?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-324a49" class="body-graf"&gt;Having a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/tests.html" target="_blank"&gt;PSA level over 10 increases&lt;/a&gt; one’s likelihood of having prostate cancer, says the American Cancer Society. Steves says he wants to share his story to increase awareness of PSA testing and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f91f8d" class="body-graf"&gt;“If I can help people be more mindful and smart with their health, especially as they get into the age that I’m at, that’s a beautiful thing to do with my celebrity,” he says. “Talk about it.

That’s really important so that people can be comfortable talking about something a lot of people think is private.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d635e3" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Feeling So Good’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8eb98" class="body-graf"&gt;Hearing the news in August 2024 was shocking to Steves because he felt healthy and had spoken to his doctor about how he could continue to travel and embrace life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94bf80" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was feeling so good. 69 years old, looking at 70, feeling great,” he says. “We were talking about wellness, and diet, and exercise and how to enjoy the next years and be really healthy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-76f5ea"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1850" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg" alt="After learning he had prostate cancer, travel writer Rick Steves opted for surgery to have his prostate removed.

And it did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-859b33" class="body-graf"&gt;“After three months, I was just fine,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-480df6" class="body-graf"&gt;Several months after surgery, Steves underwent another PSA test to see if doctors had removed all the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e5e08" class="body-graf"&gt;“The psychological thing for me was it was really strange to be in the waiting stage,” he says. “You’re helpless.

From 2014 through 2021, it increased by 3% every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7a6532" class="body-graf"&gt;Dahut says there’s multiple things driving this increase. One issue is that PSA screenings declined after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said the testing did “more harm than good,” in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f003d" class="body-graf"&gt;“There was a dramatic fall in men who had PSA testing,” Dahut says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-227340" class="body-graf"&gt;Six years later, that decision was revised and it's now recommended that men between 55 and 70 talk to their doctors about PSA testing, what’s known as informed decision making. Some men should undergo screening because of family history or past abnormal blood testing, while others might not need to check their PSA levels often. But this can be confusing. Today, the percentage of men undergoing PSA screening is low, Dahut adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38d3d9" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you look at the history of prostate cancer clinically, you know it can be indolent for years and years, then over time it can evolve to where the cancer is more aggressive and ultimately spread,” Dahut says. “It’s not surprising if screening went down and then over time you would see more men presenting with more advanced disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-129a54" class="body-graf"&gt;Dahut notes that other causes can play a role in increasing rates, such as environmental factors, diet and lack of exercise, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-061710" class="body-graf"&gt;Prostate cancer does not have any symptoms until later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe8f2a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Symptoms generally occur when the cancer has spread. If it has spread into the bladder, you might get blood in your urine,” Dahut says. “If it spreads to the bones or elsewhere, you have pain, or fatigue, or weight loss.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-653f85" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment for prostate cancer can include observation, a prostatectomy, radiation and testosterone blocking, also called hormone therapy. Some people diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer could only ever need observation, which has advanced as MRI technology has improved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a74a2" class="body-graf"&gt;“Some men’s cancer never progresses,” Dahut says. “Men sometimes will opt for treatment because there’s anxiety knowing that there’s a cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-897d7d" class="body-graf"&gt;With prostate cancer, there’s a strong “familial component,” which means knowing one’s family history can be important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f9a5b" class="body-graf"&gt;“People are probably not aware of the importance of family history and when one should be screened for prostate cancer,” Dahut says. “It’s not discussed that much. And if you have a strong family history of prostate cancer, you should probably begin discussing screening at age 40, for example.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d1b76d" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Be Open’ About Prostate Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01b4bc" class="body-graf"&gt;Since being diagnosed, Steves has met many cancer survivors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9a134" class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s astonishing to me or remarkable to me is how secretive it is — unless you’re a member, then people are forthcoming,” he says. “I had friends of mine and work colleagues (who) had prostate cancer, and I never knew.

They found that Streptococcus mutans, best known for causing cavities, can settle in the gut and release metabolites that reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These metabolites trigger neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and motor impairments resembling Parkinson’s. The findings suggest that targeting the oral–gut microbiome could lead to novel strategies for preventing or treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral–Gut–Brain Link:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt; can migrate from mouth to gut and affect the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic Metabolite:&lt;/strong&gt; Its metabolite ImP damages dopaminergic neurons and promotes Parkinson’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking mTORC1 signaling reduced neuroinflammation and motor symptoms in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;POSTECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is now one more reason to brush your teeth thoroughly every day.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have identified the mechanism by which metabolites produced by oral bacteria in the gut may trigger the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published online on September 5 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a major neurological disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement. It affects approximately 1-2% of the global population over the age of 65, making it one of the most common age-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous studies suggested that the gut microbiota of individuals with Parkinson’s differs from that of healthy individuals, the specific microbes and metabolites have remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found an increased abundance of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt;—a well-known oral bacterium that causes dental caries—in the gut microbiome of Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; produces the enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA) and its metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP), both of which were present at elevated levels in the gut and blood of patients. ImP appeared capable of entering systemic circulation, reaching the brain, and contributing to the loss of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers introduced &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; into the gut or engineered &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; to express UrdA. As a result, the mice showed elevated ImP levels in blood and brain tissue, along with the hallmark features of Parkinson’s symptoms: loss of dopaminergic neurons, heightened neuroinflammation, impaired motor function, and increased aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments demonstrated that these effects depend on the activation of the signaling protein complex mTORC1. Treating mice with an mTORC1 inhibitor significantly reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that targeting the oral–gut microbiome and its metabolites may offer new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson’s disease,” said Professor Ara Koh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It highlights the potential of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic strategy, offering a new direction for Parkinson’s treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the Samsung Research Funding &amp;amp; Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics, the Mid-Career Researcher Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Microbiome Core Research Support Center, and the Biomedical Technology Development Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinsons’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e3f1edbebcb8bfc8f8e7fbfcedebe0a6e9eba6e3fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yung-Eui Kang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://postech.ac.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;POSTECH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yung-Eui Kang – POSTECH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63473-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gut microbial production of imidazole propionate drives Parkinson’s pathologies&lt;/a&gt;” by Ara Koh et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut microbial production of imidazole propionate drives Parkinson’s pathologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the selective degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and aggregation of α-synuclein. Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiome in PD, with microbial metabolites proposed as potential pathological mediators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific microbes and metabolites involved, and whether gut-derived metabolites can reach the brain to directly induce neurodegeneration, remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that elevated levels of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt;) and its enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA), which produces imidazole propionate (ImP), in the gut microbiome of patients with PD, along with increased plasma ImP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonization of mice with &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; harboring UrdA or &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; expressing UrdA from &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; increases systemic and brain ImP levels, inducing PD-like symptoms including dopaminergic neuronal loss, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; exacerbates α-synuclein pathology in a mouse model. ImP administration alone recapitulates key PD features, supporting the UrdA–ImP axis as a microbial driver of PD pathology. Mechanistically, mTORC1 activation is crucial for both &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt;– and ImP-induced PD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings identify microbial ImP, produced via UrdA, as a direct pathological mediator of the gut-brain axis in PD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:21:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBZZ1ZwUWpCSVJ0QW0tRS1xRkw0Y3RzYV9PVW1qSGUyVk5WOUc5akctNVRGdGZPVFNHZkxLR2lLLVY3ZGtVRWR2ckEzNzBNQmc2MUFDWGRUVjROQVVlY1p5NXpNdVphVXJxNW85NkNwejI2WF9HQnJZ</guid></item><item><title>这个小工具能治愈我吵闹的打鼾吗？我丈夫希望如此-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/snorelab-snoring-solution-zeus-women-52cl8t05s</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I still find it hard to believe — and admit publicly — that most nights I inflict the most unladylike sounds on him, which range from resembling a faulty drill to a constipated warthog. But there’s no hiding from a surveillance app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To see just how bad things have been getting for my husband I downloaded SnoreLab, one of several free phone apps that tracks and (mortifyingly)&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; records your nocturnal noise levels. It showed that last Wednesday I snored for 49 per cent of the 7 hours 16 minutes I was asleep — half an hour of that “loudly”. On Thursday and Friday it was 20 per cent of the night, and on Saturday 35 per cent. Playing back the “audio evidence”, my phone broadcasts the regular growlings, bursting every so often into night-splitting harrumphs. Could that really be me? Often for two to three hours a night?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, help could now be at hand in the form of a wearable device called a Zeus, which has been 15 years in development by the respiration and sleep experts at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London. After three positive clinical trials, next month it will begin a £1.5 million trial across six NHS trusts, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. The aim is for it to be endorsed as an NHS treatment for snoring and the more serious condition of obstructive sleep apnoea, which is at present treated with a cumbersome mask you strap to your face each night called a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/cpap-sleep-disorder-device-cuts-risk-of-needing-ventilator-rd2fwgv9r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine&lt;/a&gt;. This new device promises to be a lot less intrusive but will it work for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/sleep-tech-health-fitness-trackers-qcmpnkvcc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gen Zzzs: Is ‘sleep tech’ really on a par with fitness trackers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;First, what exactly makes some 41 per cent of the UK adult population — and yes almost as many women as men, even if they are less likely to admit it — snore? Snoring happens when the muscles that support our tongue and throat relax when we are asleep, causing our upper airway to narrow, explains Professor Joerg Steier, who led the Zeus team and is a consultant in respiratory and sleep medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’. This narrowing makes the walls in our upper airway flutter or touch, causing a noise as air passes through with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt; “When we are awake the brain tells our muscles to keep that upper airway wide open, which is why we don’t snore in the day,” he says. “But in sleep, when we go into our ‘standby mode’, the activity that the brain uses to activate these muscles drops out and the walls are no longer supported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Contributing to the narrowing airway is the fact that our tongue tends to glide backwards as we relax and gets further pulled by gravity when we lie down, typically on our backs, which is the sleeping position most likely to result in snoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Loud snoring isn’t bad for us, Steier says, but if the walls touch enough that the airway closes, that becomes obstructive sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The air is blocked so you momentarily stop breathing, which then typically wakes you up,” Steier says. People with sleep apnoea will have their sleep broken many times a night — as many as 100 — which could lead to long-term health issues including chronic sleepiness, depression and cardiovascular health risks, according to Steier, who has spent the past 20 years researching treatments for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2023 Snoring and Sleep &lt;a href="https://sleepreviewmag.com/sleep-disorders/breathing-disorders/snoring/global-study-reveals-high-prevalence-snoring" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found that almost half of men and a third of women snore. A separate YouGov &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/2240-does-your-partner-snore" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; in the UK found that women admit to snoring much less than men. And it gets worse with age: 77 per cent of 55 to 64-year-olds reportedly snore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It’s also exacerbated by obesity and by the menopause, when women lose the elasticity in their muscles. Even &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/dr-mark-porter-why-your-snoring-could-be-a-wake-up-call-to-something-more-serious-8lj9wvxvq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;just one glass of wine over dinner adds to the problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Alcohol, even a small amount, makes us more relaxed and that means our muscles are more relaxed so the airway is more collapsible,” Steier says. “The amount of alcohol that would stop you driving a car is making it likely you start snoring.” This might explain why I was particularly noisy on Wednesday night, after going to a book launch, and on Saturday, after meeting friends in the pub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/luxury/article/most-effective-snoring-solutions-times-luxury-pkf2p6gsj" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most effective — and chic — snoring solutions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Until now the most common remedies are to try to lie on your side or front when you sleep, which helps to prevent the tongue shifting backwards, or to wear a mouthpiece that helps to keep the tongue forward. My desperate husband often nudges me in the night to turn over but if I do I sometimes even wake myself up with a great harrumph, I am not keen to wear a mouthpiece — my Invisalign night retainer is pain enough — let alone strap on a Darth Vaderish CPAP mask. Blowing pressurised room air into your upper airway to keep it open may be an effective treatment for sleep apnoea but 30 per cent of people who try the device get fed up with using it within a year, according to the Sleep Apnoea Trust (it estimates that as many as &lt;a href="https://sleep-apnoea-trust.org/research" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;eight million people&lt;/a&gt; in the UK may have the issue to some degree).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The medical team behind the new Zeus device — which has been developed in conjunction with an award-winning British biomedical engineering company, Morgan Innovation and Technology — hope snorers will find their invention unobtrusive enough to wear easily at night. It is shaped like a tiny boomerang and you attach it under your chin with a sticky pad before you go to sleep. It’s not the most glamorous of bedroom accessories but then there’s little glamour in turning into a warthog of a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Zeus works by using a mini Tens machine (short for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) to deliver small electrical impulses to stimulate the genioglossus muscle that holds the tongue in place, with the aim of keeping it toned. “The initial thought was that it doesn’t take a lot for the brain to keep the upper airway in shape when we’re awake but this tone falls away when we fall asleep,” Steier says. “So we thought if we could maintain that tone, we won’t even need a big contraction of the muscles. We just need enough to keep the upper airway in shape. And how do we do this? Could we use electrical stimulation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Tens machines are used to help relieve back pain, period and labour pain, and arthritis by stimulating targeted muscles to improve blood flow. In the Zeus, stimulation is directed under the jaw. It is also possible to stimulate the genioglossus muscle via an implant linked to the hyperglossal nerve but, Steier says, “We wanted to find a way to stimulate this muscle without the need for surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/struggling-with-snoring-blowing-through-a-conch-might-help-80t9gp626" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Struggling with snoring? Blowing through a conch might help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To operate it you adjust tiny knobs embedded in it until you can feel the vibrations but not to such an extent that they keep you awake. The device then waits 20 minutes for you to fall asleep before starting up. Until it is endorsed as a NHS medical treatment, it is on sale for £250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So did it help me? In truth my experience has not been the slam dunk my husband prayed for. On the first night, it fell off while I was asleep — it turns out that night cream will stop it sticking, which may be a deal breaker for a lot of women. Although according to Nigel Clarke, CEO of Morgan Innovation and Technology, in the long term electrical stimulation may help to tone the neck, which would be quite the bonus. On the second night I had higher hopes, drifting off to the feeling of tiny buzzes in my jaw. However, I woke to find that my SnoreLab score was still terrible — I’d snored for an hour and a half, 20 minutes of that loudly. “Like a drunken sergeant,” as my husband put it. Oh, the mortification. And how disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the three clinical trials during its development, 60 per cent of a total of 109 patients found that the technology lowered their sleep apnoea. Meanwhile, in an additional 2022 trial with 17 patients, conducted by the sleep charity Hope2Sleep, 82 per cent said that it helped them to reduce their snoring. And in a 2024 clinical trial on 48 sleep apnoea patients in a Dorset County Hospital NHS Trust, 84 per cent reported better quality of sleep. So far 1,500 devices have been sold worldwide, with fewer than 5 per cent being returned under a money back guarantee, Clarke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Allie Hare, consultant in sleep medicine at the Royal Brompton Hospital and co-founder of the specialist Grace Sleep clinic, also believes the device “is a helpful addition to the treatment options for snoring and milder forms of sleep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/snoring-problem-marriage-experience-first-person-hjw37lf23" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;OK, I admit it — I’m a snorer. It’s my dirty (noisy) bedtime secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So was I doing something wrong? Steier says that the device works best if the reason you snore is that your tongue is moving backwards and blocking your airway. But if it’s being blocked by other issues, such as the vertical walls losing their tone, then pulling the tongue back may not make a difference. Maybe I am one of those cases. Or was it simply operator error?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For the subsequent four trial nights, I stuck it a bit further under my chin and it certainly seemed to work better — my snore scores for those nights were significantly lower. One morning my husband said he thought I’d left to sleep in another room as our bedroom was so uncharacteristically quiet. It’s not perfect but, while my SnoreLab app has replayed some continued grumblings, it’s now more creaky door than full warthog. I think we’d take that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And despite the way it looks, it is fairly easy to get used to wearing it once you’ve faffed about with sticky pads and remembered to charge it every day, so I’m prepared to persevere. After all, research by Zeus suggests that in snoring households, 28 per cent of partners end up sleeping in separate rooms. We’re not at that stage yet. The Zeus may look like a passion killer but if my husband can have his nights back, I’m sure we can work around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;a href="http://zeussleeps.com/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;zeussleeps.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPOTJCT20tVGl2blFPcmt0LWFqS1htT1FUbm5LRTRUSmhPOWdUcjlRS0lUTEpfeWNYc053ZU5PVUpaa2c2a05CNHBGbG9kLUlzVGxJZ3BJdFQzZ0g4VE9PSVRWVDBMTThkOUZOOWFwTlMxNTZBMDRIVjZkaWd1bDMwNmF0VThtQS02dWhMQnJSVVRDaDNlTmR4dWY3NVgweWlhcm9LMDF2b0U</guid></item><item><title>一次血液测试可以测量我们身体不同部位的衰老情况- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-blood-bodies-aging.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies do not age at a uniform rate. The speed at which one organ ages can differ greatly from another due to a range of lifestyle, environmental and genetic factors. Conventional tests provide a single number for overall biological age, but they do not indicate which parts of the body are aging the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have developed a single blood test that can measure the aging of 11 different physiological systems, offering a more detailed and personalized look at how our bodies are changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have relied on epigenetic clocks, which use DNA changes in the blood to estimate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;. They can give more insights than chronological age but are still not very precise. In a paper &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00958-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/i&gt;, scientists describe how they set out to develop a new test for the aging status of different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A more precise look at biological aging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team collected vast amounts of health data, including medical histories, blood tests, grip strength and other physical measurements, from about 7,500 people. They looked for clear links between blood-based biomarkers, such as cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and age-related conditions in several organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the team used machine learning to connect these findings with DNA methylation patterns from a single blood sample. DNA methylation is the process by which DNA adds or removes chemical tags that switch genes on and off, and which change over time. By training a computer to recognize these patterns, scientists created the Systems Age test, which can calculate a unique score for the biological age of 11 physiological systems. These include the heart, lung, brain, metabolic and immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;After training their model, the researchers tested it on blood samples of more than 8,000 people. They found that it was better at predicting specific diseases and aging-related conditions than the single-number biological age scores from older epigenetic clocks. For example, the test's heart score was a stronger predictor of heart disease than a standard biological age test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that individuals with the same overall Systems Age could have very different patterns of aging across their physiological systems. Knowing this could help doctors provide more targeted treatments to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By providing system-specific scores, Systems Age may better pinpoint which age-related conditions individuals are at risk for," wrote Morgan Levine, one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; is aging faster than your lungs or heart, your doctor might recommend specific strategies to boost your immunity. Or if your heart score is high, a doctor could suggest lifestyle changes or medications to target cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

Many people don’t realize that the way they sit, or even where they place their arm, can lead to a falsely high reading. That’s the takeaway from a recent study referenced by cardiologist Dr. Evan Levine in an Instagram post, which shows how arm position during a blood pressure test can lead to unnecessary concern, and in some cases, overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study: How arm position changes readings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in JAMA in October 2024, the study looked at 133 adults with an average age of 57. Each participant’s blood pressure was measured in three different positions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;resting their arm on a desk at heart level,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;resting it in their lap, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;letting it hang loosely by their side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. When arms hung by the side, systolic blood pressure (the top number) was an average of 6.5 mmHg higher and diastolic (the bottom number) 4.4 mmHg higher than when the arm rested on a desk. Even placing the arm on the lap showed elevated results, with systolic readings 3.9 mmHg higher and diastolic 4 mmHg higher compared to the desk position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those already diagnosed with high blood pressure, the difference was even greater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this group, systolic readings were 8.5 mmHg higher when the arm was hanging by the side instead of resting at chest level. These numbers matter, because such differences could lead to patients being prescribed stronger medications than they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Levine’s advice: Don’t let position skew results&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine highlighted the findings to raise awareness about proper technique. He explained that the blood pressure cuff should always be placed directly on the skin, not over clothing, and positioned on the forearm at heart level.

According to the CDC, consistently high readings can influence treatment decisions, including prescriptions for lifelong medication. A reading that’s just a few points higher than reality could mean someone ends up being treated for high blood pressure unnecessarily, with potential side effects from drugs they may not actually need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The correct way to measure blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends several best practices to ensure readings are accurate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid eating, drinking, or smoking 30 minutes before the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empty your bladder beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sit comfortably with your back supported for at least 5 minutes before measuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place both feet flat on the ground, legs uncrossed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest your arm on a table so the cuff is level with your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure the cuff fits snugly but not too tight, and always place it against bare skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay silent during the reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAJBVV95cUxNcEVOenZXVTFuX0wtV1ZMSVFDYmdSZTFsbll3TGFjM1J2MEJMVlRHUXo5Ynh2eGVLdHByM2FKb24zc0N5NlZlLU9JbWltNGx5WHMtYU5pTGJ1dmVSMUpSN19zYW9BbnYtUDdEckhCbnRwQlIzTlBCQ2N3VUVZS09qRDNSSXVyb3VNcDQxdHA0Tzd1YWJ2VVhFbGo0Zkx0Mm84Y25tVWx0OUZHTHJFUkpFUnAwZTZNYndCeUJZTjZKTWw5T3N1TVNWdURKUHpibXc4YS1KbVBFUWFqbXl2VzVTQWxnYlZVLUFxTk9aYzg4bDc1bHNFRTVpSEVBYVBDSGRsQnpBWVdSUndobngtX0tmODY2aVJXZnd3cWhUNndWQXhTdnVkSUlxekFFckhCTzYtajRQd2FfaXNaSzRq</guid></item><item><title>新的小便测试可以识别前列腺癌- futurity.org</title><link>https://www.futurity.org/urine-based-test-prostate-cancers-3296042/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="stickem-container"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have created a new urine-based test to ID prostate cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new approach could significantly reduce the need for invasive, often painful biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing urine samples from prostate cancer patients before and after prostate-removal surgery, as well as samples from healthy individuals, researchers identified a panel of three biomarkers—TTC3, H4C5, and EPCAM—that robustly detected the presence of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers were detectable in patients prior to surgery but were nearly absent post-surgery, confirming that they originated in prostate tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results appear in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105895"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer, one of the leading causes of death in men in the United States, is typically detected by blood tests to measure PSA, a protein produced by cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. In most men, a PSA level above 4.0 nanograms per milliliter is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy, in which multiple samples of tissue are collected through small needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the PSA test is not very specific, meaning prostate biopsies are often needed to confirm a cancer diagnosis, says senior study author Ranjan Perera, director of the Center for RNA Biology at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, and a professor of oncology and neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In many cases, these biopsies are negative and can result in unintended complications, Perera says. PSA tests also can lead to unnecessary treatment for very low-grade prostate cancers that are very unlikely to grow and spread over a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This new biomarker panel offers a promising, sensitive, and specific, noninvasive diagnostic test for prostate cancer,” Perera says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has the potential to accurately detect prostate cancer, reduce unnecessary biopsies, improve diagnostic accuracy in PSA-negative patients, and serve as the foundation for both laboratory-developed and in vitro diagnostic assays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was found to be able to detect prostate cancer even when PSA was in the normal range and could distinguish prostate cancer from conditions like prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and an enlarged prostate, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a real need for non-PSA-based biomarkers for prostate cancer, and urine is quite easy to collect in the clinic,” says study coauthor Christian Pavlovich, a professor of urologic oncology at Johns Hopkins and program director for the Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most urologists feel that an accurate &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/dogs-smell-prostate-cancer-2534232/"&gt;urinary biomarker&lt;/a&gt; would be a valuable addition to our current diagnostic armamentarium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the study, investigators studied biomarkers in urine samples from healthy individuals as well as from patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer undergoing prostate-removal surgeries at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, or AdventHealth Global Robotics Institute in Celebration, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They studied 341 urine specimens (107 from healthy individuals, 136 from patients with prostate cancer before surgery, and 98 after surgery) during the development of their urine test and an additional 1,055 specimens (162 from healthy individuals, 484 from patients with prostate cancer before surgery, and 409 after surgery) to validate the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the performance evaluation phase of testing, the scientists also studied samples from patients with BPH or prostatitis, and healthy controls, from Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2022 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators extracted RNA from prostate cells shed in 50-ml urine samples and analyzed them using RNA sequencing and also real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to study gene expression. They also used immunohistochemistry to study biomarkers in samples from cancerous prostate tissue and healthy adjacent tissue, and statistical analyses to compare biomarkers found in the urine and tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an initial 815 prostate-specific genes identified in urine from men with prostate cancers, the investigators prioritized the top 50 genes, then the top nine, and from there selected the three top performers—TTC3, H4C5, and EPCAM—for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, expression levels of the three biomarkers were significantly higher in urine samples from individuals with prostate cancers than in urine from the healthy controls. The expression of each biomarker diminished to low or undetectable levels in samples taken after surgery. A greater proportion of patients with prostate cancer tested positive for the three biomarkers than for PCA3, another biomarker associated with prostate cancers, in both the development study and the validation study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This test has the potential to help physicians improve diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer, reducing unnecessary interventions while allowing &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/advanced-prostate-cancer-radioactive-molecules-2578992-2/"&gt;early treatment&lt;/a&gt; for those who need it,” says study coauthor Vipul Patel, director of urologic oncology at AdventHealth Cancer Institute in Celebration, Florida. Patel also is medical director of global robotics for AdventHealth’s Global Robotics Institute, and founder of the International Prostate Cancer Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On behalf of physicians and patient globally, I advocate for further study and progress for these biomarkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are considering how the biomarker panel could be used alone or combined with a PSA test to make a “super PSA,” Perera says. The next steps for the research are to have an independent trial of the test at another institution and to further develop the test for laboratory use in clinical settings, he says. The investigators have filed a patent, and Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures is helping the team to spin off a company.&lt;/p&gt;

The most popular ingredients for loaded water include coconut water, electrolyte powders, prebiotic sodas, and fresh fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-9" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loaded water: Pros &amp;amp; Cons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitian Fiorella DiCarlo believes that loaded water is a healthier alternative to sodas and juices, which often contain lots of sugar and calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-10" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loaded water offers flavour with fewer calories, less sugar and no artificial additives if made thoughtfully,” DiCarlo told The Post, noting that extra electrolytes can help the body recover after a workout by replacing essential minerals lost through sweat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-11" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she said, for people who aren’t exercising intensely, electrolyte needs can be met through a balanced diet consisting of spinach, bananas, yoghurt, nuts and dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-12" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If consumed regularly without intense exercise or heavy sweating, loaded water made using pre-made electrolyte waters or mixes high in sodium, can lead to health problems like high blood pressure, kidney strain, heart troubles and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-14" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loaded water: Homemade recipes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiorella DiCarlo said that homemade infused water can be just as effective in fighting dehydration without the added cost of commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-15" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's a general recipe for homemade loaded water you can enjoy:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a pitcher of cool drinking water or an antioxidant-rich decaf green tea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a fruit. The dietitian favours electrolyte-packed options such as watermelon, citrus fruits, lemons, or oranges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly wash and cut fruit and slice herbs to release aromatics and enhance the infusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steep for two to four hours in the fridge or overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strain fruit and herbs. DiCarlo noted that leaving ingredients in the water for too long can turn the water bitter and may also encourage bacterial growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store infused water in a sealed container in the refrigerator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consume within two to three days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loaded water: Flavoured recipe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pineapple and coconut infusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Take 1 litre of distilled water, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/web-stories/5-health-benefits-of-pineapple-visual-story-11745040443714.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="pineapple"&gt;pineapple&lt;/a&gt; chunks, and 2 cups of electrolyte-rich coconut water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watermelon and mint infusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Take 1 litre of water, 3 sprigs of fresh mint and 2 cups of seedless watermelon.

He spent plenty of time with his grandkids. He went to church regularly. And he loved the simple things, like a bowl of pasta or a sub from his favorite deli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in February 2024, everything changed. Every meal left Langevin with heartburn. He could barely eat, and even a little bit of food made him feel full. While he used to regularly eat a whole sub, now a quarter of the sandwich left him feeling full and kept him from eating for days. He was often nauseous, and he became afraid of eating because of the pain food caused him. He lost 20 pounds in three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't think I was going to make it, to be honest," Langevin told CBS News. "I just wasn't feeling good at all. I'd be laying out in the sunroom on the couch most of the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langevin struggled to learn what was wrong with him. His general doctor "did all sorts of tests," Langevin said, including checking his liver and pancreas. Finally, in May 2024, a stomach scan revealed that he had an &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/danielle-perea-intestinal-transplant-mesenteric-ischemia/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unusual condition called mesenteric ischemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;unusual condition called mesenteric ischemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. His doctor said he'd only seen it once before. Langevin had never heard of it and researching the condition filled him with fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made the bad decision of going on Google and checking this out, and oh my gosh, I thought I had only a few years left by the way those articles were," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialist that his primary care physician sent him to see set him straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'Don't ever look at that stuff, just don't,'" Langevin said. "He said, 'We're going to get you through it.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is mesenteric ischemia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesenteric ischemia occurs when narrowed or blocked arteries restrict blood flow to the small intestine, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesenteric-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374989?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Mayo Clinic's website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic's website&lt;/a&gt;. There are two forms of mesenteric ischemia: Acute and chronic. Acute mesenteric ischemia occurs suddenly and is often caused by a blood clot, according to the Mayo Clinic. Chronic mesenteric ischemia builds up over time and usually occurs when fatty deposits build up in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronic case of the condition can become acute if left untreated, the Mayo Clinic said. The condition can cause pain, malnutrition and potentially fatal complications, including intestinal damage and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;An abdominal scan shows the blockage in Ed Langevin's superior mesenteric artery. / Credit: Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langevin had the latter form of the disease, said Dr. Gabriel Wallace, the director of vascular surgery at the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital. Langevin's condition was "pretty extreme," Wallace said. Patients like Langevin tend to be miserable by the time they are diagnosed, Wallace said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can't eat, they lose weight, they start becoming malnourished, and there's a real psychiatric or psychologic detriment," Wallace said. "The psychological toll of not being able to eat, the disruption of your normal life, the pain, the fear of eating, it totally wrecks people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating mesenteric ischemia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mesenteric ischemia is dangerous and unpleasant, it's not difficult to treat, Wallace said. He performed a minimally invasive procedure on Langevin in June 2024, placing a stent in the superior mesenteric artery. The stent holds the artery open and allows blood to flow normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery took less than an hour, Wallace said. Langevin was sent home the same day. He was also placed on antiplatelet medication, Wallace said. Langevin said that when he returned for his two-week check-up, he was able to eat an entire sub sandwich without any discomfort first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The stent placed in Ed Langevin's superior mesenteric artery. / Credit: Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about a year, everything went well. In March 2025, Langevin began feeling bloating and discomfort after eating again. He returned to Wallace. A scan found that some scarring from the first surgery was compressing the stent. Wallace said it was not an uncommon complication and he performed a second procedure that extended the stent. Langevin will continue to receive regular follow-up care to ensure that the condition is correctly managed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to normal  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, about six months out from his follow-up surgery, Langevin is back to his old self. Steaks, pasta and sandwiches are back on the menu. He has gained back most of the weight he lost and is back to spending plenty of time with his grandkids.

She and her husband raced out the door of their rural home on the outskirts of Baker City in eastern Oregon, hoping to make the hour-long journey to a hospital before she delivered their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ISIIC3KARBF5HDZZGPN7A23KXE"&gt;They could not go to the hospital just 15 minutes away, Saint Alphonsus Medical Center, which shuttered its labor and delivery unit in August 2023 — weeks before the couple found out they were expecting a second child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2FZPZOBFTNBTZDAQZFE3CW5FGU"&gt;Banister, 25, dreaded the prospect of giving birth without the Baker City obstetrics program.

Oregon Medical Group plans in November to &lt;a href="https://www.oregonmedicalgroup.com/obgyn" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;shut down its OB-GYN department&lt;/a&gt;, which serves patients at McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center in Springfield, because of an exodus of providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QA2ENOPO4NGEBJDA4PH7OZQY7U"&gt;The Samaritan Health system was also &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/05/samaritan-health-considers-closing-maternity-units-in-lebanon-lincoln-city.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;considering eliminating labor and delivery units&lt;/a&gt; at two of its five hospitals — North Lincoln and Lebanon Community, both serving rural areas — due to resource and cost constraints. But last month, amid a groundswell of community opposition, the health care system announced it would hold off on closing the departments and explore alternatives to “ensure services remain viable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="37C7TMIW3ZBLZDMQIS2RTEU4OM"&gt;When Saint Alphonsus announced plans to close the Baker City maternity ward in June 2023, it pinned the decision on similar difficulties, saying it was “increasingly unsustainable” to adequately staff the obstetrics department amid nursing shortages and a decline in the number of births at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3EY3SIB2Y5CS3LQULSXQ3XFFAQ"&gt;In a statement to InvestigateWest, Andrew Whelan, a spokesperson for Saint Alphonsus, said the system is in negotiations to potentially revive the unit, although work to overcome the challenges that led to its closure “will take time and the outcome is not guaranteed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4M4AMAGKDFENFH2F5VBAVL3UMY"&gt;“We are committed to and are currently working with stakeholders to attempt to overcome these challenges if possible,” the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3JJWJBQDLBDVTGECD3DCZBNI5I"&gt;Until then, Banister and her husband are weighing whether expanding their family in a maternity care desert is worth the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LEPRNFGSV5BWDPZHKCEI43EY3E"&gt;“I was happy everything worked out for me, but then I had the frustration of like, ‘Well, what if it didn’t work out and what if something more serious happened?’” she said. “Now going into it, I’m definitely more scared.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;‘Hospitals on the brink’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WVBXFY43WRC3PCHWPQHH4YKXYQ"&gt;Hospitals across Oregon have increasingly struggled to make ends meet since the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled in part by a growing delta between the cost of providing care and what they are actually paid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F3DA4U7Q3VEYNIVPJIOLFOAGPU"&gt;An April &lt;a href="https://oregonhospitals.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025.04.25_Report_Oregon-Hospitals-on-the-Brink_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;report by the Hospital Association of Oregon&lt;/a&gt; pointed to increased labor and supply costs, the slow financial recovery after the pandemic, lagging insurance reimbursement rates, administrative burdens and longer patient stays as issues driving the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WG3UEHD5KRBGVDADBFADWLPR3Q"&gt;According to the report, over the past few years nearly three-quarters of the state’s hospitals have been functioning in the red or with an operating margin of 3% or less — a difference too slim by industry standards to be considered sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5O74WEYRJNDOZPF3VFXORD4MKM"&gt;An InvestigateWest analysis of financial disclosures submitted to the Oregon Health Authority shows the average operating margin among the state’s 60 hospitals was about -0.5% in 2024.

Both plans pay providers significantly less than commercial insurers, the Hospital Association says: Medicaid in Oregon only reimburses about 56 cents for every dollar spent on a patient’s care, while Medicare pays back 82 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IWII5WSG7RDFFPL46DYTMZ2WV4"&gt;A high proportion of patients on Medicaid can be an indicator of a hospital’s financial vulnerability. In a &lt;a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_on_rural_hospitals.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;June letter&lt;/a&gt; opposing the “Big Beautiful Bill,” U.S. Senate Democrats used this metric to identify rural hospitals across the country that could be financially devastated by Medicaid cutbacks, putting them “at-risk” of service cuts or closure. Whether a hospital had been operating with negative margins for three or more years was another factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7SBMSNXTH5FUVAPTUMOZLDK66Y"&gt;Four Oregon medical centers were identified as “at-risk” in the letter.

The system was also looking at consolidating its urology, orthopedics and general surgery services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41" data-gaid="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QK5CDZXI6JA7TPFIDX4KWMTPRM"&gt;“We just might not be able to [offer labor and delivery] in all five of our hospitals,” Cahill said. “We might have to start to consolidate down to a fewer number of hospitals, so that we can again provide that quality of care that we want to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-42" data-gaid="inarticle-42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4ARR3UHXKRHL5OCEXLLPMPPUW4"&gt;Across the state, Wallowa Memorial Hospital CEO Dan Grigg says they are not yet talking about service cuts. But as the head of a small, independently owned medical center serving roughly 8,000 people in rural northeastern Oregon, Grigg understands the difficult decisions some hospitals may make to cut or reduce high-cost services like obstetrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-43" data-gaid="inarticle-43"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KTLI45XL2RDBZESNKPBTDQNEBY"&gt;“When it comes between closing a hospital and closing a service,” Grigg said, “you’re always going to close the service before you close the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-44" data-gaid="inarticle-44"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;Growing maternity care deserts &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-45" data-gaid="inarticle-45"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3HNIYANVCJFSDBXUZ56WBPMNRU"&gt;Maternity care has increasingly been on the receiving end of cutbacks as hospitals try to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-46" data-gaid="inarticle-46"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QHGT47OL3RD7TOX4JVQDD7BUMY"&gt;Since 2010, more than 500 hospitals in the U.S. closed their obstetrics units, leaving more than half of all rural hospitals and a third of all urban hospitals without the service, according to a study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2827543" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;medical journal JAMA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-47" data-gaid="inarticle-47"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E544XQAFYJATPCHJ73STJOPK64"&gt;Kozhimannil, who was a lead author on the study, says there are a few reasons why a hospital might decide to shutter a maternity ward, but they all boil down to a question of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-48" data-gaid="inarticle-48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5Y3J3WGAQNCTZB6ZP3OG57ZX5U"&gt;Like emergency rooms, labor and delivery units need to be staffed 24/7 in the event they receive a patient in the middle of childbirth. This means hospitals need to have obstetricians, labor and delivery nurses, anesthesiologists and neonatologists regularly on-call — positions that are highly specialized and difficult to hire for, especially in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-49" data-gaid="inarticle-49"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KRDZLNFAWRGCHMMLNW4QHGOF2I"&gt;This round-the-clock availability also translates to higher overhead costs which hospitals are rarely able to fully recoup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-50" data-gaid="inarticle-50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5QHJ7W5VLNEYVP7APMYNH7EBHY"&gt;For one, most simply do not receive enough patients for the department to be profitable. Kozhimannil says the average hospital needs about 200 births annually to keep their unit viable, but a third of facilities in the U.S. operate under that minimum threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-51" data-gaid="inarticle-51"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A2D2UEE7Z5ELDEEG35HFEK2AK4"&gt;“We do about 50 deliveries a year and so we’re only getting paid 50 payments for those deliveries,” said Grigg, the CEO of Wallowa Memorial. “If you do 1,000 deliveries with the same standby cost, you’re getting that payment a thousand times over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-52" data-gaid="inarticle-52"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TG2NGHJOQBCV7H3EKHJRSDTYMA"&gt;Even then, most payments from insurance don’t cover the full cost of care for childbirth. For instance, the average reimbursement the Oregon Health Plan &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/ANALYTICS/Pages/Hospital-Payment-Report.aspx" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;gave to hospitals in 2023&lt;/a&gt; for a complication-free, vaginal delivery was about $8,521. The average cost for this kind of delivery in the U.S. is about $15,712, per the &lt;a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/health-costs-associated-with-pregnancy-childbirth-and-postpartum-care/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative monitoring healthcare costs and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-53" data-gaid="inarticle-53"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VX3FXWWNIFFHBFJUPPB7UEZKZE"&gt;“If the overall organization is still profitable … you can absorb those financial losses,” said Davis, the CEO of Grande Ronde Hospital. “If the organization has multiple years of financial losses, now all of a sudden, your criteria and the lens has changed to where you’ve got to start looking at an individual department level or service line level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-54" data-gaid="inarticle-54"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DWC7Y4XUKVCSZMKRJDSMQZBH24"&gt;When a hospital closes an obstetrics unit, expectant mothers often end up traveling farther to reach the closest hospital, not only for labor and delivery but also for care related to potential complications and postpartum recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-55" data-gaid="inarticle-55"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2CFP5GP2C5E2PJZOP7BONVBJ5I"&gt;Studies have found this added distance lends itself to more births in riskier settings like emergency rooms, at home or in vehicles, as well as higher numbers of pre-term births. It also is associated with higher rates of maternal and infant mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-56" data-gaid="inarticle-56"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GQZ7F4423BE6TF4VNG55PWKJSY"&gt;Davis says Grande Ronde Hospital has had a 40% increase in births since Saint Alphonsus closed its unit in 2023. Anticipating an influx of patients from Baker City, the medical center hired on extra obstetrics nurses and trained their emergency room staff and first responders about what to do in the event a laboring woman cannot reach the hospital, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-57" data-gaid="inarticle-57"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UJFKO6R2KNEEBOQ2OYQMHNH4AU"&gt;“Minutes matter and they really do make the difference between a mother going home with a baby in her arms and a mother going home with empty arms,” said Amanda Vinson, a registered nurse at Samaritan Lebanon’s Girod Birth Center and member of the Oregon Nurses Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-58" data-gaid="inarticle-58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HBZMWWMLK5C7JI77IMUFGTTS4M"&gt;The loss of a birth center can additionally lead to decreases in the availability of other kinds of reproductive health care, like postpartum mental health support, doula and midwife services and gynecological surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-59" data-gaid="inarticle-59"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YZLHXVPAGVEZZKTZLUFH475AF4"&gt;“When a hospital stops providing obstetric services, those risks do not go away,” Kozhimannil said. “Those risks are still there, they’re just not borne by the hospital any more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-60" data-gaid="inarticle-60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;Accessing care where it isn’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-61" data-gaid="inarticle-61"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="65PINFNQPRF5ZEXGCBTQTK7GH4"&gt;When Baker City’s birth center shuttered, Shelley Payton, a local doula, tried to fill in the gap that was left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-62" data-gaid="inarticle-62"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZXMNZIR6LRF2HIQQBTGQXAZHK4"&gt;Her role had always been to support her clients through birth by facilitating communication with their care team and providing an extra set of hands wherever necessary. But in the aftermath of the closure, she became a coordinator and confidant for women across the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-63" data-gaid="inarticle-63"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OVQSRZRDJREEBPVBSJEXFZHUFY"&gt;Baker City is remote. Situated at the foot of Rock Creek Butte, the tallest peak in the Blue Mountains range, just one major highway links the town to La Grande to the west and Boise, Idaho to the east — Interstate 84. During the winter months, dangerous icy conditions regularly trigger shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-64" data-gaid="inarticle-64"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OQC2CU4I5RG4PCXWLAWYFBLONM"&gt;Payton said she began receiving anxious messages from women across the community who were concerned about how they would get to the hospital during a road closure, get help for potential complications or manage the cost of traveling to another city for care. The average household income in Baker County is about $58,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-65" data-gaid="inarticle-65"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G42UNHORPBGQLJGVOPEXM7XPVY"&gt;One woman who ended up going to the emergency room at Saint Alphonsus told Payton the doctors there missed that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition involving persistent high blood pressure that can lead to serious issues for both the mother and baby if left untreated. The woman only got that diagnosis a few days later, when she was able to make it to La Grande, according to the doula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-66" data-gaid="inarticle-66"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7WQ42X4NTZG75OPYIADRMSWNFY"&gt;Payton said other clients who went to Saint Alphonsus’ emergency room for possible pregnancy complications were told they could not be treated there and would need to be transported via ambulance or helicopter elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-67" data-gaid="inarticle-67"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PMAV4NFRARE4VJBAS4IV3DKZWY"&gt;The closure even impacted other areas of care. A mother of three told InvestigateWest she developed severe anemia after she was unable to get a timely procedure to address “uncontrollable” menstrual bleeding because Saint Alphonsus no longer provided the service in Baker City. It took another two months for her to get the procedure after she switched to another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-68" data-gaid="inarticle-68"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7Z3TWIPIFZFNHIHGZ2NN4M2KKE"&gt;“It’s no longer as easy as just showing up to the hospital in Baker like, ‘Yeah, I want to come in real quick and get checked out,’” Payton said. “That requires a lot more time and planning now and obviously that’s not something people want to do, especially if they’ve got a sleeping toddler at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-69" data-gaid="inarticle-69"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UVRA4R57IZBL5FOF5QMHQBGX7M"&gt;Weighing these risks, some women, like Dallas Pfeiffer, decided to temporarily relocate before their due date to be closer to a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-70" data-gaid="inarticle-70"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="63OYQBKWEFFD7ETAN2SPE4EL4I"&gt;Pfeiffer found out she was expecting a second child in the summer of 2023, shortly after the closure of Saint Alphonsus’ obstetrics unit. Having had a C-section during her first delivery, she thought picking a larger hospital in Boise would be a safer bet if something went awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-71" data-gaid="inarticle-71"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JX2MV573ZVFK5CDUWYYOILHRJY"&gt;Pfeiffer’s new doctor urged her to be in Idaho at least a week before her scheduled C-section, in case she went into labor early. Luckily, she had family nearby who were able to host her, her husband and 1-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-72" data-gaid="inarticle-72"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6ET2J7XUP5ACDARLIFRJBPFT3M"&gt;Just one day after giving birth, Pfeiffer was back in the car to make the two-hour journey back to Baker City, this time, trying to manage her newborn son and her still intense pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-73" data-gaid="inarticle-73"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6TUCWGFOZBCPNHD245CYVUYFPY"&gt;“My emotions were all over the map,” she said. “I wished that Baker was open.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wounds that do not heal are often caused by bacterial infections and are particularly dangerous for the elderly and people with diabetes, cancer and other conditions. Acetic acid (more commonly known as vinegar) has been used for centuries as a disinfectant, but it is only effective against a small number of bacteria, and it does not kill the most dangerous types.&lt;/p&gt;


										    
																																	&lt;p&gt;New research led by researchers at University of Bergen in Norway, QIMR Berghofer and Flinders University in Australia has resulted in the ability to boost the natural bacterial killing qualities of vinegar by adding antimicrobial nanoparticles made from carbon and cobalt. The findings have been published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03108" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular biologists Dr. Adam Truskewycz and Professor Nils Halberg found these particles could kill several dangerous bacterial species, and their activity was enhanced when added to a weak vinegar solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, Dr. Truskewycz and Professor Halberg added cobalt-containing carbon quantum dot nanoparticles to weak &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/acetic+acid/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;acetic acid&lt;/a&gt; (vinegar) to create a potent antimicrobial treatment. They used this mixture against several pathogenic species, including the drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Truskewycz said the acidic environment from the vinegar made &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacterial+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacterial cells&lt;/a&gt; swell and take up the nanoparticle treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Once exposed, the nanoparticles appear to attack dangerous bacteria from both inside the bacterial cell and also on its surface, causing them to burst. Importantly, this approach is nontoxic to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt; and was shown to remove bacterial infections from mice wounds without affecting healing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibacterial boost in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/vinegar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt; found in the study could potentially be an important contribution toward the ongoing battle against the rising antimicrobial resistance levels worldwide, with an estimated 4.5 million deaths associated with a direct infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Halberg said this study showed how &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/nanoparticles/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt; could be used to increase the effectiveness of traditional bacterial treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Combination treatments such as the ones highlighted in this study may help to curb antimicrobial resistance. Given this issue can kill up to 5 million people each year, it's vital we look to find new ways of killing pathogens like viruses, bacteria and fungi or parasites," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large-scale study of over 6 million couples across Taiwan, Denmark, and Sweden found that partners are more likely to share the same or similar psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Conditions analyzed included depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism, bipolar disorder, OCD, anorexia, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The findings suggest “assortative mating,” or how people often choose partners with similar traits and life experiences, may extend into mental health.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other explanations include shared environments, attachment styles, and social identity factors that foster closeness and mutual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers caution the results are observational only; timing of diagnosis and doctor bias may influence outcomes, and the study does not measure relationship quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Birds of a feather flock together” is a cliche for a reason when it comes to romantic relationships. Shared religious beliefs, values, &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/pspi0000467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;political affiliation&lt;/a&gt; and even music taste all &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;influence attraction&lt;/a&gt; and satisfaction in a relationship. But a recent study has now identified another unexpected factor that may bring couples closer together: sharing a similar mental health diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept of romantic partners sharing a psychiatric diagnosis is not new. Indeed, between &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mental-disorders-in-married-couples-assortative-mating/B021C0E81DD730C802612CDA65BA809D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mates-of-schizophrenic-mothers/ABC12CEE463EEF7DECFC2CF608A84B9A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt; several studies that explored the reasons why people choose their romantic partners included &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/assortative-mating-among-inpatients-with-primary-affective-disorder/17CA2893AB36365CF334CBDDB17DCD89" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychiatric diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; as a variable. However, no large-scale, cross-cultural investigation had been conducted until recently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using national health insurance data from more than six million couples in total, a team of researchers recently analyzed the degree to which psychiatric disorders were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02298-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shared between couples&lt;/a&gt;. They examined data from five million couples in Taiwan, 571,534 couples in Denmark and 707,263 couples in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They looked at nine psychiatric disorders in their analysis, including &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/young-adults-adhd-substance-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;substance-use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bipolar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anorexia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/adhd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/ocd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/schizophrenia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. They found that people with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder had a higher likelihood of marrying someone with the same or a similar psychiatric disorder than they did of marrying someone who isn’t diagnosed with one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the finding is robust, the authors do acknowledge there are some limitations when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first is that the timing of relationships and diagnoses were not recorded. This means that diagnosis could have occurred after the beginning of the relationship – and thus may not be the result of active choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a care provider’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00590-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;own biases&lt;/a&gt; may influence how likely they are to diagnose a person with a specific mental health condition. Since many couples share the same family doctor, this could influence their likelihood of being diagnosed with a psychiatric condition — and could have biased the results seen in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors stress their results are purely observational. This means they don’t explicitly consider the contributing factors as to why people with psychiatric diagnoses might be more likely to choose &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt; with each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there are several psychological theories that may help to explain this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-this-phenomenon"&gt;Understanding This Phenomenon&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Assortative mating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This theory assumes that we choose partners who are &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/ebs0000342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;similar to us&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this is applied to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.109739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;personality and social factors&lt;/a&gt; (such as shared religious or socioeconomic background). But this recent study suggests that this choice may extend beyond these factors and into how we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We tend to gravitate to those we have something in common with&lt;/em&gt;, even if it’s a psychological disorder. (© Charlize D/peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So a person with a specific psychiatric disorder – such as anxiety or autism – may be drawn to someone with a similar psychiatric disorder because they share similar traits, values or approaches to daily life (such as prioritizing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;structure and routine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Proximity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8721.00154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mere exposure effect&lt;/a&gt;, we often choose relationships with people that we live or work in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780367198459-REPRW43-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;close proximity to&lt;/a&gt; – or otherwise spend time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who share psychiatric diagnoses may be drawn to similar social situations. For example, people with substance use disorder may visit bars or other social settings where taking substances is more commonplace – and thus may be more likely to meet potential mates who are struggling with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2174/1874473708666150916112913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;similar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Attachment theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/bowlbyainsworth-attachment-theory/6D35C7A344107195D97FD7ADAE06C807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Attachment theory&lt;/a&gt; assumes that as infants, we develop a specific emotional bond to our primary caregivers. This early bond then shapes our subsequent emotional and psychological patterns of behavior as we get older – and also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00723.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;influences what we’re looking for&lt;/a&gt; in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So someone with an anxious &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/attachment-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;attachment style&lt;/a&gt; (which can manifest as fear of abandonment, desire for closeness or need for reassurance) might feel drawn to a partner who has a similar attachment style or exhibits the kind of behavior they desire – such as a partner who texts them all night when they’re apart. Even if this is not a healthy dynamic, the validation gained from a high-intensity relationship would likely make it hard to resist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research shows certain attachment styles are more common in people with specific psychiatric conditions. For example, anxious attachment style is more common in people who have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2991/assehr.k.200826.207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/sajpsyc/article/view/287901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;. This might help explain why the study found people with certain psychiatric conditions were more likely to be married to each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Social identity theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203505984-16/social-identity-theory-intergroup-behavior-henri-tajfel-john-turner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Social identity theory&lt;/a&gt; assumes that our self-esteem is gained through a sense of belonging within our social groups. So when you begin a relationship with somebody from within your social group, it boosts &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/self-esteem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;self-esteem&lt;/a&gt; as it brings a greater sense of belonging and feeling understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might explain why people with the same psychiatric diagnosis (a social group) would be drawn to each other. Finding someone who understands and experiences the same struggles you do could help you bond and make you feel understood and validated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for us? Well, the results reported by this recent study can only tell us whether couples share psychiatric diagnoses. They don’t tell us the quality and duration of the relationship, nor do they account for individual differences which may also affect the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, shared experiences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-020-04790-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;promote closeness&lt;/a&gt; and empathetic communication for couples – and it stands to reason that this would extend to psychiatric diagnosis. Having a partner who understands and can relate to your mental illness can provide social support and validation that’s not available from someone who has never struggled with their &lt;a href="https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.4102/curationis.v42i1.2015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The answer depends on a mix of physical, emotional, and situational factors. While it’s often said that women can go multiple rounds more easily than men, the reality is more nuanced and deeply individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why, it helps to know a bit about the &lt;u&gt;refractory period&lt;/u&gt;, the time after pleasure when the body needs to recover before becoming aroused again. For men, this pause is typically marked by an inability to get another arousal. For women, the signs (and the timeline) are far less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some women may be ready for another round of intimacy just seconds after climax. Others might feel too physically sensitive for a while, or simply feel satisfied and uninterested in continuing. A woman’s response can vary based on her physiology, her mood, her level of emotional connection with her partner, and even how intense the first pleasure was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how women feel about going for round two, we surveyed 120 people. Here’s what they had to say, along with what science tells us about the female refractory period, and how it compares to men’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do Women Have a Refractory Period?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.issm.info/sexual-health-qa/what-are-multiple-orgasms-how-common-are-they/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Society for Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Society for Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most women have the capacity to have multiple times of pleasure, suggesting a short or non-existent refractory period, but only about 15 percent of women do, according to past research conducted on the topic. Men, on the other hand, have refractory periods that can be as short as a few minutes for some, but up to 24 hours for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one small &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2013.867922?journalCode=hjsr20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2014 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2014 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers sought to explore gender-based differences in the pleasure experience. They had 38 men and 38 women bring themselves to pleasure via solo time while being monitored. The research revealed that after pleasure, the men’s arousal and desire dropped faster and more consistently than women’s, the men were more likely than women to feel completely satisfied, and the male genital temperature decreased more than that of the women’s. On the other hand, women’s feelings of arousal and desire after pleasure persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235884427_Evolving_ideas_about_male_refractory_period" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2013 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2013 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; proposed that hormone-like secretions called prostaglandins and a peptide called somatostatin may lengthen a man’s refractory period post-climax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all women feel ready to go again right away. An older &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288131749_Reconsidering_the_refractory_period_An_exploratory_study_of_women%27s_post-orgasmic_experiences" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2009 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2009 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 174 women revealed that 96 percent of the participants did not want more stimulation after pleasure due to increased sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Emotions May Affect the Female Refractory Period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts say that emotional factors may influence a woman’s desire for multiple rounds of intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiannon-john-sexologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rhiannon John;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rhiannon John&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist and intimacy educator, women’s individual experiences with a refractory period can vary widely. “While some may feel the need for a brief pause to recover or refocus, this is usually influenced more by mental or emotional factors than by physical limitations,” says John. She points to research by intimacy therapy pioneer Helen Singer Kaplan, who posited that desire and arousal often depend on emotional and situational factors, which can influence whether someone feels ready to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan is probably best known for proposing the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3555026/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:three-stage female intimacy response cycle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;three-stage female intimacy response cycle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. This model introduced desire as a necessary precursor to intimacy excitement and pleasure, whereas the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-advances/article/masters-johnson-their-unique-contribution-to-sexology/7D0F859B47D0EB589C21E37EFFABD597" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:earlier model;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by intimacy researchers William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson listed excitement as the first stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/009262300278641" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:developed by Rosemary Basson in 2000;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;developed by Rosemary Basson in 2000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deems the intimacy response cycle in women to be cyclical and strongly influenced by a desire for intimacy. While a man’s desire for intimate activity is said to be driven by his &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/guides/sex-drive" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:libido;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;libido&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Basson proposed that desire in a woman can be triggered after physical contact has been initiated or by her need for closeness and commitment to her partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Women Feel About Round 2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on an informal poll we conducted of 120 men and women, 73 percent of respondents said women did want a second round. Twenty-seven percent said they typically felt satisfied after one round and preferred not to continue right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the poll did not factor in age, stress levels, and intensity of the first pleasure, all of which are elements that might influence a woman’s desire for multiple rounds of intimacy. Her answer may also depend on the time of day, day of the week, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective way to know if your partner is interested in continuing? Open, respectful communication.

This can be especially helpful if you’re a man struggling with PE or other performance issues. If you’re concerned about not reaching pleasure together the first time, these strategies might help extend the experience—or support another round when you’re both ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start with &lt;span&gt;pre-play&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Take your time to build arousal again by engaging in &lt;span&gt;pre-play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/foreplay-ideas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: ideas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt; ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like kissing, cuddling, watching porn, or role-play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explore other parts of the body. &lt;/b&gt;If you find that your privates are too sensitive for stimulation after pleasure, try exploring other parts of the body to ease back into intimacy. Various hotspots all over the body, known as &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/erogenous-zones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:erogenous zones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;erogenous zones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, can induce pleasure when touched. Some lesser-known erogenous zones? Earlobes, inner thighs, and even the armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Try a new position.&lt;/b&gt; Different intimacy&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/best-sex-positions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: positions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt; positions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offer different sensations. You may be able to speed up the refractory period and get sufficiently aroused again by trying a new position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid excess alcohol consumption.&lt;/b&gt; Watching how much you drink isn’t just solid medical advice. It can also improve your intimate health. As a central nervous system depressant, alcohol &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10155345" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slows brain function and blood flow;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;slows brain function and blood flow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This can reduce stimulation and lead to difficulty in achieving pleasure. Excessive alcohol use is also &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/whiskey-dick-explained" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked to certain dysfunctions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to certain dysfunctions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like ED and low drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take ED medication.&lt;/b&gt; If you’ve been prescribed ED medication, you may notice that your refractory period is shorter than usual. However, you should never take &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/erectile-dysfunction" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ED medication;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ED medication&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recreationally or without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use adult toys.&lt;/b&gt; Toys can help extend pleasure or ease back into arousal, especially if your body needs a little more recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take care of your overall health. &lt;/b&gt;Following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep aren’t just best practices for protecting your overall health. They also boost intimacy function by supporting proper blood flow, which is crucial for arousal and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Final Word on How to Have Multiple Rounds of Intimacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure how long to wait for round 2, your best bet is to ask your partner. The refractory period varies widely, and whether or not a woman wants to go for a second round may differ day by day. Here’s what we know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Female refractory periods vary.&lt;/b&gt; Women typically have a shorter refractory period than men, allowing for the possibility of multiple times of pleasure. However, individual experiences vary, and the best way to know if she wants to go for another round is to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emotional and situational factors may influence her desire.&lt;/b&gt; A need for intimacy and connection can strongly influence a woman’s readiness for multiple rounds of intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You may be able to shorten the refractory period.&lt;/b&gt; Some tips to shorten the refractory period are to engage in &lt;span&gt;pre-play&lt;/span&gt;, try new positions, and avoid excessive alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like MediaFeed’s content? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/channel/source/Mediafeed/sr-vid-ckv6hf6hjif65e0cjnm83s7yb2y0w5xmun0j4refire0ev6727is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Be sure to follow us;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be sure to follow us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hims.com/blog/how-long-for-women-round-2#how-do-women-feel-about-round-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hims.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hims.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and was syndicated by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediafeed.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MediaFeed.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;MediaFeed.org&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:10:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBFX2ltN2g3dVdMeFdpaHFlck1fTEJTUTdZVHJVb01pTDRGbWo2VERlZWpZb3dPaEtxOW1rUFJsZVBwMEhpQWZkTWhON0lmTXNtYkFGRlBJb2s3NExFUzFRMUQ1NklmMC1CNzduRVJBLTg3TVQ1QVozVGNHdnoyeWs</guid></item><item><title>向后走可能是最奇怪的健康技巧- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/walking-backwards-might-weirdest-health-143300869.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people head into the gym ready to lift, run, or maybe squeeze in a set of lunges. What you don’t usually expect to see is someone walking backward with total focus, step after step, as if they’ve hit rewind on their workout. It looks odd at first glance—almost like a mistake—yet it’s catching on in surprising places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What seems like a quirky stunt is actually turning into a smart fitness strategy. Trainers, therapists, and everyday gym-goers are discovering that moving in reverse challenges the body in ways forward walking can’t. And as more research highlights the benefits, this strange-looking practice is starting to earn a spot alongside more traditional exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscles, Joints, and Calorie Burn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via iStockphoto/doble-d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retro walking, as experts call it, flips the movement pattern your body has mastered. It's a small change that has a surprising mix of physical and mental payoffs. Scientists at UCLA have found that walking backwards activates the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s control center for memory and decision-making. A Harvard-trained neuroscientist has recently taken it a step further by linking backward steps to sharper focus and faster recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're walking backward, instead of your quads absorbing each step with a heel strike, the motion changes to a toe-to-heel roll. This activates the hamstrings, calves, and stabilizers in new ways. Therapists now recommend it for knee rehab because the altered load on the joints helps build quad strength while reducing strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also easier on the hips and spine. Researchers tracking muscle activation patterns found that reverse walking engages muscles that support the lower back, while stretching tight hamstrings. People with chronic back pain have reported reduced discomfort after adding it into their routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re chasing calorie burn, the numbers are in your favor. Walking backwards increases energy use by close to 40 percent compared with forward walking at the same pace, according to published metabolic data. Treadmill studies confirm it, too, that at the same speed, you’ll burn more in less time, and climbing in reverse magnifies the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance, Focus, and Brain Gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking backward puts your balance to the test. Without the usual visual cues to guide you, your body has to rely more on proprioception—your built-in sense of where you are in space. That extra challenge sharpens coordination and stability, which is why athletes in sports like soccer and tennis often practice reverse drills. The payoff? Better focus, improved footwork, and a reduced risk of falls or ankle sprains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For older adults, such training can strengthen stabilizing muscles and improve gait speed, which translates into better confidence when moving around day to day. The brain gets its own workout, too. By disrupting the routine rhythm of walking, retro steps require active concentration. Studies have linked this to faster reaction times and improved problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even short sessions, about ten to fifteen minutes, have been shown to boost cognitive activity. Neuroscientists suggest the novelty of the movement creates fresh neural connections, which could help preserve memory and executive function as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Add It to Your Routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via Canva/ Aflo Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start slow and stay safe. Reverse walking outdoors comes with the obvious risk of tripping, so treadmills or clear hallways are better for beginners. Experts recommend beginning with a slow pace, keeping the chest upright, and reaching back with the toes before rolling through to the heel. Using handrails at first is smart until the movement feels natural. Start with five-minute intervals and work toward twenty minutes once or twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBJODBOa0ZlLXZ1Z05BV1NrSUZSb0pGcFVISXdQekRBbWpOWDVzWndfX3d3N2htUEJYSERYQ3BYb0MtMGpwcC12MWZuS2hVWHFtd0JnazJ0TnVvU3pxWEJRVXEweVBrc1RGekxHeGRNbVNRY08xZE1GR0s2algxN0k</guid></item><item><title>自闭症报告准备、新冠肺炎疫情高峰、不良ACIP头条新闻、跌倒和孤独攀登等-您当地的流行病学家</title><link>https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/autism-report-prep-covid-peaking</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Your Local Epidemiologist</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 13:46:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOZzdvMkpsQmdhQUp0LVAwQ29PbmxUVmVBQldHeTN0aE4wR2c3SnhSYjVFTWxmSjdYdFkyQTNzNWVGWEtnOERscWh6NFpVbWdpVGdmV0U3SlRHVmx5U0hZSjI4Vm9xazNZOU5nNy1COUpZTVRIR01PdFBodXU2NHFMdWhXYUlXZw</guid></item><item><title>我每天吃一个苹果一周，这是我的身体发生了什么-预防</title><link>https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a66128487/what-happens-when-you-eat-apple-every-day/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;div class="css-hl6xtf e1wzc3k51"&gt;&lt;img src="/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/clock-regular.b2f2888.svg" alt="Estimated read time" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span class="css-deygkq e1wzc3k50"&gt;5 min read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="1.0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As a dietitian, I’m constantly telling people to eat more fruits and vegetables. So, when my editor challenged me to practice what I preach in a very specific way—eating an apple every day for a week—I couldn’t say no. The old adage, “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” is practically folklore at this point, but is there any truth to it? I ate an apple every single day for a week to see how it impacted my body—and the results surprised me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;I’ll be honest, while I appreciate the nutritional powerhouse that is the apple, the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20481875/apple-varieties-and-recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20481875/apple-varieties-and-recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="type of apple" data-node-id="3.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;type of apple&lt;/a&gt; matters to me. The mushy texture of a Red Delicious? No, thank you. And while some people swear by Granny Smiths, they’re just a bit too tart for me. For this week-long experiment, I needed a variety I wouldn’t get tired of. I stuck with my all-time favorite: the Honeycrisp. It has the perfect balance of sweetness, tartness, and that all-important crunch. My plan was simple: Consume one medium Honeycrisp apple each day for seven days and take note of any changes, big or small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="4" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="What happened to my body when I ate an apple every day" data-anchor-id="what-happened-to-my-body-when-i-ate-an-apple-every-day" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;What happened to my body when I ate an apple every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Going into this, I didn’t expect any dramatic transformations. After all, it’s just one week and one apple. But I was pleasantly surprised by the subtle yet noticeable shifts I experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;First, my digestion felt more regular. Without getting into too much detail, things were “working.” My energy levels also felt more stable, especially in the afternoon. That 3 p.m. slump, which usually has me reaching for another cup of coffee, was less pronounced. Instead of a caffeine jolt, my daily apple provided a steady stream of energy that didn’t end in a crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;What genuinely caught me off guard, though, was how much I actually looked forward to “apple time.” I’ve never had much of a sweet tooth, but being required to enjoy a crisp Honeycrisp each day sprinkled a little happiness into my otherwise routine weekdays. Each small, juicy bite brought a welcome pop of joy I didn’t know I was missing. Plus, since I’m terrible at staying hydrated, I like to think the apple’s refreshing juiciness gave me a little extra boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Mentally, having a non-negotiable healthy habit felt great. It was a small daily win. I was also surprised that I never got bored. Some days I ate the apple whole, and on others, I got creative. My go-to became “apple nachos,” which is thinly sliced apple rounds arranged on a plate, drizzled with warm almond butter, and sprinkled with a bit of granola and cinnamon. It felt like a decadent treat, not a mandatory health food. Being “forced” to have something sweet and satisfying every day was a challenge I was happy to accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As a dietitian, I know that eating more fruit, like apples, is linked to a slew of positive health outcomes, like supported heart health and a reduced risk of cancer. I didn’t see my doctor that week (yes, it really kept the doctor away!), so I didn’t get a full work-up to learn if anything new developed health-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750343/nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750343/nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="United States Department of Agriculture" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA), a Honeycrisp apple contains around:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="13" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="13.0"&gt;84 calories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="13.1"&gt;0 g fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="13.2"&gt;20.6 g carbohydrates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="13.3"&gt;2.38 g of fiber&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="13.4"&gt;0 g of protein&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;My personal experience lines up with what we know about the science behind apples.

Insoluble fiber helps keep things moving through your digestive system, reducing the risk of constipation. And a fiber found in apples, called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38847603/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38847603/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pectin, acts as a prebiotic" data-node-id="17.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.5.0"&gt;pectin, acts as a prebiotic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This means it serves as fuel for the good bacteria in your gut, which is crucial for a healthy gut microbiome and overall digestive health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="18" class="body-h4 css-1p51vha emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Supports energy levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The afternoon energy boost is also easy to explain. Apples contain natural sugars, but their fiber content prevents them from leading to a rapid spike in blood sugar. The sugar is released slowly into the bloodstream, providing a sustained source of energy. It’s the perfect snack to power a busy afternoon without the jitters and eventual crash that come from processed snacks or sugary drinks. It also provides some hydration, which could help with energy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="body-h4 css-arf901 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Antioxidant power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Apples are loaded with powerful plant compounds and antioxidants that help protect your cells from damage. One of the most notable is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32848440/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32848440/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="quercetin, an antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory properties and supports immune function" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.1.0"&gt;quercetin, an antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory properties and supports immune function&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These compounds are most concentrated in the apple’s skin, so it’s best to eat the whole thing (after a good wash, of course). Eating a diet rich in antioxidants helps reduce oxidative stress in the body, which is linked to various chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="body-h4 css-arf901 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Brain health support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;One of the more intriguing areas of apple research has to do with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/brain-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/brain-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brain health" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.

This is because apples are high in &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FODMAPs" data-node-id="26.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;FODMAPs&lt;/a&gt;, a group of carbohydrates that can be difficult for some people to digest.

It is not the first to link gestational diabetes to neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but it is one of the largest. Researchers pooled results from 48 studies across 20 countries, finding that children born to people with gestational diabetes had lower IQ scores, a 36% higher risk of ADHD and a 56% higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. Estimates suggest the prevalence of autism in the general population is one in 127 people&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and between 3-10%&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of children and teenagers have ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results mirror those of another meta-analysis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/i&gt; journal in June, which included 56 million mother–child pairs and found that all types of diabetes in pregnancy, including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, increase the risk of the baby developing ADHD and autism. But none of these studies have been able to show that diabetes during pregnancy causes these conditions. “There’s no doubt that there is a signal here, but certainly further research is required,” says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long a topic of research, the causes of autism have been thrust into the spotlight by the administration of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1#ref-CR4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;US President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. On Sunday, while speaking at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump said: “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that?” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Trump’s administration is poised to announce a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol, during pregnancy. &lt;a href="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/f4cd8a064d47b62a-0e01df33044e-139fddfcb7c79fd0c38a7065fad62081b237334047fed3a63e4463e31f34.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/f4cd8a064d47b62a-0e01df33044e-139fddfcb7c79fd0c38a7065fad62081b237334047fed3a63e4463e31f34.pdf" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Medical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; say acetominophen is safe to use during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, genetics has the strongest influence on the risk of developing ADHD and autism.

&lt;p&gt;CITYWIDE — Local health officials are urging Chicagoans to get vaccinated against mpox amid a spike in cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been 81 new cases of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, reported in Chicago over the past six months — and 90 percent of them have been diagnosed since June 10, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health. Fourteen new cases were reported Sept. 9-15 alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mpox has particularly affected gay, bisexual and same-gender-loving men in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Crone, infectious disease specialist physician at Howard Brown, said his organization’s clinic has seen the increase — and vaccination remains key to reducing the severity of illness.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“While we can and have seen cases in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, vaccination can still provide good protection and minimize the severity of the symptoms experienced if a person is infected,” Crone said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can range from mild to severe, including bumps or sores and significant anal pain. Anyone with symptoms should get tested and isolated until they receive a diagnosis, Crone said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-CALOR-Monkeypox-Vaccines-Colin-Boyle-7949.jpg?resize=1650%2C1098&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-560953"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Community health RN Margaret Mary Butler fills a syringe with the smallpox and mypox vaccine during a vaccination clinic at CALOR in Humboldt Park on Aug. 17, 2022. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment is largely supportive care and pain management until the infection resolves. Health officials are also reminding people who only received one dose of the two-dose vaccine series to complete the series for stronger protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To combat the surge, the health department is making mpox vaccination the centerpiece of clinics this fall where people can also get flu and COVID shots. The mpox vaccine is also available at the city’s &lt;a href="https://click.citynews.chicago.gov/?qs=443e6e23c13479462e224b1cff570fae5e72a539c6d6c663ce0e21c0c2fe9157126b2f9ee77898e501bae6b25af866aa59e3620ec458eb65" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sexual Health Clinics&lt;/a&gt; in Lakeview, Austin and Roseland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While anyone can get mpox, this summer’s increase has disproportionately affected sexually active gay, bisexual, and same-gender-loving men,” health department officials said in a press release. “Adding the mpox vaccine to your fall health routine is the best way to protect yourself and your community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-mpox-spread"&gt;How Does Mpox Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mpox spreads through:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct contact with a person’s infectious rash, scabs or body fluids.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling or sex.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Touching items — like clothing or bedding — that have previously touched a person’s infectious rash or body fluids.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;From an infected pregnant person to a fetus.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Infected animals scratching, biting or being consumed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People can spread the virus from the time they show symptoms until their rash has fully healed. Those without symptoms cannot spread mpox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symptoms-of-mpox"&gt;Symptoms Of Mpox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most notable symptom is a rash that can resemble pimples or blisters, appearing on the face, hands, chest, genitals or anus. The rash can also develop internally, making it painful to eat, drink or use the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other common symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Muscle and back aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Swollen lymph nodes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rash can be “excruciatingly painful,” health experts have warned. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care and testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-CALOR-Monkeypox-Vaccines-Colin-Boyle-7788.jpg?resize=1650%2C1098&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-560934"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Community health RN Kristen Figueroa administers the smallpox and mpox vaccine to a patient during a vaccination clinic at CALOR in Humboldt Park on Aug. 17, 2022. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-do-if-you-think-you-have-mpox"&gt;What To Do If You Think You Have Mpox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolate from others and avoid skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not share bedding, towels or other linens.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid sex or intimacy until evaluated by a medical professional.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Contact a health provider or call the health department at 312-746-4835 to get connected to testing and care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-get-vaccinated-in-chicago"&gt;Who Can Get Vaccinated In Chicago&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are available to anyone in Illinois who fits any of these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has had skin-to-skin contact with someone diagnosed with mpox.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People who exchange sex for goods or services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People living with HIV, particularly those not in regular care.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People taking or eligible for PrEP.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexually active gay, bisexual and same-gender-loving men.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexually active transgender people.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexual partners of the above groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-to-get-vaccinated"&gt;Where To Get Vaccinated&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Department of Public Health has a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/infectious_disease/supp_info/mpox-home/mpox-vaccine.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;map of clinics where people can be vaccinated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I was diagnosed with stage 4 high-grade ovarian cancer in September 2024. I underwent a major surgery after the tumor shrank in March. I see a top doctor at a renowned hospital, and I trust him. I went through seven rounds of chemo with three different meds. I handled it well as I am very fit and 64 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IYWIR7NYBNCANAJWBCK4SAOKZM"&gt;I am now on maintenance medications (Avastin and Lynparza). My numbers are going up. I know my outlook isn’t good, but I try to live my best life. I have a lot of different things to look forward to (marriages, grandbabies, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U2A3OS75LFBKTN776ZXHHUNQPM"&gt;I have many friends who keep suggesting ivermectin as a treatment. (These people are also anti-vaxers.) I can’t fall into this group of people as I believe in modern medicine and have trusted my doctor. So, my question is: What are your thoughts about this treatment, and what have you heard about it within the medical community? -- L.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5MP3WC3KVBAERMDAHLMUAZEJZE"&gt;ANSWER: I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I congratulate you on your good attitude. The treatment for ovarian cancer has changed dramatically in the past few years. There are many treatments, and although they are often not able to cure cancer, they can keep cancer at bay -- sometimes for many years, even decades. Having an important life event to look forward to is important to maintaining a good attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HON7EIS2TNBRFDUDUL4KIM3AKM"&gt;As far as ivermectin goes, there is a small possibility that it will turn out to be a useful treatment for cancer. I have read some preclinical studies that suggested some benefit. However, no studies that were done on actual people have proven it to be useful for any cancer so far. Many promising drugs turn out to be failures after the initial clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HQNQFWNSA5GMTOGK7UFJYEQLXM"&gt;There are people who feel that there are hidden treatments for cancer and that there is a massive conspiracy to keep successful cancer treatments from being used. Having known many doctors and research scientists who unfortunately died from cancer themselves, I can assure you that this isn’t the case. Many scientists across the globe are working hard to find new treatments, and every year brings incremental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XCVSOSUZY5BNROVMWBACTMVATI"&gt;Ivermectin is the most recent “miracle treatment” that I have heard about. I can recall easily at least a half dozen miracle treatments in the past 20 years that haven’t turned out to be useful. Some of these are not only useless but are actively harmful. While ivermectin is generally safe when dosed appropriately for its indication of treating parasites, it can be dangerous at high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PB74VRHHERDVRNGFMZ7M626CPM"&gt;I respect the use of alternative treatments to manage the symptoms that are caused by cancer treatments such as chemotherapy. However, people who rely on alternative treatments for treatment of their cancer do not do as well as people who are getting the best care that modern medicine currently has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RTJ6JOTH5JFOFCOTZ24BYR326M"&gt;I recommend that you thank your friends for their advice and tell them that you trust your medical team and will follow what your doctor recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.
