			&lt;p&gt;Research in mice showed limited intakes of one particular essential amino acid can slow the impacts of aging and even lengthen their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists now wonder if these findings could help people improve their longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isoleucine is one of three branched-chain amino acids we use to build proteins in our bodies. It is essential for our survival, but since our cells can't produce it from scratch, we have to get it from sources like eggs, dairy, soy protein, and meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNHCTR9u4y4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can always be too much of a good thing. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00166-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413121001662%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; using data from a 2016-2017 survey of Wisconsin residents had found dietary isoleucine levels were linked with metabolic health and that people with higher BMIs were generally consuming much greater quantities of the amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie, and we've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of," metabolism researcher Dudley Lamming from the University of Wisconsin, US, who was involved in both studies, &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 when the newest findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's interesting and encouraging to think a dietary change could still make such a big difference in lifespan and what we call 'healthspan,' even when it started closer to mid-life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent study, a genetically diverse group of mice was fed either a diet containing 20 common amino acids as a control, a diet where all amino acids were reduced by about two-thirds, or a diet where only isoleucine was reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were around six months old at the start of the study, which is the equivalent age of a 30-year-old person. They could eat as much as they wanted, but only from the specific kind of food provided to their group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg" alt="Various soy foods" class="size-full wp-image-146146" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Our cells can't produce isoleucine from scratch – we have to get it from foods such as soy protein. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFMZwKkZ1w/"&gt;ArtStudio Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting dietary isoleucine increased the lifespan and healthspan of the mice, reduced their frailty, and promoted leanness and glycemic control. Male mice had their lifespans increased 33 percent compared to those whose isoleucine was not restricted, and females had a 7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mice also scored better in 26 measures of health, including muscle strength, endurance, blood sugar levels, tail use, and hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The male mice in this group had less age-related prostate enlargement, and were less likely to develop the cancerous tumors that are common in the diverse mice strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the mice given low isoleucine food also ate significantly more calories than the others. But rather than gaining weight, they actually burned more energy and maintained leaner body weights, even though their activity levels were no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_112585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg" alt="Graphical abstract shows dietary isoleucine was restricted by 67%, charts showing blood glucose and body weight declining over time / age respectively, reduced frailty and cancer, increased lifespan (survival improved by 33 percent)" class="wp-image-112585 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg 996w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A visual summary of the impact the reduced isoleucine diet had on mice in the study. (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00374-1"&gt;Green et al., C&lt;em&gt;ell Metabolism, &lt;/em&gt;2023)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think restricting isoleucine in humans, either by diet or pharmaceutical means, has the potential to yield similar anti-aging effects - although, as with all mice studies, we won't know for sure until it's actually tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done. Although the food provided to the mice was controlled, the researchers noted that diet is an incredibly complex chemical reaction, and there may be other dietary components involved in producing these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restricting protein intake in general, for instance, has detrimental effects on the body, mouse or human. Translating this research for real-world human use is more complicated than just reducing intake of high-protein foods, even though this is the simplest way to limit isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amino acid restriction level was constant in all experiments, and they acknowledge that more fine-tuning may be required for optimum effects across different mice strains and sexes – when it comes to diet, one size does not fit all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can't just switch everyone to a low-isoleucine diet," Lamming &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But narrowing these benefits down to a single amino acid gets us closer to understanding the biological processes and maybe potential interventions for humans, like an isoleucine-blocking drug."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(23)00374-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This conclusion comes from a natural experiment in Wales, where vaccine eligibility was determined by birthdate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used rigorous statistical methods, typically seen in economics, to isolate the effect of the shingles vaccine from other factors. Their findings suggest that routine immunization could play an unexpected role in protecting brain health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% Risk Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Shingles vaccination was linked to a 20% lower risk of dementia over seven years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Experiment Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Eligibility for the vaccine was based on exact birthdate, allowing a unique causal analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Prevention Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings point to potential public health strategies for reducing dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination to prevent shingles also reduces the risk of developing dementia in later life, according to a research paper published recently in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is based on the analysis of data collected in connection with the introduction of a shingles immunization program launched in Wales in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108467"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a doctor with a syringe." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/shingles-vaccine-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Because the individuals in the study cohort were only a few weeks apart in age, the researchers could assume that vaccination was the only factor that set the groups apart. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists with their special expertise in statistical analyses have made a significant contribution to the corresponding study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to apply our capabilities in statistics to medical data, thus forging a bridge between these two fields,” said Dr. Markus Eyting of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with co-lead author Dr. Min Xie, a postdoctoral researcher at the Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, he demonstrated that the shingles vaccination was associated with a 20 percent reduction in the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a period of seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted in the article, “A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia,” this could raise various new possibilities for dementia prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic health records for Wales supply basis for statistical analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Min Xie identified the groundwork of what would represent a “natural experiment” created by the introduction of a herpes zoster vaccination program in Wales about two years ago. In the program, the eligibility to receive the vaccine was determined by an individual’s exact date of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born before 2 September 1933 were automatically ineligible for life, while those born on or after 2 September 1933 were entitled to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can speak of a natural experiment in this context because this setting gives us the opportunity to compare individuals who had just turned 80 with those who had not quite reached 80 years of age,” Eyting explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the individuals in the study cohort were only a few weeks apart in age, the researchers could assume that vaccination was the only factor that set the groups apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We then looked at the risk of developing dementia over the next seven years,” Eyting continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of the analysis was to identify a potential causal effect rather than just a correlation. In other words, the researchers were looking for a causal relationship between the shingles vaccine and the risk of developing dementia, not just a random connection between the two factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In economics, threshold values and target dates – in this case, the individuals’ birthdays – are often employed to test for causal effects using regression discontinuity designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This method is widely used in economics but has not yet been adequately recognized as a tool for clinical research,” Eyting added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his view, regression discontinuity analyses offer many opportunities for evaluating the effectiveness of public health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markus Eyting is a postdoctoral researcher at the Gutenberg School of Management and Economics (GSME) of Mainz University and at the Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE in Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research focuses on experimental methods and survey and administrative data to study the interplay of beliefs and individual decision making with applications relating to health, discrimination, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also involved in the study were Dr. Simon Heß of the Vienna University of Economics and Business, who supported the data analysis with his expertise in econometric methodologies, as well as researchers from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyting received the 2023 Young Economist Award from the European Economic Association (EEA) for a paper on the cause of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this vaccines and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f49f95809c869d9ada829b9d9380b4819a9dd999959d9a8eda9091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kathrin Voigt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-mainz.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kathrin Voigt – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia&lt;/a&gt;” by Markus Eyting et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="inline-recommendations"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 13:14:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBWZTVuTElSMkZhMktOWncwLU1ERnFDT3hkWXZKYlY1QnQyMlR3Wm5wRjF0N2FDczlXLWNKckJhUmwyR0ZaOW01ZTRtUmlRUktWbUhLYm0xU3VqNHpMbFluN1lUMlFCbWxCV2Uwb2V3</guid></item><item><title>I’m a brain health expert.

    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a glowing couple in their 20s, working and partying hard, getting precious little sleep, says gastroenterologist Shilpa Ravella. Then fast-forward 30 years and the couple may have serious health issues such as &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/five-surprising-things-that-raise-risk-of-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Late nights, drinking and stress, all these things trigger low-level inflammation which can damage our tissues and then one day it turns into heart disease or cancer,” adds Ravella. “Yes, younger bodies tend to process things more favourably. But the processed food has got worse, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/cancers-that-are-on-the-rise-in-the-under-50s/"&gt;young onset colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; is skyrocketing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being slim isn’t a protection, adds Ravella. “You can be at the gym lifting weights, have big muscles and a flat tummy, but still be highly inflamed. More importantly, you could have a higher risk of disease down the line, without having a clue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden, chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation is a “hot topic” in health and wellness because it’s increasingly recognised as a major driver of heart disease, cancer and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2025/01/14/alzheimers-professor-check-research-brain-health/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, as well as autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (where the immune system starts to attack the healthy cells of organs and tissues). And scientists now believe “inflammaging” is one of several essential factors that drive ageing in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, just naturally through a combination of genetics and the sum total of our environmental exposures, our immune systems develop a natural propensity for wanting to engage in chronic inflammation,” explains Dr Nathan Curran, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;functional Medicine Practitioner at London’s Reborne Longevity Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re trying to prevent chronic disease, it needs to go beyond just screening for the disease,” he adds. “We need to be screening for the actual triggers of the disease before they emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is inflammation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation isn’t bad per se. It’s the immune system’s response to any traumatic event in the body tissues – for example, a scraped knee or finger cut. In case of “acute” inflammation, our immune system releases inflammatory cells and cytokines (small proteins that stimulate more inflammatory cells) to neutralise the invading virus or start healing injured tissue. You will experience redness, warmth and swelling, but it will be over in a matter of days. “Acute inflammation serves a very important role in keeping us alive,” &lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;ays Dr Curran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our evolutionary history, in order to protect our bodies from pathogens and poisons, we developed a hyperactive immune system, explains Ravella, author of &lt;em&gt;A Silent Fire: The Story of Inflammation, Diet and Disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is inflammation is not always harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic” inflammation happens when this response is switched on all the time, leaving your body in a constant state of alert. The body continues to send white blood cells on the attack in the absence of any threat. This disrupts normal bodily functions and can result in healthy tissues and organs being attacked. Plus your body never gets a chance to recuperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Inflammation and cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole topic of inflammation became a bit more “personal” last October when I learnt I have “a propensity for excessive inflammation on a genetic level” when I did a DNA test at Dr Curran’s clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clues were there already: I had high cholesterol and was a point from being pre-diabetic. I sneezed incessantly (and very loudly) after too much fizz or sugar, both of which raise inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have an ‘eager/active’ variant of the gene,” Dr Curran tells me. “This means a relatively mild trigger has the potential to trigger a disproportionately large/sustained release of TNF-alpha (a pro-inflammatory protein), unless we moderate the impact of this genetic variation through an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/cheap-vital-why-omega-3-helps-you-live-longer/"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;s, Vitamin D and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately Google TNF-alpha and find that, worryingly, this cytokine is implicated in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions including, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you have the genetic propensity doesn’t mean it will be translated into excessive inflammation,” he adds, “but you need to be mindful of your lifestyle and dietary exposures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s my family’s history of heart disease to consider, too. “When cholesterol accumulates in the arteries, it creates inflammation because it gets modified and oxidised,” explains British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Cambridge, Ziad Mallat. “And then the body recognises it as a stranger. This inflammation initially serves to clear the oxidised cholesterol from the arteries. But when the body is exposed continuously to this aggression, the clearance capacities become overwhelmed and the inflammation becomes chronic. This causes more build-up of fatty material in the arteries and later may create clots in the arteries, and cause heart attack and stroke. The same thing happens when you have high glucose in diabetes, or if you smoke; it causes injury to the arteries and that creates chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shock motivated me to change my diet (&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/gave-up-sugar-month/"&gt;I gave up free sugar,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/reduce-cholesterol-without-statins/"&gt;brought my cholesterol &lt;/a&gt;down naturally for this paper). Then in March I asked my GP for a CRP (C-reactive protein) blood test (CRP is produced by the liver and if there’s a higher concentration of CRP than usual, it’s a sign of inflammation) and, phew, it’s normal at the moment. The sneezing has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You were really lucky, because your sneezing was so obvious and not everybody has that,” says Thaddeus Stappenbeck, MD, PhD chair of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic. “Most people have more vague symptoms, like they don’t have the energy they used to, or they’re not sleeping well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cleveland Clinic, Dr Thaddeus’s research programme focuses on determining the root causes of inflammatory diseases with the goal of developing new therapies. “With certain types of inflammatory conditions, they can programme parts of your immune system so they simply malfunction which further fuels inflammation later. A really good example is sepsis. Patients who have had bloodstream infections and spent time in intensive care, if they survive and are able to leave the hospital, what’s well recognised is that parts of their immune system are no longer functional. So they’re at risk for repeat infections with worse overall inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The role of diet and the gut microbiome in inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function of the immune system is to protect us from invaders—and to be able to tell apart the cells of our own body from other cells that don’t belong to us. And scientists have estimated that about 70 per cent of the immune system lives in the gut microbiome. Chronic inflammation in the gut may be due to inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/ulcerative-colitis-symptoms-treatment-surgery/#:~:text=Ulcerative%20colitis%20is%20an%20inflammatory,which%20bleed%20and%20leak%20pus."&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;. But a modern Western diet high in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/rob-hobson-family-cooking/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; can literally cause our whole body to be on fire, too. The poorer the quality of a meal, the higher the inflammatory response. Our microbiome (and the trillions of bugs in our intestines crucial to human health) is worryingly damaged, in contrast to our ancestors who had better gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of inflammation contributes to most of our “21st-century” diseases, says Dr Stappenbeck. “The link between what’s going on in your gut microbiome, and diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or sleep disorders or depression is really amazing. We’re learning, for example, that Parkinson’s disease probably starts in many of these patients in the colon and becomes more evident once brain lesions have developed. A lot of patients with Parkinson’s have very severe constipation because the neurons in their colon are damaged and don’t function properly. They could have been experiencing that for years without realising. So could we diagnose Parkinson’s earlier before the cells of the brain are damaged?”&lt;/p&gt;

Ozempic (and drugs like it) aren’t magic. They won’t lead to long-lasting weight loss if you take them while eating a diet consisting of nutrient-void, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ultra-processed-foods_l_66db5dd9e4b07b62af62d0f8" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="ultra-processed foods" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66db5dd9e4b07b62af62d0f8" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what about the less obvious food rules you might not know about? In addition to changing the types of foods you eat, meal timing and portion size also are important to think about. And that’s not all. Here, bariatric physicians who prescribe these types of medications share the five most common food mistakes to avoid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 1: Not Reducing The Size Of Your Meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you start taking a prescription weight loss medication,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/muhammad-ghanem-md#/overview" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" Dr. Muhammad Ghanem," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/muhammad-ghanem-md#/overview" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr. Muhammad Ghanem,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a bariatric surgeon with the Orlando Health Weight Loss and Bariatric Surgery Institute, told HuffPost that it’s best to transition from eating three big meals a day to smaller, more frequent ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know that sleepy feeling that hits you right after a big meal? Ghanem shared that this happens because a big meal causes a surge in blood sugar, which then leads to a surge in insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down (resulting in fatigue). “All these spikes and drops in blood sugar and insulin cause insulin resistance, which causes weight gain. This is why small, frequent meals maintain a more steady blood sugar level, which means less insulin resistance, which means more weight loss,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eehealth.org/find-a-doctor/a/alatassi-diala/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Diala Alatassi," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eehealth.org/find-a-doctor/a/alatassi-diala/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Diala Alatassi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;an obesity medicine physician at Endeavor Health, shared another benefit of frequent, smaller meals — it can reduce unwanted side effects of weight loss medications. “Many weight loss medications slow gastric emptying, making large meals more likely to cause bloating, nausea and discomfort,” she said, adding that this is less likely to happen with smaller, more frequent meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/dexter-turnquest/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dexter Turnquest," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/dexter-turnquest/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Dexter Turnquest,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bariatric medical director at Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, &lt;span&gt;told HuffPost that another benefit to eating smaller meals throughout the day is that it helps prevent hunger, which is what causes people to make unhealthy food decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 2: Not Getting Enough Protein, Fiber And Other Important Nutrients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating smaller, more frequent meals may lead to less fatigue and unwanted side effects, but Ghanem said that it also can lead to not getting all the required nutrients the body needs. The biggest nutrient deficiency he sees in people taking weight loss medications is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-much-protein-to-eat_l_63a22684e4b0aeb2ace83986" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="protein" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="63a22684e4b0aeb2ace83986" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;protein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Alatassi added to this, telling HuffPost that not getting enough protein can lead to muscle loss and slow metabolism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But protein isn’t the only nutrient deficiency at risk on a weight loss medication. Obesity medicine specialist and bariatric surgeon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doctorkudsi.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jihad Kudsi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.doctorkudsi.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Jihad Kudsi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;told HuffPost that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-not-enough-fiber-digestions_l_66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="fiber" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;fiber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is another important nutrient many people don’t get enough of. When this happens, he said, it can lead to constipation and negatively impact gut health. Other nutrients Kudsi said many people taking a weight loss medication often don’t get enough of include iron (particularly for women), vitamin B12, calcium and vitamin D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To ensure you’re getting all the nutrients your body needs, see a registered dietitian to help you figure out the best way to hit all your nutrient buckets while eating frequent smaller meals. Additionally, Turnquest said it can be helpful to take a daily multivitamin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 3: Consuming Too Much Alcohol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a lot of emphasis on changing food habits after starting to take a weight loss medication, but it’s important to think about your drinking habits too — particularly with alcohol. While drinking alcohol in moderation is OK, Ghanem said, it’s important to avoid drinking too much. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: krisanapong detraphiphat via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;krisanapong detraphiphat via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Alcohol can hinder your body's ability to counteract low blood sugars.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“First, alcohol is a high-calorie drink. Second, alcohol can hinder your body’s ability to counteract low blood sugars. Weight loss medications also lower blood sugars, and this in turn can increase your chances of hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening. Third, alcohol can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, and the medications do as well. This can aggravate those side effects,” Ghanem said. He also added that people with obesity are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987457" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at higher risk for fatty liver disease" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987457" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;at higher risk for fatty liver disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and routinely drinking too much alcohol can be another blow to liver health, increasing the risk of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you do decide to consume alcohol, Alatassi told HuffPost, it’s best to limit intake, stay hydrated and to avoid drinking on an empty stomach. This, she said, can decrease the chances of experiencing the negative side effects that are common with weight loss medications, like nausea and dizziness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 4: Skipping Meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re taking a weight loss medication, you may think that skipping meals can help you get to your goal weight easier. Coupled with the fact that weight loss medications suppress appetite, it can be extra tempting to skip meals. A word of advice straight from the doctors: Don’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Skipping meals can lead to unintended side effects and nutritional deficiencies. While these medications suppress appetite, the body still requires consistent nourishment to maintain energy levels, muscle mass and metabolic health,” Kudsi said. He added that prolonged fasting also can lead to overeating later in the day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alatassi added to this, saying that skipping meals can also increase the risk of muscle loss, which people taking a weight loss medication already are at an increased risk for. “Research has found that skipping meals is linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7832851/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="poorer weight loss outcomes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7832851/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;poorer weight loss outcomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7788749" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="metabolic imbalances" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efe806e4b0bb67eb7abb86" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7788749" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;metabolic imbalances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, further reinforcing the need for a structured eating routine,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: eclipse_images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;eclipse_images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A big meal causes a surge in blood sugar, which then leads to a surge in insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down (resulting in fatigue).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake No. 5: Eating Too Close To Bedtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both Kudsi and Turnquest told HuffPost that one common mistake many people taking a weight loss medication make is eating too close to bedtime. “Eating too close to bedtime, especially high-fat or high-carb meals, can worsen acid reflux, which is a common concern for those on GLP-1 medications,” Kudsi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

Her doctors attributed her death to what they described as “measles pulmonary failure”, noting that she was not MMR-vaccinated and had no reported underlying conditions, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from Texas’s state health services department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She was the second young child from Seminole to die from measles in about five weeks. Kayley Fehr, who was also not given the MMR vaccine, died aged six in February after contracting measles and being hospitalized in Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An unvaccinated adult in Lea county, New Mexico, also died after contracting the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fehr was the first person in the US to die from measles since 2015. Measles had been declared eliminated from the US in 2000, but it has recently been spreading in undervaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Funeral services for Hildebrand and Fehr were held in the same Mennonite church in Seminole, which has a population of about 7,000, according to publicly available information. Many Mennonite communities – which tend to be close-knit – have historically been undervaccinated as they &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prioritize&lt;/a&gt; what they interpret to be medical freedom over vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children who get the MMR vaccine are typically given the first dose at 12-15 months. They usually get the second dose between ages four and six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Respectively, the shots are 93% and 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the US Centers for Diseases Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The west &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; county to which Seminole belongs, Gaines, has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state. Around the time of Hildebrand’s death, it had reported about 300 measles cases since January. That was more than 65% of the nearly 500 measles cases which had then been reported in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of Friday, the US government was reporting more than 605 measles cases across 22 states for the year so far. At least 74 of those cases – roughly 12% – had led to hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma joined Texas as well as New Mexico in having active measles outbreaks, defined as three or more cases, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US reported 285 measles cases in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts have warned that the US’s collective outbreak could continue for several more months, if not for about a year. They have also said the US should prepare for more measles-related deaths without a more aggressive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US Senate’s health committee has summoned Kennedy to testify before the group on Thursday. Despite Kennedy’s well-documented vaccine skepticism, the Senate voted 52-48 to confirm him as the national health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQbTNnT05mWHc4Zi1QeHdwcHNmLWJYWTYyWjJxU3YyaW00NE9ETFVhVm9YQkFJMzBRV05CUEp4NTJRUTBGcTU4WmgtaXJFTG1oQlQ0UG93dFZsS01Cd1ZTZFJ2VUxqVGdGRFBRd09KcnIyeHh5NW1oeU1FUVBkMldUTm1pTXZEbFkwbzgzMA</guid></item><item><title>Melting ice in the Arctic could unleash deadly 'zombie' viruses and trigger a new pandemic, climate scientists - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQRlI4MjFrNEN1czVyNER6RTZpTnJUNG1pTlNXRGVfTk9kc3RCX2R3MzFpRlBuYUMtZFJyekZqTjlNcXNCR3BXVElTYThheXF0NFh3UjQxQnhNMU81NGQzbEx5Xy1Od3RDZlE2bHhJR3hKdGk1X08zZzlocHhvQlQ4alYwN3dfcFB5cWN0VU5TVHhWRWpRQkJDMms2Z9IBoAFBVV95cUxNUDQxNlZXbVo4ejJuR1ZwaEFxektaTXNyMHVvb1pLeVRScVdlVWpObnozUWJ0N2tKMnJBTEg0WVRDdlJHMUZqUXJrQVVObTlHcXQxV3VhbVZ4cDBjdEVxQk9Mb3EySV81eFMycEJuckM3ZlV1NUIxUnhoeEhfRFdWX3FONG1IQWN6ZHdxSVFDeDZkci1iaXpobXpvSzZGalJz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-9f391270-1467-11f0-99f7-97e313d4de36"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; brought the world to a standstill back in 2020, thoughts have turned to what the next global pandemic could be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many scientists are focusing their research on a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14534011/disease-x-warning-pandemic-viruses.html"&gt;hypothetical future 'Disease X'.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to a new study, the answer could actually lie in the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have warned that melting ice at the North Pole could unleash 'zombie' viruses with the potential to trigger a new pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These so-called 'Methuselah microbes' can remain dormant in the soil and the bodies of frozen animals for tens of thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as the climate warms and the permafrost thaws, scientists are now concerned that ancient diseases might infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Co-author Dr Khaled Abass, of the University of Sharjah, says: '&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html" id="mol-a6cc6910-1462-11f0-ac9b-817996f0a7ca"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt; is not only melting ice—it's melting the barriers between ecosystems, animals, and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Permafrost thawing could even release ancient bacteria or viruses that have been frozen for thousands of years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Melting ice and thawing permafrost in the Arctic could release a deadly 'zombie virus' and start the next pandemic, scientists have warned. Pictured: Scientists walk over the thawing Greenland icecap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;So-called 'Methuselah microbes' can remain dormant in the soil and the bodies of frozen animals for tens of thousands of years. Scientists have managed to revive some of these ancient diseases in the lab, including this Pithovirus sibericum that was isolated from a 30,000-year-old sample of permafrost &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Glaciers can also store huge numbers of frozen viruses. As scientists predict that the world's glaciers will vanish by 2100, there are concerns that these ancient pathogens could be released &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For over a decade, scientists known that bacteria and viruses frozen in the Arctic could still have the potential to infect living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2014, scientists isolated viruses from the Siberian permafrost &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/article-6923367/Thawing-Siberian-permafrost-anthrax-prehistoric-diseases-come-life.html"&gt;and showed they could still infect living cells despite being frozen for thousands of years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, in 2023, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12988837/Arctic-zombie-viruses-Siberia-one-day-released-Earths-warming-climate-trigger-new-pandemic-scientists-warn.html"&gt;scientists successfully revived an amoeba virus that had been frozen for 48,500 years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the risks are not limited to permafrost regions, as dormant pathogens can also be found in large bodies of ice such as glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13793979/ancient-viruses-discovered-melting-ice.html"&gt; scientists found 1,700 ancient viruses lurking deep inside a glacier &lt;/a&gt;in western China, most of which have never been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The viruses date back as far as 41,000 years and have survived three major shifts from cold to warm climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these viruses are safe so long as they remain buried in the permafrost, the big concern for climate scientists is that they may not remain that way for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When ice or permafrost is disturbed or melts, any microbes inside are released into the environment - many of which could be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The bodies of frozen animals like mammoths or woolly rhinoceros (pictured) can harbour ancient organisms which survive in a dormant state.

If this happened, there is a serious risk of humans becoming infected by the ancient disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Arctic is an especially dangerous region for zoonotic diseases because health monitoring services are so limited. The researchers point out that diseases like Toxoplasma gondii are already spreading widely through people and animals in the region (illustrated)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of infection could lead to a particularly dangerous and hard-to-control pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Abbas says: 'Climate change and pollution are affecting both animal and human health—our research looked into how these two forces are interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the Arctic warms faster than most other parts of the world, we're seeing changes in the environment—like melting permafrost and shifting ecosystems—that could help spread infectious diseases between animals and people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warn that Arctic regions are an especially dangerous starting point for a pandemic since the region has so little medical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health and research services are limited, meaning a disease may spread widely before the authorities have the chance to react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Already, the researchers point out that zoonotic diseases such as Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever and the parasite Toxoplasma gondii have spread throughout the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Abbas cautions that what is happening in the Arctic 'doesn't stay in the Arctic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The environmental stressors we studied have ripple effects that reach far beyond the polar regions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-982c9580-1460-11f0-ac9b-817996f0a7ca"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-92da8620-0c28-11e8-9ae0-6f3a2e2268ae" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5363711/WHAT-PERMAFROST.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer below the Earth's surface found in Arctic regions such as Alaska, Siberia and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It typically consists of soil, gravel and sand bound together by ice, and is classified as ground that has remained below 0°C (32°F) for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated 1,500 billion tons of carbon is stored in the world's permafrost - more than twice the amount found in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The carbon comes in the form of ancient vegetation and soil that has remained frozen for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If global warming were to melt the world's permafrost, it could release thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because some permafrost regions have stayed frozen for thousands of years, it is of particular interest for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ancient remains found in permafrost are among the most complete ever found because the ice stops organic matter from decomposing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A number of 2,500-year-old bodies buried in Siberia by a group of nomads known as the Scythians have been found with their tattooed skin still intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A baby mammoth corpse uncovered on Russia's Arctic coast in 2010 still sported clumps of its hair despite being more than 39,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Permafrost is also used in the study of Earth's geological history as soil and minerals buried deep in Arctic regions for thousands of years can be dug up and studied today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 10:53:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQRlI4MjFrNEN1czVyNER6RTZpTnJUNG1pTlNXRGVfTk9kc3RCX2R3MzFpRlBuYUMtZFJyekZqTjlNcXNCR3BXVElTYThheXF0NFh3UjQxQnhNMU81NGQzbEx5Xy1Od3RDZlE2bHhJR3hKdGk1X08zZzlocHhvQlQ4alYwN3dfcFB5cWN0VU5TVHhWRWpRQkJDMms2Z9IBoAFBVV95cUxNUDQxNlZXbVo4ejJuR1ZwaEFxektaTXNyMHVvb1pLeVRScVdlVWpObnozUWJ0N2tKMnJBTEg0WVRDdlJHMUZqUXJrQVVObTlHcXQxV3VhbVZ4cDBjdEVxQk9Mb3EySV81eFMycEJuckM3ZlV1NUIxUnhoeEhfRFdWX3FONG1IQWN6ZHdxSVFDeDZkci1iaXpobXpvSzZGalJz</guid></item><item><title>How to track down your childhood vaccination records in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware - WHYY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPVjI2dUJpVmRid3BIMjE1aU5nVHQ1NDUwbEhnM09GR21Ra2pUTEY4dmlmTFFCTHcyUUg3Ri13eU14ZjF3LTJfRW9OSkVrZGFPNklXOHdIc1lVU3BwdkFwbTQ1YjVLY2N4REhHQkxaMUZkLWlvX2lpbE1zS0N3UGs1UTNOVU11WWNLdHVQZGN1Q1FuMTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="flexible-content-container wysiwyg-styles"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, there’s only been a &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/bucks-county-measles-case/"&gt;handful of measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in the Philadelphia region, but peak summer travel season is fast approaching.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts urge people planning to visit areas with &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/measles-virus-contagious-airborne-infection/"&gt;larger infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; outbreaks to check their vaccination status, which may require locating their childhood immunization records.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with your health care provider will definitely help with keeping your records available in centralized areas so that you can make sure that you’re up to date as best as possible,” said New Jersey Department of Health State Epidemiologist Dr. Tina Tan.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vaccines for diseases like hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and polio are given &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html"&gt;during infancy and early childhood&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, those shots are recorded in electronic health records systems, but for many older adults, their vaccine histories were kept in paper files that may have been damaged, destroyed or lost to time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you cannot find your vaccine records, you might need to get some of your vaccines again,” Tan said. “That’s not necessarily ideal, but it is definitely safe to repeat vaccines.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Going straight to the source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things people can try before they consider getting revaccinated. They can first check with their childhood pediatricians’ offices or current primary health care providers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These offices may still have the paper records, or they’ve converted them into digital files.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people have been pregnant, you probably have been tested for certain protection against certain vaccine-preventable diseases, so your obstetrician’s office might also have that information,” Tan said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this might not be an option for everyone. In states like Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, health providers are only&lt;a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf"&gt; required to keep&lt;/a&gt; medical records of former patients for a minimum of seven years after the last appointment. Then, they can be destroyed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other practitioners and offices may no longer be in business.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those cases, Tan said people can check if their childhood vaccine records are on file with schools and colleges that often request documentation for incoming students.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The military, if you were enlisted, might have records of the immunization as well,” she said.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;Reading mainstream media headlines over the weekend, one would think that Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/11/15/rfk-jrs-revenge-controversial-health-secretary-pick-is-payback-for/" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has finally learned his lesson on vaccines. After a second child died in Texas due to a measles outbreak, Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-distorted-vaccine-science1/" target="_blank"&gt;long-time opponent of the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in particular, posted a statement on X declaring, "The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine." This was enough to trigger a cascade of laudatory coverage of Kennedy for meeting the bare minimum of common sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/kennedy-support-measles-vaccine-outbreak-00276021" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy announces support for measles vaccine amid outbreak&lt;/a&gt;," declared Politico's headline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/06/kennedy-measles-vaccine-texas-visit" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy "advocated for the measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine during a visit to West Texas on Sunday," Axios reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"RFK Jr. after Texas visit: MMR vaccine 'most effective' way to prevent measles spread," &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/06/texas-measles-outbreak-second-death/82962586007/" target="_blank"&gt;blared the USA Today headline.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Health secretary RFK Jr. endorses the MMR vaccine," &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" target="_blank"&gt;exclaimed the NPR headline, with the enticing promise&lt;/a&gt; that this is  "stoking fury among his supporters." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big, if true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Kennedy — or someone working for him — technically wrote those words down, those paying closer attention will notice that is not the message sent to the MAGA base by Kennedy's visit to Texas. If one looks past Kennedy's rote words to his actions, a much different picture emerges, and it becomes clear that he thinks vaccines are for weak, lazy parents. Superior parents, Kennedy suggests, toughen kids up by putting them through the measles instead. For one thing, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy spent most of his time in Texas celebrating parents &lt;/a&gt;who refuse to vaccinate, highlighting how many kids they have who didn't die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows efforts by Kennedy's anti-vaccine group, misnamed Children's Health Defense (CHD), to present parents of kids who die of measles as advocates for letting more kids die this way. After the first child died from this outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/20/texas-measles-family-gaines-county-death/" target="_blank"&gt;CHD released an ad featuring the parents of the dead girl &lt;/a&gt;explaining why they're happy with their choices, because they believe "she’s better off where she is now" and falsely claiming the disease made their surviving children stronger. (In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/7353/" target="_blank"&gt;measles weakens the bodies — and especially immune systems &lt;/a&gt;— of its victims.) Kennedy continued the message by arguing that the Mennonites who refuse vaccination are "resilient, hardworking, resourceful, and God-loving people," with the unsubtle implication that people who do vaccinate are less virtuous.&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rfk-jr-touts-bogus-measles-treatment-hours-after-burying-8-year-old-child/" target="_blank"&gt; Kennedy also spent the trip pushing &lt;/a&gt;"healers" as an alternative to prevention, even though the practitioners he cited use dangerous "treatments" that don't work — such as overdosing kids with vitamin A — but are instead &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/04/04/texas-vitamin-a-toxicity-measles-patients/82871895007/" target="_blank"&gt;sending kids to the hospital with liver damage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAGA audience understands that the pro-vaccine message is just what "they" are "forcing" Kennedy to say, and that his anti-vaccine gestures are his real message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this playbook sounds familiar, it should. Donald Trump, who appointed Kennedy to HHS, used the same two-faced strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the same purpose: to trigger headlines portraying him as a responsible steward of public health, while signaling to his followers that they should reject the advice of medical experts. For those who have memory-holed that traumatic period, a short recap: In official channels, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-live-trump-urges-social-distancing-warns-covid-19-could-disrupt-u-s-until-august" target="_blank"&gt;such as the White House briefing room&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/14/trump-urges-americans-to-wear-masks-361836" target="_blank"&gt;during interviews with respectable news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, Trump would playact a science-respecting leader, urging Americans to follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks. But on social media and in his personal behavior, he &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/10/01/lets-tell-the-truth-about-the-pandemic-donald-trump-is-guilty-of-mass-murder/" target="_blank"&gt;would mock masks&lt;/a&gt;, tout fake "cures," celebrate people who refused to follow public health measures and throw indoor rallies and parties. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/10/19/fauci-absolutely-not-surprised-trump-got-covid-he-equates-wearing-a-mask-with-weakness/" target="_blank"&gt;When he inevitably contracted COVID-19 pre-vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, he lied about how sick he was and dramatically flung off his mask on camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump is a profoundly stupid man, but he is clever at being two-faced — a lifetime of practicing fraud will improve anyone's skills — so his strategy worked. The press dutifully reprinted his empty repetitions of the public health advice from experts. Meanwhile, the MAGA base heard his real opinion loud and clear. They dutifully followed his implied instructions to refuse all precautions. Even after he left office, the GOP base continued to show loyalty to Trump by risking sickness, usually by rejecting vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a sinister and probably accidental genius of this say-one-thing-do-another messaging strategy. Mainstream media, especially the kind that fancies itself "objective," prefer words over actions. What someone says can be quoted directly. A person's actions, however, can often have some plausible ambiguity that bad faith actors can exploit to muddy the waters. Kennedy's Texas trip is a good example. MAGA spinsters will read this article, for instance, and insist that I'm falsely interpreting the message of Kennedy's visit with the family, ignoring the fact that MAGA spinsters are in the mentions of that same post, praising his anti-vaccination message. But his empty pro-vaccine quote can be reprinted without getting into a quibble-fest with dishonest actors, making it a lot easier for journalists seeking that gold ring of "objectivity." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-faced strategy also provides the advantage of allowing the MAGA leader to paint himself as a brave truth-teller being suppressed by the mysterious but all-powerful "deep state" forces out to get him. The MAGA audience understands that the pro-vaccine message is just what "they" are "forcing" Kennedy to say, and that his anti-vaccine gestures are his real message. That gives the anti-vaccine message an allure of "forbidden" knowledge, making it even more powerful than if he just came right out and said what he really thinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's anti-vaccination actions aren't just about messaging, though that is bad enough. In his role at HHS, he's been waging war on decades of federal efforts to maintain and improve vaccination rates. Kennedy-aligned leaders at the Centers for Disease Control &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/28/the-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;suppressed a report showing vaccine refusals are behind&lt;/a&gt; the current measles outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/rfk-jr-gives-elon-musks-doge-free-rein-to-raid-the-health-agency/" target="_blank"&gt;Programs at the Food and Drug Administration to roll out&lt;/a&gt; new vaccines — including one to make COVID-19 vaccines less painful — were cut. And Kennedy has ordered a "study" into the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism to &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/cdc-vaccine-autism-study-link-research-geier-rcna198485" target="_blank"&gt;be headed by a disgraced scientist who has peddled lies &lt;/a&gt;about vaccines for decades. Kennedy may not be able to take vaccines away entirely, but he can use his power to make them much harder to get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's Texas trip is a terrible reminder of what a skilled propagandist he is. The message behind the trip was not "get vaccinated," no matter what the headlines say. It was about romanticizing vaccine refusal as courageous resistance against decadent, weak liberalism, which is about as fascist a framing as one can find. It was about normalizing children's deaths as necessary sacrifices for the MAGA cause. Whatever the mainstream media reports, the MAGA base gets Kennedy's message: don't vaccinate. &lt;/p&gt;

                                        Estimated read time: 2-3
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — A large new study adds to evidence that diabetes during pregnancy is linked with an increased risk of brain and nervous system problems in children, including autism, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether diabetes actually causes those problems remains unclear. But when mothers have diabetes while pregnant, children are 28% more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, according to an analysis of data pooled from 202 earlier studies involving more than 56 million mother-child pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks for children of mothers with diabetes during pregnancy were 25% higher for autism, 30% higher for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 32% higher for intellectual disability. They were also 20% higher for trouble with communication, 17% higher for movement problems and 16% higher for learning disorders than in children whose mothers did not have diabetes while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy appeared to confer a 39% higher risk for one or more of these neurodevelopmental disorders compared with gestational diabetes that begins in pregnancy and often resolves afterward, the researchers reported in The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes affects up to 9% of pregnancies in the United States, with the incidence rising, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven of the earlier studies compared affected children with siblings. These analyses did not find an effect from mothers' diabetes, which suggests that shared genetic or familial factors might be contributing to the increased risk, the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings emphasize the importance of medical support for women at risk of developing diabetes and the continuous monitoring of their children, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association of maternal diabetes with autism in offspring is well known, said Dr. Magdalena Janecka, of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, who studies links between in utero exposures and child development but was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large "meta-analysis" like this one allows for analyses of subgroups, such as mothers with preexisting versus gestational diabetes, or children with autism versus those with ADHD or movement disorders, but it cannot prove cause and effect, Janecka said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Meta-analyses allow us to compare groups more precisely. At the same time, they are not bringing us any closer to understanding the causes or the underlying mechanisms," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One woman is sharing the ails of modern dating after seeing a message a man sent her on popular dating app Hinge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
        
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TikToker T Griff (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griff.t32"&gt;@griff.t32&lt;/a&gt;) posted a short clip detailing an interaction she had with a man on &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/hinge/"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt; that went viral. In the video, which accumulated over 2.1 million views on the popular social media application, she says the man informed her he took a honey pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought the product was an athletic supplement. However, she soon learned that this wasn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No because the last time I was on Hinge talking to somebody,” Griff says. “He told me that he just took a honey pack. And I was like, ‘Oh cool, how many miles are you gonna run?’”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;She then pauses and looks into the camera with a blank expression. “I didn’t know what a honey pack was,” Griff says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-honey-pack"&gt;What is a honey pack?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-a-honey-pack"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, honey packs are “falsely advertised” as supplements that promote sexual health. Since they aren’t FDA-approved, the outlet advises against consuming these products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthline also reported that these items contain ingredients that aren’t included on their labeling. Consequently, the website states that individuals may suffer “serious health effects” should they consume them.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Many of these unmentioned materials are often associated with prescription-only drugs. What differentiates over-the-counter medication from those mandated by doctors boils down to risk. For instance, prescription drugs may interfere with other medications. A healthcare professional would be able to assess these conflicts and prescribe appropriate pharmaceuticals accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics-and-health/pharmacogenomics/index.html"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt; play a role in deciding which types of medicine a person can or can’t take. One such undisclosed ingredient found in honey packs is sildefanil, which is the active ingredient in Viagra. The popular Pfizer offering stimulates blood flow and was originally intended for those dealing with heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Viagra was found to induce erections in men and is prescribed to treat those with erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypotension is one such adverse side effect of taking the aforementioned chemical. It can lead to dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, fatigue, and confusion, as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21156-low-blood-pressure-hypotension"&gt;per the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Some have reported other adverse symptoms upon consuming honey packs. Chief among them are allergic reactions, vomiting, anaphylaxis, rash breakouts, uncontrolled sweating, hives, itchy skin, and abnormal swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-is-a-honey-pack#what-they-are"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; writes that many unregulated manufacturers often add other ingredients to honey. Some may include ginseng, bee pollen, and royal jelly. While there are some packs that purely contain natural ingredients, the outlet advises against purchasing those that promise sexual enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@griff.t32/video/7482435799850503455" data-video-id="7482435799850503455"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hinge-horndogs"&gt;Hinge horndogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous folks who responded to Griff’s video were baffled by the man’s decision to share this information with her. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;One was shocked that a man revealed he needed a honey pack to maintain an erection. “The fact that these men are needing these honey packs is embarrassing for them,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another couldn’t believe someone would use one of these over-the-counter sexual enhancement products to use a dating application. “Imagine taking a honey pack to then just scroll through Hinge,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Griff appeared bemused by her response to the man’s honey pack admission, one user thought her reply was appropriate. “No that was the perfect answer to a stranger on Hinge saying that,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone else wondered why there seems to be an uptick in the demand for sexual enhancement items. “I’m curious why so many young men need things like that,” they questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Another woman said that hearing an admission of honey pack usage is a massive turn off. “Okay but why are they so excited to tell us?? Like bro? You’re 40. I’m gonna need a honey pack because of how dry that statement makes me,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Dot has reached out to Griff via TikTok comment for further information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Samples have been used to estimate both the amount and type of viruses shed by the region’s 3.3 million residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started with coronavirus during the COVID-19 pandemic expanded to include MPOX in 2022 and research efforts are underway on using the same genetic analysis techniques to detect influenza, hepatitis and measles and other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_9274835" class="wp-caption alignnone size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SUT-L-wastewater-testing.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="..At UC San Diego campus on Friday, Dec. 3, 2021 in San Diego, CA., postdoctoral researcher, Smruthi Karthikeyan gathers a waste sample from one of the 131 auto samplers on campus that monitor 350 campus buildings.

(Nelvin C. Cepeda / The San Diego Union-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those efforts ground to a halt Monday after researchers received word that the roughly $400,000 per year provided by the county’s public health department would cease, a casualty of an initiative from the Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts to a national “Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity” program run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While other wastewater testing services will still be available, San Diego County’s effort provided more information on the types of viruses circulating in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Louise Laurent, a perinatal research director at UC San Diego, and Kristian Andersen, director of infectious disease genomics at Scripps Research, said Monday that the funding pullback forces SEARCH to stop operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to do one more batch, because we already purchased the reagents,” Laurent said, noting that the lab’s weekly delivery of new samples is now finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurent said that there was an expectation that funding would run out, as the county planned to add wastewater surveillance to its list of ongoing operations, including the special equipment necessary for the operation in its $93 million new public health laboratory in Kearny Mesa that is expected to open in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that they anticipated a gradual transfer of knowledge from the research labs that have been running this highly technical service for years to those at the county who will be responsible for delivering accurate results going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The plan was that we would finish out this year’s contract at the end of August and then there would be an orderly transition where they were going to come back and learn our process from start to finish,” Laurent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that the key would have been to have both UCSD and the county lab processing the same wastewater samples on each organization’s equipment in parallel in order to make sure that results matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of the issue is that this is disorderly,” Laurent said. “Finding out, you know, on a given day that your contract ended a week ago and that there is no transition time and that you are just expected to stop, that’s not the most efficient way to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In an ideal situation, the county lab would have started its in-house program while UCSD was still running in order to create an equivalence between the county data and UCSD’s,” an emailed statement said. “The lab can still stand up a fully functional program in-house without this, but it might be harder to compare data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health services, the county statement added, is “working on the logistics of transferring historical samples from UCSD to the new county lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say, Andersen added, that research agencies plan to just walk away from the county’s effort, though without grant funds, there are limits to what can be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not angry with the county because we know that they don’t want to do this,” Andersen said. “Even without any funds we will continue to help as much as we can in terms of getting the county set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But, to be clear, all of this is because of mandates that come right from the federal government, and specifically those cutting all the funding, not the county itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the situation, the county said in a statement that the existing wastewater testing contract “was paused in light of the federal cuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The county continues to anticipate moving that testing, and related investigation procedures, to the new lab,” the statement said. “In addition, Wastewater SCAN and CDPH (California Department of Public Health) both provide local testing. Public Health Services is grateful for the services UC San Diego and Scripps have provided for this contract and looks forward to continuing a close relationship going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county referenced Wastewater SCAN, a nationwide wastewater analysis project jointly run with philanthropic funds by Stanford University and Emory University in Atlanta. The project lists no indications that it too will shut down. And the California Department of Public Health also regularly publishes wastewater readings for coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s different about San Diego’s SEARCH project is the level of detail made available to the community. Other projects provide regular updates on the total amount of viral genetic material found in wastewater samples, a critical factor in early detection of new outbreaks building in the community. Spikes in the overall number of viruses detected generally correlate with the arrival of a new variant capable of spreading rapidly and quickly causing many new infections. SEARCH goes one step further, using genetic sequencing to determine which subtypes of the virus are causing increases in overall activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is critical to understand because not all variants behave the same, and we need to know which ones are circulating in order to select new variants for future vaccines and, importantly, now which variants could evade the monoclonal antibodies used for treatments and prophylaxis of those who can’t take the vaccine or can’t generate their own immunity,” Andersen said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Alcohol, whether consumed regularly or only on special occasions, takes a toll on your body. From your brain and heart, to your lungs and muscles, to your gastrointestinal and immune systems, alcohol has broad &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohols-effects-body"&gt;harmful effects on your health&lt;/a&gt; – including causing  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="157559" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html"&gt;third-leading preventable cause of cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the US, responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually. In comparison, alcohol-related vehicle crashes cause around 13,500 deaths each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://publications.iarc.fr/Book-And-Report-Series/Iarc-Monographs-On-The-Identification-Of-Carcinogenic-Hazards-To-Humans/Alcohol-Drinking-1988"&gt;early as the 1980s&lt;/a&gt;, researchers suspected that alcohol can cause cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17718399/"&gt;alcohol is causally linked to cancer&lt;/a&gt; of the oral cavity, throat, voice box, esophagus, liver, colon and rectum, and breast. Another study reported an association between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9533-6"&gt;chronic and binge drinking and pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, the US National Toxicology Program concluded that consuming alcoholic beverages is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.22427/NTP-OTHER-1003"&gt;known human carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="157559" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, classified alcohol a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsr2306723"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;, the highest classification indicating there is &lt;a href="https://publications.iarc.fr/Book-And-Report-Series/Iarc-Monographs-On-The-Identification-Of-Carcinogenic-Hazards-To-Humans/Personal-Habits-And-Indoor-Combustions-2012"&gt;enough evidence&lt;/a&gt; to conclude a substance causes cancer in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/alcohol.html#print"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; concur that there is conclusive evidence that alcohol causes several types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials"&gt;US dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; state that even low amounts of alcohol – less than a single drink a day – increase cancer risk. Despite this, many Americans are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/your-favorite-drink-can-cause-breast-cancer-but-most-women-in-the-us-arent-aware-of-alcohols-health-risks-228744"&gt;not aware that alcohol causes cancer&lt;/a&gt;. A 2019 survey found that &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/news/survey-finds-alarming-gaps-in-americans-knowledge-of-major-cancer-risk-factors/"&gt;less than 50 percent of US adults&lt;/a&gt; are aware of the cancer risks of alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics"&gt;over 224 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; ages 12 and older drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime – over 79 percent of people in this age group. Alcohol consumption was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02157"&gt;increasing even before the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting an alarming public health issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QB6G6BQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;I am a researcher&lt;/a&gt; studying the biological effects of moderate and long-term alcohol consumption. My team is working to uncover some of the mechanisms behind how alcohol increases cancer risk, including damage to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom7030061"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/853175"&gt;and the liver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CpBlQg4Nx14?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The US surgeon general called for including cancer risk in alcohol warning labels.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does alcohol cause cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer occurs when cells grow uncontrollably in the body. Alcohol may lead to tumor formation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01563.x"&gt;by damaging DNA&lt;/a&gt;, causing mutations that disrupt normal cell division and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified several mechanisms associated with alcohol and cancer development. A 2025 report from the US surgeon general highlights &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html"&gt;four distinct ways&lt;/a&gt; alcohol can cause cancer: alcohol metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation, alterations in hormone levels, and interactions with other carcinogens such as tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down and eliminates alcohol. When alcohol breaks down, its first byproduct is &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/alcohol-metabolism"&gt;acetaldehyde, a chemical&lt;/a&gt; that is itself classified as a carcinogen. Researchers have found that certain genetic mutations can lead the body to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70019-1"&gt;break down alcohol faster&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in increased levels of acetaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also considerable evidence that alcohol can trigger the body to release harmful molecules called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6668865/"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;. These molecules can damage DNA, proteins and lipids in cells in a process called oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lab has found that free radicals formed from alcohol consumption can directly affect how well cells &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40139-020-00211-z"&gt;make and break down proteins&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in abnormal proteins that promote inflammation that favors tumor formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol can also directly affect hormone levels in ways that increase cancer risk. For instance, estrogens can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-015-0620-1"&gt;increase breast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/94.8.606"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. Moderate alcohol drinking can both &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54737-6"&gt;elevate estrogen levels and promote further drinking&lt;/a&gt;. Alcohol also amplifies breast cancer risk by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-pathol-011110-130303"&gt;reducing levels of vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, a compound that regulates estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who drink and smoke have an elevated risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.cancercenter.com/community/blog/2023/07/smoking-and-drinking-raise-cancer-risk"&gt;cancer of the mouth, pharynx and larynx&lt;/a&gt;. Alcohol makes it easier for the body to absorb the carcinogens in cigarettes and e-vapes. Smoking by itself can also cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mrrev.2021.108365"&gt;inflammation and induce free radicals&lt;/a&gt; that damage DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much alcohol is safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering how much alcohol you can safely drink and avoid harm. If you ask clinicians and scientists, you might not like the answer: none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/alcohol.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials"&gt;American dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend consuming no more than one drink a day for women and no more than two drinks for men. The &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-drinking-patterns"&gt;National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html"&gt;US surgeon general's recent advisory&lt;/a&gt; have similar recommendations to limit alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption is a highly preventable cause of cancer. However, there isn't currently a way to determine someone's personal cancer risk from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person's individual genetic background, lifestyle, diet and other health factors can all &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/health-professionals-communities/core-resource-on-alcohol/risk-factors-varied-vulnerability-alcohol-related-harm"&gt;influence the effects of alcohol on tumor formation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, rethinking your alcohol drinking habits can help protect your health and reduce your cancer risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/245528/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Recently, the limelight has shifted to planetary health diet. The term "Planetary Health Diet" was introduced by the EAT-Lancet Commission in their 2019 report titled "Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems." This commission, comprising 37 experts from 16 countries, was a collaboration between the non-profit organization EAT and the medical journal The Lancet. The concept emphasizes a dietary pattern beneficial for both human health and environmental sustainability, advocating for increased consumption of plant-based foods and reduced intake of animal-based products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is estimated that a widespread shift to this diet form would reduce global dietary emissions by 17% and potentially prevent approximately 11 million deaths a year," the LANCET &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(24)00305-X/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;has said. “Climate change has our planet on track for ecological disaster—use of fossil fuels is the largest contributor, and our food system plays a major role,” said Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition, played a lead role in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What will your food plate look like if you follow planetary health diet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed reference diet—known as the planetary health diet (PHD)—emphasises a shift towards a more plant-based diet, comprised mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, plant protein (ie, beans, lentils, and pulses), unsaturated plant oils, modest amounts of dairy, and small quantities of meat and fish, the LANCET study says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe the Planetary Health Diet is the future of healthy eating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is the planetary health diet superior to other diet forms?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study by Harvard Chan School researchers, people who follow this Planetary Health Diet (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/planetary-health-diet-associated-with-lower-risk-of-premature-death-lower-environmental-impact/#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20that%20the,adherence%20to%20this%20dietary%20pattern." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PHD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) have a lower risk of every major cause of death, including cancer, heart disease, and lung disease. The findings of the study has been published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The researchers used health data from more than 200,000 individuals. Participants were free of major chronic diseases at the start of the study and completed dietary questionnaires every four years for up to 34 years. "The study found that the risk of premature death was 30% lower in the top 10% of participants most closely adhering to PHD compared to those in the lowest 10%. Every major cause of death, including cancer, heart disease, and lung disease, was lower with greater adherence to this dietary pattern," an official statement from Harvard Chan School says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does it support longevity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/Planetary-Health-Diet-and-Mediterranean-Diet-Associated-with-Similar-Survival-and-Sustainability-Benefits" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in April 2025 has shed light on the benefits of this diet form. A cohort study was conducted in Spain to compare the health and environmental benefits of the diet. The planetary health diet involved energy intake of around 2,500 kcal/day and focused primarily on high consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and unsaturated oils; moderate intake of dairy, starchy vegetables, poultry and fish; and low consumption of saturated fats, red meat and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that following this diet form was associated with lower all-cause mortality. Comparing the similarity between Mediterranean diet and planetary health diet, study author Dr. Mercedes Sotos Prieto of the Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain said, "higher adherence to both diets was similarly associated with lower all-cause mortality and with comparable low environmental impact, highlighting the substantial health and planetary advantages of adopting one of these plant-based diets.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Now, let's discuss the shortfalls of this diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LANCET report discusses the antinutritional factors of the planetary health diet. "Appropriate absorption of micronutrients is particularly important in terms of the physiological requirement for iron in women of reproductive age. The bioavailability of certain nutrients in plant-based foods—such as iron, zinc, and calcium—can be lower than in animal source food due to their forms (eg, haeme or non-haeme iron) and antinutrient content (eg, phytates, oxalic acid, and polyphenols)," the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without careful planning, the diet could lead to deficiencies in nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, or omega-3 fatty acids, typically found in animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Importance of Balanced Diet for Health and Wellbeing | Exploring Life's Every DimensionSummary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet leans heavily toward plant-based eating and significantly reduces animal products, which may not align with the traditional eating patterns or cultural preferences of many communities around the world. For populations that rely on animal products for nutrition due to climate, geography, or tradition, this can feel exclusionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 02:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgJBVV95cUxOR0tyMVVpTUlFSFVRT2owekFUSjVVVmgwdkVJVlk3ckZCdFo1dnA4VTFZRU96OGRWM0pSZmhBdXFSZ3UtZnJLdFV0OGdveWp0emVkbW5pSE4zYW5BdGRTNkdMWm9NWDdCSGxVUHZiRlhacVhnZXhweWlSODlNNTA5M2dnRC1WZ2R3X0VZbzlFWlh1XzJ5WE9fWE93R3lCblB0NURacEFFaExkSGpJRUhQMHRTQWVYUnhYaTZyaGZfZ0MzSjNZbDdHM19rTXZYeU95YVlWdE8tX0VWTlJiOTczT2hxSmNNWkhoRGlYYXZCNFh6S3owLUFpS0loRDJNMDBDWV94SDYySnFPaVY0SVE</guid></item><item><title>A Doctor Claimed He Knew Why I Got Cancer.

The show captures the exhaustion and desperation many cancer patients feel, and the seductive allure of ditching traditional medicine for the promise of a “natural” cure. It also exposes the dark underbelly of the alternative health industry — a world where quacks and influencers prey on the vulnerable. They speak with unwavering confidence, yet their claims are backed by zero peer-reviewed evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this all too well ... because I almost fell for it myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in December 2022. I immediately began scheduling consultations with surgeons, but most appointments were pushed to mid- or late January because of the holidays. With weeks to wait, I decided to use the time proactively — or so I thought — and met with Dr. T, an integrative medical doctor, to explore if supplements could support my health while I waited for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. T fully backed my decision to pursue surgery, she mentioned another holistic practitioner, Dr. D, who specialized in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fhealth%2Fbreast-cancer%2Fthermography&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:thermography;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;thermography&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that thermography — a thermal imaging technique that maps blood flow on the breast’s surface — potentially can identify areas of abnormal heat linked to inflammation or tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention, though, was her offhand remark that Dr. D had allegedly “healed” a breast cancer patient without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. As a science writer curious about holistic medicine, I was intrigued. Could thermography detect my cancer? I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Courtesy Jennie Durant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author shortly before breast-conserving surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Dr. D’s office, I noticed that it felt more like a spa than a medical clinic — a welcome change from the windowless rooms with fluorescent lighting where I’d gotten my breast screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thermogram process involved nine thermal images taken with a special camera, followed by a “cold challenge” where I submerged my hands in icy water to test how my body responded. I was told that healthy tissue cools in sync with the brain’s signals, while cancerous or inflamed areas resist the change and show up as hot spots on the thermogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags: thermograms &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fnews-events%2Fpress-announcements%2Ffda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aren’t FDA approved ;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;aren’t FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;as standalone tests for detecting breast cancer, and the technician operating the machine turned out to be the doctor’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waiting for 30 minutes for my results — an eternity that left me uneasy — Dr. D finally called me into his office. And then, things took a bizarre turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he showed me the rainbow-colored thermogram report and acknowledged that it hadn’t detected my cancer — in fact, he seemed visibly flustered by the imaging fail. Instead, it had only revealed “extra heat” in the area, putting me in the “high-risk” category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he revealed his theory: My cancer was caused by “too many COVID vaccines,” and I shouldn’t get another. I was too stunned to respond. Not only is there zero evidence linking COVID vaccines to breast cancer or other “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contagionlive.com%2Fview%2Fmrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turbo cancers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;turbo cancers&lt;/a&gt;,” the claim flew in the face of my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What about the fact that my mom had the same type of cancer, in the same breast, at the same age?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dismissed this outright. “No, it’s definitely the vaccines,” he insisted, before pivoting to his next pitch: Super Mineral Water, a product he sold in his clinic, which he claimed could “detox” my body and possibly help cure me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, I was equally horrified and embarrassed — not just by his quackery, but by my naiveté for walking into this mess. I grabbed my things and left as quickly as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Courtesy Jennie Durant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author ringing a bell after finishing a month of radiation treatment at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my experience, I turned to the internet and stumbled on some comment boards about thermograms. One post led me to the story of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjenniedurant%2Fbreast-cancer-essay&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodmorningamerica.com%2Fwellness%2Fstory%2Fbreast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490&amp;amp;xcust=7851554%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Morganne Delian;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Morganne Delian&lt;/a&gt;, a believer in homeopathic medicine who opted for a thermogram instead of a mammogram to detect cancer when she felt a lump in her breast. The thermogram practitioner reportedly told Delian that he couldn’t see a lump but warned she had “mild to moderate risk of developing aggressive breast tissue.” Months later, after finally undergoing a mammogram and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like Delian’s are chilling reminders of the potential dangers posed by unproven screening tools and alternative therapies.

Part of it, I think, is the allure of control in a moment when you feel paralyzed with terror. A cancer diagnosis strips you of your agency — your body feels like a traitor and your treatment plan is dictated by a team of experts that you’ve just met. Alternative medicine offers the illusion of empowerment and personalized care. Quacks don’t bog you down with statistics, side effects or limitations — they offer hope and simplicity. In a world where cancer treatments are scary or difficult to understand, that simplicity and hope can become irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis, one of the best things I did was learn to trust my cancer team and the science that guided them. I abandoned my wishful thinking — the fantasy of the “lovely healing experience,” like Milla’s tropical Hirsch retreat in “Apple Cider Vinegar.” Instead, I embraced the stark reality of white hospital walls and a windowless operating room, where my surgeon skillfully removed my tumor and left me cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span&gt; Courtesy Jennie Durant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author and her husband at the D.C.

The second case is a 1-year-old in Denver who recently traveled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said Monday they confirmed the case in an unvaccinated Denver County infant resident. They recently traveled with family to an area of Chihuahua, Mexico, which is experiencing a measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was announced in a joint press release from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged Coloradans to check their vaccination status and monitor for symptoms like fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that usually starts several days after exposure on the face and spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at the Denver Health emergency department on Sunday, April 6 from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. may have been exposed, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes after &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-case-pueblo/"&gt;a case was reported&lt;/a&gt; at the end of March, of a Pueblo adult who had traveled to an area of Mexico where there is an ongoing measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infants under 12 months are especially vulnerable to measles because they are typically too young to be vaccinated. This case is a stark reminder that families traveling internationally should delay unnecessary travel or talk to their health care providers about early MMR vaccination for infants, especially when visiting areas with known measles outbreaks,” said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist and deputy chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expressed gratitude to Denver Health and the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment “for their swift action, expertise, and collaboration in identifying this case and protecting the broader community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies normally get the routine dose of measles, mumps, and rubella — or MMR vaccine — at 12 to 15 months. Measles is highly contagious and often severe, but it is a preventable disease. Health officials say the MMR vaccine remains the best protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado’s vaccination rate for measles is &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/"&gt;1 percentage point lower&lt;/a&gt; than needed to reach herd immunity, Herlihy said in a press conference when the first case was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we call the community immunity or herd immunity threshold for measles is about 95 percent. So statewide we are falling short of that. So that does mean that Colorado is potentially at risk for outbreaks,” said the state epidemiologist, Rachel Herlihy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of April 3, 2025, a total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;607 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; were reported nationally, more than other recent years, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to Colorado, cases have been confirmed in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has recorded two deaths this year; in 12 percent of the cases, the person was hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:50:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFAteGNYSjJPUFYtMFZjZTFBS3NhLXQ2cHpiRnpfQkIxUEpfTTF3Sll3VWdmaVA5emlsbHA1ZVN3UExiaVZ0RWZMbVRHclNXWW5SM1JkX3NSeHY4RlJxQXFVOFhkd0JmMVVNTWtpZEVlNDBLaXBDM0pWWEJqdGlPdw</guid></item><item><title>Indiana Department of Health confirms first measles case in 2025 - WLKY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNTk5jTzI1NXAzTlc5bnFpc3NTUmZaSjhURW4yajNpbWFBWXhXS01XbEZLTlRYT3FkcUtuX1laMU9Lb1p2V0hvMlQzZmtsS1V6TTlkTjlSeWpWRm13bjJiM29FVi05dk05WnU5OFhmUjJybkxwNVVsTTFGTFNobUVhZkFmZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processed meats, including bacon, hot dogs and even deli turkey, should be limited to support healthy cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processed meats are typically high in saturated fat and sodium and can negatively affect your gut health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, opt for lean, unprocessed meats and plant-based proteins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cholesterol often gets a bad rap, but it’s not all harmful. In fact, cholesterol is vital for many essential functions, including digestion, hormone production and the synthesis of vitamin D from sunlight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, when cholesterol levels get too high, it can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing your risk for heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The more plaque that builds up, the harder your heart has to work to push blood throughout the body, and the greater your risk of heart attack or stroke becomes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While factors like age and genetics are beyond your control, adopting healthier diet and lifestyle habits can give you some agency over your cholesterol levels. So, what’s the No. 1 food experts recommend limiting to reduce your risk of high cholesterol? Processed meats. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s probably not all that surprising to hear that processed meats, like hot dogs, sausage and salami, aren’t the best for your heart. However, you might not realize that many of your favorite deli meats like turkey, ham and roast beef—which folks tend to think of as healthier—are also included. Read on to find out why it might be time to rethink what you’re putting in your sandwiches.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to lowering cholesterol levels, the key nutrient to limit, surprisingly, isn’t dietary cholesterol but saturated fat.

High saturated fat-containing foods are notorious for causing high cholesterol and increasing levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, specifically,” says &lt;a href="https://carlyinthekitchen.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carly Hart, RD, LN&lt;/a&gt;, a Montana-based registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it may not be surprising to hear that bacon and salami contain saturated fat, Veronica Rouse, M.A.N., RD, CDE, owner of The Heart Dietitian, adds, “Even the ‘healthier’-sounding options—like turkey bacon or low-fat deli cuts—aren’t [necessarily] free of saturated fat; they’re just a bit leaner than regular versions, but still contribute to your total saturated fat intake for the day.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The composition of your gut microbiome is crucial for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;every aspect of your health&lt;/a&gt;, including cholesterol management. Research suggests that diets high in meat, especially processed meats, can reduce the diversity of gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is concerning, as a diverse microbiome plays a key role in regulating cholesterol absorption and excretion.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A well-balanced microbiome may also help reduce &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, a major contributor to the development of heart disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Be Loaded with Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to saturated fat, processed meats are typically much higher in sodium than unprocessed ones. For example, a 100-gram serving of baked turkey breast contains 99 milligrams of sodium, whereas the same-size serving of deli turkey provides a whopping 810 mg of sodium—and that’s before you add sodium from sandwich bread, condiments and other toppings.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sodium—and lots of it—is added to extend the shelf life of processed meats. While preserving meats was once important when people didn’t have freezers and refrigerators, it’s no longer necessary and may be doing more harm than good. While high sodium intake hasn’t been shown to raise cholesterol levels, Hart points out, “A diet high in sodium can increase your risk of developing high blood pressure, causing your heart to work harder,” negatively affecting your overall cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Replacing processed meats in your diet with healthier alternatives isn’t the only strategy for improving your cholesterol levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are tips from dietitians to support better cholesterol levels and overall heart health: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill Up on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; “A great way to combat high cholesterol is to eat a diet high in fiber,” says Hart. “When consuming high-fibrous foods, the fiber binds to the cholesterol molecules to prevent absorption into the bloodstream. High-fiber foods include fruits, veggies, whole grains and oats, to name a few,” she adds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Enough Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; “Another great way to reduce high cholesterol is to consume a diet rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669415/signs-you-might-not-be-eating-enough-omega-3s/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;. These are a ‘good’ type of fat that can help decrease the inflammation that high cholesterol can cause. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish (such as salmon), nuts, avocados and flaxseeds,” says Hart. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Healthier Protein Options:&lt;/strong&gt; While the occasional hot dog or deli meat sandwich won’t entirely derail your heart health, they shouldn’t be on your regular lunch (or dinner) rotation. Instead, Rouse recommends opting for lean, unprocessed proteins, either plant- or animal-based, like grilled chicken, canned salmon or mashed chickpeas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block "&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Top-Rated Cholesterol-Friendly Sandwich Recipes to Try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Trying to lower your cholesterol? It may be time to reevaluate your protein choices. “Many people think grabbing a quick turkey sandwich is an easy way to get protein, but processed meats like these are important to cut back on when you're worried about cholesterol,” says Rouse. In their place, opt for more unprocessed meats, like chicken or fish, or plant-based proteins, like tofu or beans, to keep your cholesterol levels in check.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The patient is recovering, and no other information will be shared to protect their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first case of measles in Indiana since it was detected in a Lake County resident in early 2024, according to IDOH. Health officials say since the disease is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of April 3, the CDC reports a total of 607 confirmed measles cases in 27 states, not including Indiana. Two children have died of measles in Texas, in a growing outbreak that has infected hundreds of people. The Texas Department of State Health Services says a majority of those impacted are from unvaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDOH says measles begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes about 7 to 14 days after exposure. Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at 12-15 months, and again at 4-6 years of age before going to kindergarten, but children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, WRTV spoke with a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.wrtv.com/health/riley-childrens-health-doctor-breaks-down-measles-booster-vaccine-amid-spike" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Riley Children's Health doctor&lt;/a&gt; about the ease with which measles spreads, and declining vaccination rates. Individuals are encouraged to check with their healthcare providers to ensure vaccinations are up to date. Individuals born before 1957 are presumed to be immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jctd2000v2cqxd7bo1bho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is on the ground in Texas for the second time this year, as an ongoing multistate measles outbreak centered in the western part of the state has grown to one of the worst the United States has seen in decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00053b6m464isa6j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC team of three is meeting with state and local officials to assess “the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak,” the agency said, and more staff will be sent once the assessment is complete, after a formal request from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and an order from US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00063b6mlls0mnl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But recent threats confronting public health have made the response to the outbreak more challenging than it may have otherwise been, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00083b6mz0oqz75r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS announced sweeping layoffs last week, including an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts/index.html"&gt;2,400&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. The CDC also pulled back over $11 billion in grants to state and local health departments that were allocated during the Covid-19 pandemic but that local departments say were being used to respond to other public health threats, including the measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00093b6mp6nqc6s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result of federal funding cuts, New Mexico – which has reported 54 measles cases as part of the outbreak – terminated contracts for 20 temporary workers who were helping order vaccines and check vaccination records.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000a3b6mugpo9458@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cuts “resulted in our agency canceling some contracts with community providers that provide outreach to underserved communities relating to vaccination efforts and education,” said Robert Nott, communications director for the New Mexico Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000b3b6mbvgwy84e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Dallas, more than 50 immunization clinics had to be canceled after the cuts, according to Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Some of these outreach efforts were in schools that had low rates of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jjni900033b6ofrdcmsng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dallas County has not reported any measles cases this year, but as other parts of the state prepare for potential spread of the outbreak, Huang warned that his county’s lab testing capacity may be affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000c3b6m1dsef7y2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As local health officials scramble to increase vaccinations, they say they’re seeing a great deal of vaccine hesitancy among communities affected by the outbreak. Yet efforts to understand this hesitancy and what could promote increased vaccination have also been halted, with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/health/vaccine-research-safety-nih-funding/index.html"&gt;at least two dozen&lt;/a&gt; research grants related to those topics canceled in the past few weeks by the National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000d3b6m69zk7t7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The studies that were cut were really focused on improving the preventative care experience and health outcomes for children and for families,” said Dr. Sophia Newcomer, an epidemiologist at the University of Montana whose grant analyzing CDC data on how and when children get vaccinated was terminated last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000e3b6mzjxd52q8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What we see today is a big outbreak of measles, and it’s clear that we need now, more than ever, high-quality vaccination services in every corner of the US.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000g3b6mdvafpli4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Growing vaccine hesitancy has been coupled with a steady decline in trust in public health since the Covid-19 pandemic, which experts say can further hamper the effectiveness of programs and interventions that are central to an outbreak response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000h3b6mt1v2jkwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “State and local health departments often build trust one interaction at a time, and that investment is important because it’s the currency that public health operates with,” said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “The science and data guide us in how to respond to measles outbreaks, but it’s trust, built over time, that can compel people to listen and act on public health guidance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000i3b6mc5tjq42x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just over half of US adults have favorable views of state and public health officials, according to a KFF &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/health/public-health-kff-poll/index.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from January; about 54% said they trust local health officials “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to make the right recommendations on health, down from 64% in June 2023. Key federal health agencies, including the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration, also saw similar dips in public opinion over that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000j3b6m0p02cmvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kansas has reported 24 confirmed cases of measles, which the state health department said may be linked to the outbreak centered in West Texas. But some patients there&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are reluctant to be tested for measles, limiting abilities to capture the full scale and epidemiology of the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000k3b6m4jy9n08c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are encountering individuals that are apprehensive or are resistant to testing. While the reasons for their decision have not been disclosed to our office, these individuals are willing to engage in discussions about their health status and the steps necessary to prevent the spread of measles,” Kerri Ulrich, health department administrator in Kansas’ Kiowa County, wrote in an email. “During an outbreak, we have two key roles: monitoring and assisting those who are ill, and taking steps to prevent the spread of the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000l3b6m3on3fzzr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say it’s important to have a complete epidemiological picture during an outbreak – especially with measles, because it is so contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000m3b6m5181dbnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One person can infect over a dozen others if everyone is susceptible, so it’s really important to understand the epidemiology of who is infecting who, what potential contact locations might have happened, and where there could have been unknown transmission events,” said Dr. Nina Masters, a senior research scientist at the health care analytics company Truveta and former CDC epidemiologist who has responded to a number of measles outbreaks. “Because it’s an airborne pathogen and can stay in the air for two hours after someone leaves a room, it can be very hard at first glance to identify what those contact points might be” without investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000n3b6me85oxz6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And many are raising the alarm that the ongoing outbreak may be significantly bigger than official case counts suggest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000o3b6m7byzfwd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My understanding is that there are many, many, many more cases than are being reported,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases physician in New York City and author of a book warning about the resurgence of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000p3b6m4nq4a2n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 631 measles cases have been reported in the US since the start of the year, according to a CNN tally using data from the CDC and state health departments. There have been dozens of hospitalizations, and two children have died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000q3b6mwb0rta6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, at least 1 in every 1,000 children who become infected with measles may die. At that rate, there are probably now at least twice as many cases as have been reported – and perhaps thousands more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000r3b6mkdff1kwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that the confirmed case numbers that we see are a lower bound,” Ratner said. “They’re almost certainly an underestimate of the actual number of cases, and the fact that we’ve seen two pediatric deaths already makes me worry that there are potentially many more cases than we know of.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000t3b6m0h7jrr78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is highly effective, with one dose offering 93% protection against measles and a second shot raising it to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000u3b6mor4eyvjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But messaging around the importance of the vaccine – and the severity of the situation, in general – has been highly disjointed among various leaders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000v3b6mru5mg7vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has to be an absolutely clear and unambiguous and repeated message to families that what they should do is get their children vaccinated. And we haven’t seen that,” Ratner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000w3b6mazadplwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In February, the Texas Department of Health Services declared Gaines County to be a designated measles outbreak area, invoking &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-vaccination-pep-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new vaccination guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Infants ages 6 months to 11 months are recommended to immediately get an early dose of the MMR vaccine, with two other doses following the regular vaccination schedule: one between 12 to 15 months and one between 4 and 6 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000x3b6m7a20yvyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children ages 1 to 4 who have received a dose should get their next MMR dose immediately, as long as it’s 28 days after their first one, according to the guidelines. Children who have had no shots should also get two MMR doses 28 days apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000y3b6maaeyy82y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By Monday, the state health department had expanded the designated measles outbreak area to include 10 counties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk000z3b6mmsm3q19l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Increasing MMR coverage is a statewide priority. DSHS encourages all eligible individuals to be up to date on MMR vaccination to limit and prevent measles outbreaks,” the agency said in a health alert.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00103b6mfpsmazhy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, the worst year for measles since it was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago, health officials also recommended early doses of the MMR vaccine for infants – and a new &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/first-time-measles-vaccination-trends-us-children-under-24-months/" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Truveta says that there was a bump in vaccinations that year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00113b6mygs9kacf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It shows a positive signal that parents are listening to their providers. They are listening to public health. They’re aware of these travel-based recommendations,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00123b6mb8wj67jh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kennedy’s stance on the MMR vaccine and his messaging around it have been mixed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00133b6mfhnepsck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In March, he wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-rfk-vaccines/index.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; in Fox News that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00143b6mow8g7bre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” he wrote, and parents should consult with health-care providers “to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine” for their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00153b6mrzjstpfq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Sunday, after the death of a second unvaccinated school-age child, Kennedy arrived in West Texas “quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” according to a social media post. In the same post, he wrote that “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00163b6m8b4ojup2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But many experts stress the importance of more direct messaging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00173b6muef2dtd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He still hasn’t said the thing he should say, which is that parents should get their children vaccinated,” Ratner said, and this is more concerning as Kennedy touts the use of vitamin A and the other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html"&gt;unconventional therapies&lt;/a&gt; for measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00183b6mlsia98o4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Kennedy is in a position now where people take his words seriously, and he is in over his head. This is not an area in which he has expertise, and the things that he says can be dangerous,” Ratner said, citing reports&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of children with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt; from too much vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk00193b6mqjb2vz76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people have interpreted his comments to mean that people should use vitamin A to prevent measles. It does not work for that. We do sometimes give vitamin A to children who already have measles, but vitamin A is not the thing that you should be talking about to stop a measles outbreak,” he said. “The thing that stops a measles outbreak is vaccination, which is also the thing that prevents the measles outbreak from happening in the first place.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001a3b6mxv4extoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In March, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/health/cdc-measles-forecast-propublica/index.html"&gt;buried a measles forecast&lt;/a&gt; that stressed the need for vaccinations, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica. Leaders ordered staff to not release an expert assessment that found that the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, ProPublica reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001b3b6m8995vft3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And on Sunday, President Donald Trump downplayed the size of the outbreak and the need for action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001c3b6mncqpb969@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s so far a fairly small number of people relative to what we’re talking about,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001d3b6mze9s8y66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not something new,” he said. “And we’ll see what happens, but certainly, if it progresses, we’ll have to take action very strongly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001e3b6mdbaltgwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The key elements of a successful outbreak response for measles include case identification and investigation, isolating cases and quarantining those with possible exposure, and supporting vaccination, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis, Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001f3b6mu99rjbe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the “backbone” of ensuring that it all works well is trust, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97jdppk001g3b6mjatfgjla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If communities lose that trust in public health, in their health departments, in science, in institutions, it just makes it that much harder for the teams on the ground, for the state and local health departments, for the physicians, for everyone involved in this response,” Masters said.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;An endorsement of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has provoked an angry outcry from anti-vaccine activists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine," Kennedy said in the third paragraph of &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;a lengthy post&lt;/a&gt; on the social media platform X. Kennedy made the post following meetings on Sunday in Gaines County, Texas with the families of two children who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354181/second-child-dies-from-measles-in-texas-as-outbreak-spreads" target="_blank"&gt;have died&lt;/a&gt; of measles during a recent outbreak in the state. He also said he had instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to "supply pharmacies and Texas run clinics with needed MMR vaccines," along with other medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's endorsement is in line with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;all available scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; on the MMR vaccine. "A single dose is roughly 93% effective at preventing illness, and the second dose gets that up to 97%," says Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, just 10 of the 481 measles cases recorded &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;as of April 4&lt;/a&gt; were in partially or fully vaccinated individuals — that's around 2% of all overall cases. So far three unvaccinated people, the two children in Texas and &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" target="_blank"&gt;an adult&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico, have died from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm delighted to hear what Secretary Kennedy has said about giving the vaccination," says Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a retired professor of pediatric infectious disease. Edwards said she'd hoped for an explicit endorsement of the vaccine much earlier in January but that "it's better late than never."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Kennedy's suggestion that the vaccine was effective infuriated several members of the anti-vaccine community who responded on X to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Anti-vaccine anger&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry, but there is no defense for this poorly worded statement," wrote Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/02/14/1077689734/as-state-medical-boards-try-to-stamp-out-covid-misinformation-some-in-gop-push-b" target="_blank"&gt;once claimed&lt;/a&gt; during a legislative hearing in Ohio that the COVID vaccine could cause patients &lt;a href="https://x.com/Tylerjoelb/status/1402288748575002632" target="_blank"&gt;to become magnetized&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to stick "spoons and forks" all over their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who supported Kennedy's presidential run and recently co-founded a non-profit with him called MAHA Action, also questioned the health secretary's endorsement. Bigtree suggested that Kennedy's post had "got cut off." He then went on to make unproven claims about vaccines and autism, and linked to a documentary he had made on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We voted for challenging the medical establishment, not endorsing it," &lt;a href="https://x.com/MdBreathe/status/1909059321326973356" target="_blank"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, a Texas-based physician who has opposed COVID vaccines and is currently fighting a complaint from Texas's medical board over hospital admitting privileges. Bowden says the complaint is related to her prescribing patients ivermectin. Ivermectin is an unproven &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/30/1089809588/ivermectin-covid-treatment-brazil-study" target="_blank"&gt;alternative therapy&lt;/a&gt; for COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Kennedy was one of those candidates that attracted people who might not vote for Trump," Bowden told NPR in an interview. Much of the attraction was from people who were "very fed up with what happened during the pandemic," she says. "Neither Biden or Trump were willing to even talk about the pandemic, and Kennedy was," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58795" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;She says that Kennedy's decision to endorse the MMR vaccine to control the outbreak reminds her of the heavy-handed response to COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Do we need to make a proclamation, 'Ok, this is what needs to be done'?" she says. "That's what rubs me the wrong way."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's statement also contradicts years of his own vaccine skepticism. The health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;formerly chaired&lt;/a&gt; an anti-vaccine non-profit called Children's Health Defense that, during a measles outbreak in 2019, tried to sue New York over the state's school vaccine requirement. It ultimately lost the case. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2023, during &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1999-robert-kennedy-jr/id360084272?i=1000644538873" target="_blank"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with the popular podcaster Joe Rogan, Kennedy denied that the measles vaccine had led to a drop in deaths. He claimed that malnutrition was the root cause of measles deaths, and that by the time the vaccine debuted in 1963, mortality was already low. The few deaths that did occur "were all kids in the Mississippi Delta, black kids, severely malnourished, and they were dying of measles," he told Rogan. Kennedy did not cite any evidence for that claim.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his new role, the health secretary has occasionally acknowledged the efficacy of the MMR shot. "Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons," he wrote &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;in an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News on March 2. But in the same post, Kennedy claimed vitamin A can "dramatically reduce measles mortality." Offit says vitamin A does not affect the disease course in developed nations like the United States, and that it can damage children's livers in large doses. Texas Public Media reported that several children in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with vitamin A toxicity following his Fox News statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Alternative Therapies&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was unclear why Kennedy chose this moment to explicitly endorse the MMR shot. The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to NPR's request for a comment. In &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank"&gt;a second post&lt;/a&gt; later Sunday evening, Kennedy posted pictures posing with the families of those who had lost children, and promoted two therapies, "aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Budesonide is an inhaled steroid used to treat asthma and has "no role in measles," Offit says. Clarithromycin is an oral antibiotic, but Offit says it's the wrong kind of antibiotic for treating secondary bacterial infections caused by measles. "Both of those things are valueless," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Offit says that, despite Kennedy's online endorsement, he expects the measles outbreak to continue and possibly worsen. "This is a massive outbreak that is not being controlled," Offit says. Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but it is killing children again. "I have never been more upset; it's just so hard to watch this."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR's Selena Simons-Duffin and Rob Stein contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers observed plasticity in thalamic neurons in response to visual experiences, independent of the cortex—an unexpected finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes, especially pronounced during development but also present in adults, may offer a new target for treating neurodevelopmental disorders. By focusing on the thalamus, therapies could influence brain-wide connectivity more efficiently and potentially enhance cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Plasticity:&lt;/strong&gt; The thalamus can rewire its own connections without input from the cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Thalamic plasticity is most prominent early in life but still possible in adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting thalamic neuromodulators may help treat conditions like autism by altering sensory processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Years ago, as a neurology resident, Chinfei Chen, MD, PhD, cared for a 20-year-old woman who had experienced a very small stroke, affecting only the thalamus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was so tiny that she wouldn’t have noticed any symptoms had the stroke been in any other area of the brain,” says Chen, who is now an investigator at the F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But she lost her ability to form new memories. I could talk to her for hours, leave the room, come back, and she wouldn’t remember me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex and hippocampus are traditionally viewed as the key structures in memory, but in this patient, these areas were undamaged. The experience made Chen curious to learn more about the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108455"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-memory-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Newer technologies that can selectively activate and monitor cells are now affording a better glimpse of the thalamus. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located deep in the brain, the thalamus is the brain’s central relay hub, receiving information from the outside world and transmitting it to many areas of the cortex. Perhaps because it’s harder to access, it’s been underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chen thinks the thalamus is critical to cognitive function, especially during early development when brain connections are first forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuronal connections — and the ability to update them as needed — have mainly been studied at the cortex level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study just published in the journal&lt;em&gt; Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, Chen and her colleagues show that the thalamus can update its own connections, independently of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying connections in the thalamus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer technologies that can selectively activate and monitor cells are now affording a better glimpse of the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been an explosion of studies of smaller and deeper brain areas that were not well studied before,” says Takuma Sonoda, PhD, in the Chen Lab, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers placed mice in a controlled visual environment, presenting them with horizontal lines moving in different directions (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then recorded the activity of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the part of the thalamus that relays visual information to the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recordings showed that cell populations within the LGN changed their response patterns based on the animals’ visual experience. This finding was unexpected as plasticity, the ability of neuronal connections to change, has traditionally been attributed to the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Providing different experiences can change the connectivity of the thalamus, and these changes in connectivity can be long-lasting,” explains Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was especially true during development, but we also saw plasticity in adult mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the circuits that changed were those connecting the retina to thalamus, &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;those connecting the cortex to thalamus— evidence that the thalamus was rewiring.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new angle on neurodevelopmental disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen believes her team’s findings are relevant to children with neurodevelopmental disorders, which often involve altered brain connections. Some therapies — such as repetitively exposing children with autism to different situations to get them accustomed to them — may be changing these connections, strengthening certain pathways over others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to alter connectivity across many cortical areas, it may be beneficial to intervene at the level of the thalamus, before signals are broadcast throughout the brain,” says Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests that one way to influence connectivity in the thalamus is by modulating neurotransmitters, using existing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neuromodulators could alter the processing of sensory information including visual processing, which can be affected in neurodevelopmental disorders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of studies are looking at expression patterns of neuromodulatory receptors on thalamic neurons, and it’s possible we could find pharmaceuticals that are more specific to the thalamus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus may also be a more strategic target to focus on in improving cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you could change connectivity in the thalamus before information is transmitted throughout the rest of the brain, you could target one place rather than multiple areas of the brain. The thalamus is a very key area of the brain that shouldn’t be neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroplasticity and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3852575d54545d1642594b54574f785b5051545c4a5d564b1650594a4e594a5c165d5c4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joelle Zaslow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://childrens.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Joelle Zaslow – Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Experience influences the refinement of feature selectivity in the mouse primary visual thalamus&lt;/a&gt;” by Chinfei Chen, et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience influences the refinement of feature selectivity in the mouse primary visual thalamus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons exhibit selectivity for specific features: a property essential for extracting and encoding relevant information in the environment. This feature selectivity is thought to be modifiable by experience at the level of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate that selective exposure to a feature during development can alter the population representation of that feature in the primary visual thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thalamic plasticity is not due to changes in corticothalamic inputs and is blocked in mutant mice that exhibit deficits in retinogeniculate refinement, suggesting that plasticity is a direct result of changes in feedforward connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, experience-dependent changes in thalamic feature selectivity also occur in adult animals, although these changes are transient, unlike in juvenile animals, where they are long lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results reveal an unexpected degree of plasticity in the visual thalamus and show that salient environmental features can be encoded in thalamic circuits during a discrete developmental window.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 21:31:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE11cHZOUGJabmMxam1qekJPOWUzT290VmxsUEZuNndzNUlRb3BJRHVSejJnZjhuTklmUkp5b0RrNDJyaGlnekJQZGJIWXdjeUlKNHAwVTYtSnRnWXRHNnBBX3NYWUZGWUxITUZGa1JTMzJ6U2NtRUE</guid></item><item><title>I'm a hospice nurse and I know people see heaven and their dead loved ones before they die - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOa2RKX2M2TUpQNGdUT2FxUGtrRHkxbjNVcm9tcXlGbG5pMEN0aF9HZFNXVXd0RzMwaDFkZzgzV0FUYmU1enRrM3B2WkRDeTBnMWUtdTVmQWRaT3l4bm1URmdTTl9vMGxpN2VaanZ6cExaanhOZkdBSmRkTGE5WG1PektTRU10VGRyOVRXc0VIRmNHMEVUbGhHNHdmbzRwUWVZZ0NfcHBySdIBrAFBVV95cUxQMVMtU0xJXzUwZFBSQjZTcnV6SXhuTk5PN3BiSUFOa1dKSWF4TWFOczRLWlU3WDFkbXJQREFoVHBUVHBfbGxGU2pLUEQwR3cyNnZDZUc2ZFo5VlUwSTlLNUlXYWJrdEFiOERMelNabDF0ZmM4SXR4QVZwZURfM2VndnZ0Z2xFTGx0UUh1LUNIYVh0a0hQa2ZhTk9wM1FKTk9SMlVqQU0zdVlYSjhH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A hospice nurse has revealed why she is convinced people see heaven and their passed loved ones before they die.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Julie McFadden, 42, a registered nurse based in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-b912a740-13d3-11f0-86fe-0dfb1a745437"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; who specializes in hospice care, has built a social media following of millions through sharing her insights in a bid to help &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13907689/scientists-state-life-death-neuroscientist-experience-unbearably-intense-icy-blue-light.html"&gt;destigmatize the process of &lt;/a&gt;death and dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After almost two decades of working with dying patients, Ms McFadden says she has witnessed dozens of paranormal and spiritual experiences where terminal patients seemingly are able to communicate with the afterlife before their own passing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One phenomenon she touches on is called 'visioning,' also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12129221/I-died-40-seconds-coming-life-whats-side.html"&gt;known as deathbed visions&lt;/a&gt;, which is when a person who is dying begins to see people or things that aren't physically present in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a dying person experiences visioning, Ms McFadden says it usually begins somewhere around three or four weeks before their death. She says she sees visioning as much as 80 percent of the time in the dying process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These visions commonly include deceased family members, such as parents, spouses, siblings or even grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Religious figures such as angels, Jesus, Muhammad or God can appear, Ms McFadden reveals - as can beloved pets who have died. &lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;eyond people and animals, visions of beautiful landscapes or images have also been reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Closely related to visioning is another phenomenon, which Ms McFadden refers to as the 'death stare' or the 'death reach'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nurse Julie McFadden has heard voices and seen visions while caring for the dying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one or two weeks before death, Ms McFadden reveals that a dying person will sometimes begin to look past everyone, staring at the wall, the ceiling, the corner of the room, or somewhere far off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They often won't look away from that point for a long time. This staring is often accompanied by the person lifting their arms, reaching out to something or someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one video she spotted online and uploaded by @rugersmomma1, Ms McFadden says one elderly lady in hospice care can be seen having a deathbed vision as she tries to reach out in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining what is happening in the footage, which was shot during the night, the nurse says: 'So what is going on in that video? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'First off, [it's a] classic example of the death reach. Okay, the death reach and the death stare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Probably her staring off and visioning, because this woman is talking to someone that we can't see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's clearly seeing someone, something we can't see. And she says "okay" in the video.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the video, the voice of someone who is not seen in the room was also captured, whispering the word 'mamma'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman who captured the video believes this voice came from her younger sister who died in 2017 and she called out from beyond the grave to greet her dying mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another video, shared by one of Ms McFadden's followers, a similar thing can be seen happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An elderly woman, who was filmed by her daughter, can be seen having a vision two weeks before passing away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms McFadden explains that the daughter said she could hear her mom in the bedroom 'talking to a bunch of people [but] couldn't hear the other people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In one video she spotted online and uploaded by @rugersmomma1, Ms McFadden says one elderly lady in hospice care can clearly be seen having a deathbed vision as she tries to reach out in the darkness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the footage, the nurse says the woman is 'clearly really excited that she is finally seeing these people again' as her voice becomes more animated and she raises her hands to communicate with people not seen in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms McFadden says that deathbed visions are 'important, because they show over and over again that death can be peaceful'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'They show that our loved ones aren't suffering as they die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On the contrary, many of them are having beautiful visions, meeting with long-dead loved ones, or having spiritual experiences in line with their deeply-held beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are not rare occurrences either. Whether we're talking about visions, pre-knowledge of death, seeing bright lights or angels or other phenomena, a significant number of people seem to experience them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While medical professionals still can't adequately explain why most of these phenomena happen, they occur so often that Ms McFadden reveals that they are actually included in hospice textbooks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In medical and scientific texts, they are referred to as either death-related sensory experiences (DRSE) or simply deathbed phenomena (DBP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms McFadden concludes: 'What I also find interesting is that, most of the time, my hospice patients who have these experiences know that the person they're seeing is dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're not in an altered state where they think the person is alive and in the room, and they're often just as curious as I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're alert when it's happening, fully understanding that no one else can see or hear what they're seeing and hearing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:56:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOa2RKX2M2TUpQNGdUT2FxUGtrRHkxbjNVcm9tcXlGbG5pMEN0aF9HZFNXVXd0RzMwaDFkZzgzV0FUYmU1enRrM3B2WkRDeTBnMWUtdTVmQWRaT3l4bm1URmdTTl9vMGxpN2VaanZ6cExaanhOZkdBSmRkTGE5WG1PektTRU10VGRyOVRXc0VIRmNHMEVUbGhHNHdmbzRwUWVZZ0NfcHBySdIBrAFBVV95cUxQMVMtU0xJXzUwZFBSQjZTcnV6SXhuTk5PN3BiSUFOa1dKSWF4TWFOczRLWlU3WDFkbXJQREFoVHBUVHBfbGxGU2pLUEQwR3cyNnZDZUc2ZFo5VlUwSTlLNUlXYWJrdEFiOERMelNabDF0ZmM4SXR4QVZwZURfM2VndnZ0Z2xFTGx0UUh1LUNIYVh0a0hQa2ZhTk9wM1FKTk9SMlVqQU0zdVlYSjhH</guid></item><item><title>N.J. is tracking 3 measles cases.

Kennedy Jr. on February 25, 2025. (Photo by Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For vaccine opponents, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s appointment as secretary of health and human services represented something close to nirvana. It was a chance, finally, to take on Big Pharma and to bring their long-stigmatized beliefs into the political mainstream. Perhaps no one in the country has done more than Kennedy to convince people not to vaccinate themselves or their children. Now, he was going to be in charge of the country’s vaccine programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those dreams came crashing down Sunday afternoon, when Kennedy visited the family of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak for a trip that was billed as an effort to better understand the federal response to the disease. Buried near the bottom of an X post about his visit, Kennedy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" rel&gt;conceded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the measles vaccine is “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.” He also said the government was providing “needed MMR vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That statement went off like a bomb in MAHA-land, where it’s taken as scripture that basic sanitation and vitamin A are the real way to avoid measles, which (they add) isn’t that serious of a disease anyway. The replies to Kennedy’s tweet filled up with former supporters, prominent and not, who thought he had made a grievous error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is no defense for this poorly worded statement,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/BusyDrT/status/1909006120297124009" rel&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Sherri Tenpenny, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36YX9NM" rel&gt;called&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; concern about the measles outbreak “hysteria.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy has a long history of criticizing the measles vaccine, which—to be abundantly clear—is empirically effective and may well constitute one of the great medical breakthroughs of the twentieth century. He said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1896700481579204635" rel&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; recently released by his Children’s Health Defense group that it’s possible the measles vaccine is causing more deaths than measles itself. He’s been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/opinion/rfk-jr-vaccines-samoa-measles.html" rel&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for fueling anti-MMR vaccine sentiments in Samoa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/" rel&gt;before and during&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a fall 2019 measles outbreak that ended up killing 83 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As recently as last month, Kennedy did an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity at a Steak 'n Shake where he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/wheres-the-beef-tallow" rel&gt;expounded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on the supposed dangers of the measles vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, Kennedy’s supporters were already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/rfks-flip-flop-on-the-measles-shot-is-ripping-the-anti-vax-world-apart/" rel&gt;growing restless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in early March, when he wrote an op-ed amid the measles outbreak saying the vaccine should be available to people who want it. Given his previous claims that the vaccine was actually harmful, they wondered, why would he now want to make it available?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others groped for conspiracy theories to defend Kennedy. Kim Iversen, a former host of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s daily talk show, speculated on her own show in March that nefarious forces were deliberately spreading the measles in Texas to make Kennedy look bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Did somebody go and release measles?” she &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6q2vkk-shocked-betrayed-rfk-jr.-flips-on-measles-vaccine-nato-trap-europe-could-dr.html" rel&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As early as December 2024, Dr. Mary Bowden, a Houston doctor who was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suspended-texas-doctor-promoted-ivermectin-covid-treatment-resigns-hos-rcna5833" rel&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from her job for pushing COVID-19 misinformation, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/TheRiftTV/status/1908261647002591606" rel&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on a podcast that Kennedy was ditching attacks on vaccines for the more politically palatable, blander “Make America Healthy Again” movement. She and other anti-vaccine activists worried that he and the incoming Trump administration would be more preoccupied with eliminating “Red Dye no. 4” and seed oils from the food supply than on going after vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“He’s our nuclear bomb—we’re in World War III, he’s going to take down Japan,” Bowden said in the podcast interview. “All of a sudden, the nuclear bomb—the target has shifted to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fury has only grown now that Kennedy managed to eke out one wholly positive statement about vaccines—whether because of bad press or because the death of a second child during the outbreak brought about his Damascene conversion. Former One America News host Liz Wheeler, whose YouTube channel has more than 400,000 subscribers, accused Kennedy of no longer being “based.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What on earth is going on with Bobby Kennedy,” Wheeler &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1909078816007536827" rel&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a post on X. “We voted for based. We didn’t vote for ‘needed MMR vaccines.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This brewing discontent with Kennedy among the MAHA faithful is also one of the forces behind the obviously fake but increasingly popular “RFK blackmail” conspiracy theory I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/when-owning-the-libs-matters-more-than-the-constitution-trump-third-term-maga-republicans-daily-wire" rel&gt;touched on last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In this telling, Kennedy only stopped being “based” because someone—presumably Israel—is blackmailing him with some unspecified but damaging material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is flimsy stuff even by the standards of these conspiracy theories—but if Kennedy continues to acknowledge the reality of the measles outbreak and the value of vaccines, I think it’ll become even more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=5e5ef02e&amp;amp;utm_content=160810591","text":"Get 30 day free trial","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=5e5ef02e&amp;amp;utm_content=160810591" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get 30 day free trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff79dd5c-73c8-497d-aae5-f3859757e421_4475x2983.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;Virginia Lt.

Mothers who faced early trauma were more likely to have children who reported similar experiences and to exhibit traits of neurodevelopmental conditions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such link was found for fathers, possibly due to differing caregiving roles or underrepresentation in the study. The researchers call for more holistic assessments that consider family history when supporting children with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Mothers with difficult childhoods are more likely to have children with ADHD or autism who report similar early-life adversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Paternal Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Fathers’ childhood experiences did not show the same association, possibly due to differing roles or sample size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supportive Care Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Screening parents for ACEs may improve understanding of a child’s challenges and inform more comprehensive support strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult childhood experiences of mothers, rather than fathers, appear to have a negative impact on children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been shown in a study conducted at the University of Gothenburg. The researchers call for a broader approach and more parental support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108447"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mom-trauma-ADHD-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Moreover, these mothers had an increased risk of having traits of ADHD and autism themselves. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examines the association between parents’ adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism. These ACEs include abuse, neglect, and familial dysfunction, which can lead to long-term trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results have been published in the &lt;em&gt;Nordic Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother of the child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 86 mothers and 37 fathers, along with 48 children diagnosed with ADHD, autism, or both, recruited from two psychiatric clinics in Sweden. Mothers who experienced difficult circumstances in childhood were more likely to have children who reported similar experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these mothers had an increased risk of having traits of ADHD and autism themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a mother has grown up in an unsafe environment, this can affect the way she manages stress, provides security, and builds intimate relationships with her child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This, in turn, can make it more difficult for the child to regulate their emotions and deal with everyday challenges, especially if the child has a neurodevelopmental disorder,” says Maria Davidsson, doctoral student at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg affiliated with the university’s Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fathers, on the other hand, no such association was seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we can’t say why this link is only seen with mothers, perhaps it could be due to the mother more often having an intimate caring relationship with her children. It could also be that the fathers’ childhood experiences affect the children in other ways without any direct link to their mental health,” says Maria Davidsson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible reason why the same association was not seen with the children’s fathers could be that fewer fathers participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the bigger picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say it is important to consider the bigger picture when assessing children with ADHD and autism. Looking into the parents’ childhood experiences, such as via ACE screening, can help provide a better understanding of how early experiences impact child development and the family’s need for support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurodevelopmental problems rarely occur alone. Instead, they’re often linked to other factors, making it important to consider the entire context in assessments and interventions alike,” says Maria Davidsson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD, ADHD, and childhood trauma research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e29290879191a291838a8e8590878c918983cc8597cc9187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elin Lindström&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gu.se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elin Lindström – University of Gothenburg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2025.2469737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adverse childhood experiences in children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents&lt;/a&gt;” by Maria Davidsson et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nordic Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse childhood experiences in children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e176"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events associated with negative health outcomes. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are at increased risk of ACEs, however, research on ACEs in children with NDD and their parents, and its possible relation to child problems, is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore the association between ACEs in parents and children; if there is an association between parental ACEs and NDD traits, and if ACEs in parents or children are associated with the child’s emotional behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e179"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 86 mothers, 37 fathers, and 48 children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), recruited from two child psychiatric clinics in Sweden. Parents provided demographic information and reported their own ACEs, NDD traits, and their children’s emotional and behavioral problems. Children responded to measure of ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e182"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal ACEs were significantly correlated with child ACEs (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.382, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.034), as well as with maternal ADHD traits (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.451, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and ASD traits (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.451, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Child ACEs also correlated with child emotional problems (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.304, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.038). Regression analysis revealed a relationship between maternal ACEs and child emotional and behavioral problems (&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; = 0.511, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.036). None of these associations were found in fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e217"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the need for ACE screenings in evaluations of children with ADHD/ASD and suggests clinicians to consider maternal trauma and maternal NDD traits. Future research should explore paternal involvement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:27:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE95bEhfeTJiZUVDZkJrdk5OOXluMFM2OHFxRHI1cDREeGdRclJiRXZKcHBCQWs1aUhwMG5vWnk1VFY5SlhOc3pJNXFLYXlGY2p1T0lYSUNBTFdoZVBLRnNSVlFlQmNGd9IBa0FVX3lxTE5FMzdmSHF1QkJYVThCa01DMlFRNXJEb3lCZU5FRkI2MDNSRDBZR0t3a0JEMWNwNG1FT2FJbzY3NmdfWGZzdVBXVDdaT3BIRV9CT213eHZPQVVabGJXcE8wSS1uRzhoTlY0RmRn</guid></item><item><title>The global fight against HIV/AIDS, in chaos - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPc1VxRlNTamZqcGlibjhfSV9yUG9QLTNveUMwb0tiNlBUTDhDS05vSWU3RVI0ZlBUSmFaR3drVVpJcDRabEZvUmpSV0ZZRXVXZE4zbWlBSVd6dnZoTGRWbmRxaW1BbGs4bXFMQWVUSFdNNXlDS0N2NWFNWExmQXBKTnhHdUFKNk1JQllTX1hNTTlVOEszdHZ4NENvUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Episode_episode-description__mlBrI Episode_episode-content-wrapper__8Q2oZ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within hours of taking office in January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order freezing nearly all foreign aid.

suggests there is a way to counteract the dangerous tiny particles — by eating any 'deeply colored fruit or vegetable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a review of 89 studies, they said certain foods — such as black beans and blueberries — contained anthocyanins, a powerful antioxidant behind dark blue, red, purple or black pigments in fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anthocyanins act as antioxidants in the body, they said, removing free radicals — volatile molecules — that can be released by microplastics and damage cells in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reviewing the research, Dr Angelo Falcone — an integrative medicine physician who was not involved in the research — told &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.foodandwine.com/anthocyanins-fruits-vegetables-microplastics-11709874"&gt;Food and Wine&lt;/a&gt;: 'The general rule is, the deeper and more vibrant the purple, blue or red color, the higher the anthocyanin content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Berries are superstars, particularly blueberries, blackberries, cranberries, raspberries, and bilberries, but other excellent sources include black rice, purple corn, red cabbage, purple sweet potatoes, red grapes, pomegranates and acai berries'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts suggested that deeply colored fruits and vegetables could help to limit damage to the body from microplastics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anthocyanins are water-soluble antioxidants responsible for fruits' and vegetables' deep hues, such as reds, purples, blues and blacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These antioxidants are capable of neutralizing free radicals released by microplastics — limiting their damage to the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Free radicals released by microplastics can enter cells and cause damage to DNA or other cell structures, which may trigger a rise in inflammation levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics enter the body either directly by consuming foods that are contaminated with them or through the skin via contact where they travel into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once in, they enter cells where they can damage DNA and disrupt hormones — raising levels of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say microplastics are a source of oxidative stress, or an imbalance of free radicals in the body linked to cell damage and chronic illnesses like heart disease, as well as hormone imbalances and fertility problems in both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce microplastics levels in the body, experts recommend&lt;span&gt; purchasing fewer foods in plastic packaging, not using or reheating food in plastic containers, limiting the use of single-use plastics like cutlery and avoiding plastic kitchen tools like cutting boards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fruits and vegetables are already recommended as a way to limit damage to the body because of their high antioxidant content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in the review, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9952726/"&gt;Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis&lt;/a&gt; — and first reported by &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.foodandwine.com/anthocyanins-fruits-vegetables-microplastics-11709874"&gt;Food and Wine &lt;/a&gt;— researchers have now suggested certain foods can also help to limit damage to the body from microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anthocyanins are present in many fruits and vegetables, particularly those with red, purple and blue colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say the deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the more anthocyanins they likely contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Showing how anthocyanins could help, the Chinese scientists cited a 2022 study on rats who had ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal disease that causes rectal bleeding, anemia and severe dehydration among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper, the rats were fed a supplement of&lt;span&gt; Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin common in black rice and black beans, and had their sperm count and testicular health tracked. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that by the end of the weeks-long study, the rats had boosted sperm counts and reduced testicular damage — which the reviewers said suggested anthocyanins had improved their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another paper from 2023 that they cited, researchers monitored cells in a lab that made testosterone.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each cell was exposed to a substance that mimics free radicals thought to be released by microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are unavoidable in the modern world, and may have found their way into almost everything we eat and drink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then exposed to four different anthocyanins, with results showing the cells then had reduced oxidative stress and better testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside (C-3,5-G) — found in pomegranates and red apples among others — was found to be the most potent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also reviewed studies they said suggested anthocyanins boosted female reproductive health that were both carried out in animals and in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't clear how much anthocyanin someone needs to consume to get the benefits, but previous research has suggested it is about 50 milligrams per day — equivalent to one cup of blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the research included in the study was carried out in the lab or in mice, suggesting further research is needed in humans to assess whether these can help to reduce suspected damage from microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nonetheless, fruits and vegetables are considered a cornerstone of a healthy diet because of the nutrients, fiber and antioxidants that they contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current US dietary guidelines recommend that Americans consume five-a-day — typically two fruits and three vegetables daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQd3dPTFBKUHlHVXE5TjVIbUtScWNsRjh1MnpidXJySEhwZmt2cHNWZFdWX0JZVGJxM0NkM1lUWENWNGRnX2xaNlhlRnNnZjF0UksxLUV4aF9QeE1JMlpIaFhvQVVzdjd4ejJuWGROdGZjZERtQUVpclNqdFZLcC1nRWhHbWlMbXhFdkhRRDVJN0w3SHVPanM3SnNiRzVSVmJ6dlVPRmg5QVLSAa4BQVVfeXFMT1BhR2FXVFozOUVIM19GaDdDQUVFZmI2R0ZISGxxU2ZFZzRTS1FVUnVUQ1BFUW9lVzhMR3lDaENfTlpjRVhvSmJla01vWXZpdGNRVlJRSzdKTXF4Xzl3OUdVbWJRQXowNGI5UUZCLWlGTGhlTV8yNnJJdlFxNlg2QVFLZ1lMaFZ5TDJUNDM5dFNrRlFzbGR0S3R2RFdqS1B0V2RibzF5LW1fdnBURkFR</guid></item><item><title>4:3 intermittent fasting beats calorie counting for weight loss - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPM1VadFFwa0lkc1U2Ty1fNkd6dTJkM1ZETXAtanc4WjJVei0zRzhIZEhxakVEZHd3VTdIcmdnM3lrYXYtekdwTGdkRU1BdjN4TDZMYnhDZ2lITnR5LUlnaDJUTW1LRUtNS1NfUmllamhrOG1GYzREU0hyRGRoRmxnbktFSDN3WTV6aWJNQkdKSXA1YjFySzFRXzZKa3RwNnZobnQ0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the search for sustainable weight loss, one diet strategy is starting to stand out from the rest. A new yearlong clinical trial has found that a popular form of intermittent fasting—called the 4:3 method—leads to greater weight loss and better health outcomes compared to traditional daily calorie restriction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that this approach may not only be easier to stick with, but also more effective in helping people with excess weight shed pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_study_that_changed_the_conversation"&gt;The Study That Changed the Conversation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was led by researchers at &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and included 165 adults with overweight or obesity.

On the other four days, participants ate normally—but were encouraged to choose healthy foods and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/soft-drinks-baked-goods-may-contribute-to-a-shorter-life-span-study-finds/"&gt;avoid overeating&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, the daily calorie group followed a strict plan that cut daily intake by 34%, requiring participants to count calories and follow a diet that included 55% carbs, 15% protein, and 30% fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of 12 months, participants in the 4:3 group had lost an average of 7.6% of their body weight, compared to a 5% loss in the DCR group.

Participants following the 4:3 plan also showed better results in several key health markers. These included lower systolic &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ai-powered-app-accurately-detects-high-blood-pressure-through-voice-recordings/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, improved fasting glucose levels, and reductions in both total and “bad” LDL cholesterol. These are important risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria Catenacci, MD, one of the study's lead authors and a specialist in obesity medicine, said the findings were both surprising and hopeful. “It was exciting to see that this method led to better outcomes,” she explained. “This is a strategy backed by evidence, especially for people who find daily calorie counting hard to stick with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her co-lead author, Dr. Danielle Ostendorf, agreed. Now a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.utk.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Tennessee Knoxville&lt;/a&gt;, she emphasized the value of this method for real-world use. “The 4:3 approach might be the sweet spot,” she said. “It's flexible enough for people to live their normal lives but strict enough to create a real calorie deficit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_4_3_works_when_others_don_t"&gt;Why 4:3 Works When Others Don’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study stands out because it matched the calorie deficit between both groups—something most similar studies haven't done. Whether participants restricted calories three days a week or every day, they were expected to cut their weekly intake by roughly 34%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr. Danielle Ostendorf, researcher at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

Previous studies using other fasting methods—like the 5:2 plan (fasting two days per week) or alternate-day fasting—didn’t show better weight loss than traditional diets. But this time was different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ostendorf explained why 4:3 might hit the right balance. “Two fast days a week might not be enough to cause big &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/major-study-reveals-how-time-restricted-eating-affects-weight-loss/"&gt;weight changes&lt;/a&gt;,” she said. “But fasting every other day can be too hard. With 4:3, it’s flexible and easier to follow over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers support her view. While 47% of people in the calorie-counting group reached the 5% weight loss target considered clinically meaningful, 58% of the fasting group hit that goal. That’s a big deal when you consider the long-term health benefits tied to just a 5% drop in weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="better_adherence_lower_dropout"&gt;Better Adherence, Lower Dropout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest surprises in the study was that people in the 4:3 fasting group not only ate fewer calories, they also stuck with the program longer. Using a scientific method called the doubly labeled water technique, the researchers tracked actual calorie intake based on how participants’ bodies processed hydrogen and oxygen isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the 4:3 group followed the diet more closely than those in the DCR group, despite having the same target energy deficit. That translated into lower dropout rates: only 19% of the fasting group quit the study by the one-year mark, compared to 30% of the DCR group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Catenacci explained why that may be. “With fasting, you don’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/eating-fewer-ultra-processed-foods-greatly-reduces-type-2-diabetes-risk/"&gt;think about food every day&lt;/a&gt;,” she said. “That may help people feel less overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan also made room for personal flexibility. Participants could pick which three days to fast each week, adjusting around work or social plans. On those days, women aimed for 400–600 calories and men for 500–700, depending on body size. On regular eating days, there were no set limits—but a strong push toward healthy meals and portion control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="behavioral_support_was_key"&gt;Behavioral Support Was Key&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups had access to group-based coaching sessions led by registered dietitians. For the first 12 weeks, they met weekly. After that, the meetings were held every other week. Participants also received a free gym membership and were encouraged to exercise for 300 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/these-four-foods-can-lower-your-risk-of-tinnitus-study-finds/"&gt;behavioral components&lt;/a&gt; played a major role in the study’s success. “The support gave participants accountability and structure,” said Dr. Ostendorf. “That aligns with current clinical guidelines for obesity treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining the 4:3 fasting model with community support, fitness tools, and expert guidance, the research team created an environment that helped participants stick with their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="looking_beyond_the_scale"&gt;Looking Beyond the Scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are not stopping here. They are now studying how 4:3 fasting might benefit specific groups—like breast cancer survivors, older adults, and people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. A pilot program with 15 breast cancer survivors has already been completed, and a new phase is starting soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're also digging deeper into the biology behind the benefits. Stool and blood samples were collected from participants to explore changes in the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gut-microbes-in-infancy-shape-diabetes-risk-and-metabolic-health-for-life/"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and hormones related to hunger and metabolism. These results could help explain why the 4:3 plan works better for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe these fasting periods may offer other metabolic advantages,” said Dr. Ostendorf. “We’re still analyzing those findings, but we suspect that adherence plays a major role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Catenacci added that they’re seeking long-term funding to see how the 4:3 method holds up beyond one year. “Twelve months is great, but we want to know what happens over two or three years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="making_it_accessible"&gt;Making It Accessible&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, there’s no widely available clinic or community program that offers a structured 4:3 intermittent fasting plan. That’s something Dr. Ostendorf hopes to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had people asking how they can try this,” she said. “So now we’re thinking about how to design a low-cost program that could be offered in local clinics or online.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their vision includes making the plan easy to follow, supported by education and tools that empower people to take charge of their own health. If future research continues to support the benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-why-intermittent-fasting-has-anti-aging-effects/"&gt;4:3 intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;, this approach could soon be part of standard care for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPM1VadFFwa0lkc1U2Ty1fNkd6dTJkM1ZETXAtanc4WjJVei0zRzhIZEhxakVEZHd3VTdIcmdnM3lrYXYtekdwTGdkRU1BdjN4TDZMYnhDZ2lITnR5LUlnaDJUTW1LRUtNS1NfUmllamhrOG1GYzREU0hyRGRoRmxnbktFSDN3WTV6aWJNQkdKSXA1YjFySzFRXzZKa3RwNnZobnQ0</guid></item><item><title>Immune Signals Shape Social Behavior and Anxiety in the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE03SlBrYmRDMUxHQVFnVXljYnBGS0JiZnF1WFJKbkVxdk1QcEZpVHNBZ0pEc04ybWpSdTRBMllPSGVOcjh5MU5zczQ2ZEJPaWxGeWJiZTZyOUZoSlgzSlU3ckIxdXEwdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that the immune molecule IL-17 can influence behavior by acting directly on specific regions of the brain. IL-17 reduces neuron excitability in the cortex to enhance sociability, while in the amygdala, it increases excitability and induces anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate that cytokines can act like neuromodulators, linking immune activity to distinct emotional and social behaviors. This growing understanding of neuro-immune interaction could inform treatments for conditions like autism and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Roles of IL-17:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-17 promotes sociability in the cortex and anxiety in the amygdala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromodulator Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-17 acts directly on neurons, influencing excitability and behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting IL-17 pathways may offer new approaches to treat neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune molecules called cytokines play important roles in the body’s defense against infection, helping to control inflammation and coordinating the responses of other immune cells. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that some of these molecules also influence the brain, leading to behavioral changes during illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two new studies from MIT and Harvard Medical School, focused on a cytokine called IL-17, now add to that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108439"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/IL-17-immune-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During infections, this anxiety may be a beneficial response, keeping the sick individual away from others to whom the infection could spread, Choi hypothesizes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that IL-17 acts on two distinct brain regions — the amygdala and the somatosensory cortex — to exert two divergent effects. In the amygdala, IL-17 can elicit feelings of anxiety, while in the cortex it promotes sociable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the immune and nervous systems are tightly interconnected, says Gloria Choi, an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences, a member of MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and one of the senior authors of the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re sick, there’s so many more things that are happening to your internal states, your mood, and your behavioral states, and that’s not simply you being fatigued physically. It has something to do with the brain,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jun Huh, an associate professor of immunology at Harvard Medical School, is also a senior author of both studies, which appear today in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. One of the papers was led by Picower Institute Research Scientist Byeongjun Lee and former Picower Institute research scientist Jeong-Tae Kwon, and the other was led by Harvard Medical School postdoc Yunjin Lee and Picower Institute postdoc Tomoe Ishikawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi and Huh became interested in IL-17 several years ago, when they found it was involved in a phenomenon known as the fever effect. Large-scale studies of autistic children have found that for many of them, their behavioral symptoms temporarily diminish when they have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2019 study in mice, Choi and Huh showed that in some cases of infection, IL-17 is released and suppresses a small region of the brain’s cortex known as S1DZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overactivation of neurons in this region can lead to autism-like behavioral symptoms in mice, including repetitive behaviors and reduced sociability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This molecule became a link that connects immune system activation, manifested as a fever, to changes in brain function and changes in the animals’ behavior,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IL-17 comes in six different forms, and there are five different receptors that can bind to it. In their two new papers, the researchers set out to map which of these receptors are expressed in different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mapping revealed that a pair of receptors known as IL-17RA and IL-17RB is found in the cortex, including in the S1DZ region that the researchers had previously identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The receptors are located in a population of neurons that receive proprioceptive input and are involved in controlling behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a type of IL-17 known as IL-17E binds to these receptors, the neurons become less excitable, which leads to the behavioral effects seen in the 2019 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“IL-17E, which we’ve shown to be necessary for behavioral mitigation, actually does act almost exactly like a neuromodulator in that it will immediately reduce these neurons’ excitability,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, there is an immune molecule that’s acting as a neuromodulator in the brain, and its main function is to regulate excitability of neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi hypothesizes that IL-17 may have originally evolved as a neuromodulator, and later on was appropriated by the immune system to play a role in promoting inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That idea is consistent with previous work showing that in the worm &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, IL-17 has no role in the immune system but instead acts on neurons. Among its effects in worms, IL-17 promotes aggregation, a form of social behavior. Additionally, in mammals, IL-17E is actually made by neurons in the cortex, including S1DZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a possibility that a couple of forms of IL-17 perhaps evolved first and foremost to act as a neuromodulator in the brain, and maybe later were hijacked by the immune system also to act as immune modulators,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provoking anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the other &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper, the researchers explored another brain location where they found IL-17 receptors — the amygdala. This almond-shaped structure plays an important role in processing emotions, including fear and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study revealed that in a region known as the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the IL-17RA and IL-17RE receptors, which work as a pair, are expressed in a discrete population of neurons. When these receptors bind to IL-17A and IL-17C, the neurons become more excitable, leading to an increase in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that, counterintuitively, if animals are treated with antibodies that block IL-17 receptors, it actually increases the amount of IL-17C circulating in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding may help to explain unexpected outcomes observed in a clinical trial of a drug targeting the IL-17-RA receptor for psoriasis treatment, particularly regarding its potential adverse effects on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that there’s a possibility that the IL-17 ligand that is upregulated in this patient cohort might act on the brain to induce suicide ideation, while in animals there is an anxiogenic phenotype,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During infections, this anxiety may be a beneficial response, keeping the sick individual away from others to whom the infection could spread, Choi hypothesizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other than its main function of fighting pathogens, one of the ways that the immune system works is to control the host behavior, to protect the host itself and also protect the community the host belongs to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the ways the immune system is doing that is to use cytokines, secreted factors, to go to the brain as communication tools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the same BLA neurons that have receptors for IL-17 also have receptors for IL-10, a cytokine that suppresses inflammation. This molecule counteracts the excitability generated by IL-17, giving the body a way to shut off anxiety once it’s no longer useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinctive behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the two studies suggest that the immune system, and even a single family of cytokines, can exert a variety of effects in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have now different combinations of IL-17 receptors being expressed in different populations of neurons, in two different brain regions, that regulate very distinct behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One is actually somewhat positive and enhances social behaviors, and another is somewhat negative and induces anxiogenic phenotypes,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her lab is now working on additional mapping of IL-17 receptor locations, as well as the IL-17 molecules that bind to them, focusing on the S1DZ region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a better understanding of these neuro-immune interactions may help researchers develop new treatments for neurological conditions such as autism or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that these molecules are made by the immune system gives us a novel approach to influence brain function as means of therapeutics,” Choi says. “Instead of thinking about directly going for the brain, can we think about doing something to the immune system?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by Jeongho Kim and the Brain Impact Foundation Neuro-Immune Fund, the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, the Simons Center for the Social Brain, the Marcus Foundation, the N of One: Autism Research Foundation, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Picower Institute Innovation Fund, the MIT John W.

This suggests that passive states of mind, similar to sleep-like neural activity, can support certain types of unconscious learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Learning Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Mind wandering didn’t harm performance and sometimes improved learning in low-attention tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Activity Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep-like cortical oscillations were associated with better task performance during mind wandering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spontaneity Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Spontaneous mind wandering was more beneficial than deliberate daydreaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people let their minds wander during tasks that require attention and active thinking, it can hurt how well they learn and perform the tasks.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 study participants performed a simple learning task while the researchers recorded their brain activity. This simple task was used because participants could make predictions based off probabilities that they learned without awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering while doing the task did not worsen performance, and in some cases even enhanced learning. Spontaneous mind wandering was more beneficial to learning than deliberate mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During mind wandering and improvements in task learning, oscillatory neural activity in the cortex, resembling the brain activity that occurs during sleep or sleep-like states, occurred. Thus, sleep-like neural activity linked to spontaneous mind wandering promotes learning in tasks that require minimal attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cognitive work looks at learning when you are fully engaged. But in real life we spend so much time passively learning! As our brain needs sleep, maybe we also need passive ways of learning, or ‘wakeful rest,’ to recover from tasks that require your brain to be online and engaged,” says Simor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this learning and daydreaming research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f121a1b161e3f0c191151100d18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1421-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mind Wandering During Implicit Learning is Associated with Increased Periodic EEG Activity and Improved Extraction of Hidden Probabilistic Patterns&lt;/a&gt;” by Péter Simor et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Wandering During Implicit Learning is Associated with Increased Periodic EEG Activity and Improved Extraction of Hidden Probabilistic Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering, occupying 30-50% of our waking time, remains an enigmatic phenomenon in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large number of studies showed a negative association between mind wandering and attention-demanding (model-based) tasks in both natural settings and laboratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering, however, does not seem to be detrimental for all cognitive domains, and was observed to benefit creativity and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined if mind wandering may facilitate model-free processes, such as probabilistic learning, which relies on the automatic acquisition of statistical regularities with minimal attentional demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We administered a well-established implicit probabilistic learning task combined with thought probes in healthy adults (N = 37, 30 females).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the neural correlates of mind wandering and probabilistic learning, participants were fitted with high-density electroencephalography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that probabilistic learning was not only immune to periods of mind wandering but was positively associated with it.

However, its role in the relationship between the early environment and later cognition is unclear, in part due to focus on changes in specific gray matter regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines white matter differences across adolescents from diverse environments, evaluating both their extent throughout the brain and their contribution to cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (N = 9,082, female = 4,327), we found extensive cross-sectional associations with lower white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and streamline count in the brains of 9- and 10-y-old children exposed to a range of experiences, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, and neighborhood adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower values of FA were associated with later difficulties with mental arithmetic and receptive language. Furthermore, white matter FA partially mediated the detrimental relationship between adversity and cognition later in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings advance a white matter-based account of the neural and cognitive effects of adversity, which supports leading developmental theories that place interregional connectivity prior to gray matter maturation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:20:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9JeElxc2xob3otZC1MQ2duTVhlWF83NFdVM2d4c3NycmVuZ29RUEU3M2YwY2NzV1FnY0pMZnJFMkZHWWxrdm9GSWQtRDQyRXRubWNrNEJGMHowU1g0VUQ5ejZGeGdnRXEzZHlWYXJncWRxM1Zaa3l4ZmpaQVRoOUk</guid></item><item><title>Common sweetener can destroy some of the most dangerous bacteria - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdkxMY055dDZCT2x0SE9hZXhrWVJFbXdxcVFXQ3dFaHV2NVQ0RDEzZkhxUGNYU1UxLVZLTmFub01QUklzRHZlNE5McC1fZkVkVDRwOTlRZ0FvT0ptckdvNXIxbUdVZjBDMnBoN2xMaU1wS1hJSjV1RjB4ZUt6NmkwbHlQd01mRTZ3NWs0ZlQ3V21xR1ZsZTJF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin, a common artificial sweetener, may soon play a new medical role. Recent research shows it can destroy some of the world’s most dangerous bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistance is one of the major threats to modern medicine,” said Professor Ronan McCarthy, who led the study at &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brunel University London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Procedures such as tooth extractions and cancer treatment often rely on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nanoplastics-can-alter-the-course-of-antibiotics-within-our-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to prevent or treat infection. But doctors are increasingly facing cases where the drugs no longer work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deadly-pathogens-are-becoming-resistant"&gt;Deadly pathogens are becoming resistant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused 1.27 million deaths in 2019. Nearly five million deaths involved resistant infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous bacteria include &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, both of which thrive in hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization lists them among its highest-priority threats. These bacteria often infect those with weakened immune systems and resist most antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-sweetener-destroys-bacteria"&gt;How the sweetener destroys bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In exciting work led by our team, we’ve identified a novel antimicrobial – saccharin,” Professor McCarthy said. “Saccharin breaks the walls of bacterial pathogens, causing them to distort and eventually burst, killing the bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This physical breakdown lets antibiotics enter the bacteria more easily. As a result, saccharin helps conventional drugs work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin has been used in food for over a century. It is considered safe for human consumption. Until now, though, little was known about the sweetener’s direct impact on bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-chaos-inside-bacterial-cells"&gt;DNA chaos: Inside bacterial cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals saccharin disrupts more than bacterial walls. It also messes with DNA inside bacterial cells. Treated bacteria grow long and thin, unable to divide. Their DNA starts replicating out of control, especially away from the usual origin points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, DNA replication in bacteria starts at a site called the ori and ends at the ter. After saccharin treatment, the researchers observed far more ori and ter points than expected. This suggests multiple rounds of replication continue unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This DNA chaos may stem from saccharin triggering DNA repair processes. These repair systems start replication from damaged spots instead of the usual starting site. As a result, DNA builds up rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-weakens-bacteria-s-defense"&gt;Sweetener weakens bacteria’s defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin also changes how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/frogs-lead-the-way-in-developing-new-antibiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; maintain their outer layers. The sweetener disrupts proteins and pathways involved in making and protecting the cell envelope. This weakens the bacteria’s defense, making them easier to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that saccharin caused bacteria to form strange bulges. These bulges eventually burst, killing the cell. This effect mimics what happens when bacteria are exposed to powerful β-lactam antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biofilms-and-resistant-strains"&gt;Biofilms and resistant strains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria often form biofilms – sticky layers that protect them from antibiotics. Saccharin prevents bacteria from forming these biofilms and can also break down ones that already exist. It even worked on polymicrobial biofilms, which are tougher to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin increased how well antibiotics entered resistant &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cigarette-waste-fuels-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt;. When researchers combined saccharin with carbapenem antibiotics, the treatment became far more effective. Drug-resistant bacteria showed reduced resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-saccharin-can-treat-wounds"&gt;Saccharin can treat wounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test real-world use, scientists embedded saccharin into hydrogels. These hydrogels were applied to burn wounds in a lab model using pig skin. The saccharin-infused gel outperformed silver-based wound dressings, cutting down bacterial infections significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Artificial sweeteners are found in many diet and sugar-free foods. We discovered that the same sweeteners you have with your coffee or in a ‘sugar-free’ drink could make some of the world’s most dangerous &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-antibiotic-found-in-soil-has-potential-to-fight-superbugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; easier to treat,” said Professor McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fight-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;The fight against antibiotic resistance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world may soon face a future where antibiotics no longer cure infections. This is because bacteria are changing and becoming stronger due to the heavy use of antibiotics in both medicine and farming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When antibiotics are used too often, bacteria learn how to fight back, making treatments less effective. At the same time, scientists aren’t discovering many new antibiotics to replace the ones that are failing. This means common infections could become serious or even deadly again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without new solutions, the growing problem of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-could-cause-a-health-crisis-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; resistance puts millions of lives at risk and makes routine treatments more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has created a dangerous situation,” said Professor McCarthy. “We urgently need new drugs to treat resistant infections – and saccharin could represent a new therapeutic approach with exciting promise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00219-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:09:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdkxMY055dDZCT2x0SE9hZXhrWVJFbXdxcVFXQ3dFaHV2NVQ0RDEzZkhxUGNYU1UxLVZLTmFub01QUklzRHZlNE5McC1fZkVkVDRwOTlRZ0FvT0ptckdvNXIxbUdVZjBDMnBoN2xMaU1wS1hJSjV1RjB4ZUt6NmkwbHlQd01mRTZ3NWs0ZlQ3V21xR1ZsZTJF</guid></item><item><title>Childhood experiences shape the brain's white matter with cognitive effects seen years later, study shows - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQaDZPQzVqWjFRYm1uNEQwcW5kNUQ4OVY4MTNLNVM0OXNZLTFVX1VTd0VIdThFY2JnQWFUSkdTUnNrUk9PTy1JM202MjlydVJiWVdGV2pHZlFPMTNiZmF6ejZOU0xJMEJyQTZVbWpKWk9KZ0ZsR0tiUS1ScVRJRUJ2THM3Y21qcFdlWElN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass General Brigham investigators have linked difficult early life experiences with reduced quality and quantity of the white matter communication highways throughout the adolescent brain. This reduced connectivity is also associated with lower performance on cognitive tasks. However, certain social resiliency factors like neighborhood cohesion and positive parenting may have a protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Results are published in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409985122" target="_blank"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White matter are the communication highways that allow the brain networks to carry out the necessary functions for cognition and behavior. They develop over the course of childhood, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/childhood+experiences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;childhood experiences&lt;/a&gt; may drive &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/individual+differences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;individual differences&lt;/a&gt; in how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/white+matter/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Sofia Carozza, Ph.D., and senior author Amar Dhand, MD, Ph.D., of the Department of Neurology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, wanted to understand what role this process plays in cognition once children reach adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The aspects of white matter that show a relationship with our early life environment are much more pervasive throughout the brain than we'd thought. Instead of being just one or two tracts that are important for cognition, the whole brain is related to the adversities that someone might experience early in life," said Carozza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team studied data from 9,082 children (about half of them girls, with an average age of 9.5) collected in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. This study, conducted at 21 centers across the U.S., gathered information on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; and structure, cognitive abilities, environment, mood and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at several categories of early environmental factors, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, neighborhood adversity, and social resiliency factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carozza and Dhand used diffusion imaging scanning of the brain to measure &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fractional+anisotropy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fractional anisotropy&lt;/a&gt; (FA)—a way of estimating the integrity of the white matter connections—and streamline count, an estimate of their strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then used a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computational+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computational model&lt;/a&gt; to compare how these features of white matter were related to both childhood environmental factors and current &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+abilities/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive abilities&lt;/a&gt; such as language skills and mental arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed widespread differences in white matter connections throughout the brain depending on the children's early-life environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the researchers found lower quality of white matter connections in parts of the brain tied to mental arithmetic and receptive language. These white matter differences accounted for some of the relationship between adverse life experiences in early childhood and lower cognitive performance in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are all embedded in an environment, and features of that environment such as our relationships, home life, neighborhood, or material circumstances can shape how our brains and bodies grow, which in turn affects what we can do with them," said Carozza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We should work to make sure that more people can have those stable, healthy home lives that the brain expects, especially in childhood."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their study is based on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/observational+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;observational data&lt;/a&gt;, which means they cannot draw strong causal conclusions. Brain imaging was also only available at a single timepoint, offering a snapshot but not allowing researchers to track changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospective studies—following children over time and collecting brain imaging information at multiple time points—would be needed to more definitively connect adversity and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Edwards treated the siblings of the first child who died of measles. The family sought care from Edwards for their other four children, who were also unvaccinated and fell ill from measles after their 6-year-old sibling died. Edward's involvement was revealed in an interview with the deceased child's parents, which was led by the rabid anti-vaccine organization Kennedy founded and until recently headed, Children's Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/anti-vaccine-group-founded-by-rfk-jr-weaponizes-childs-measles-death/"&gt;In the interview&lt;/a&gt;, the CHD representatives, like Malone, led the parents to believe that the child's death was not from measles and that vaccines are harmful. The mother of the child concluded in the interview to deter other parents from immunizing their children against measles, despite the death of her daughter: "Don't do the shots. There [are] doctors that can help with measles. [Measles is] not as bad as they're making it out to be," she said, through a translator of low German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message from Kennedy and these alternative practitioners has clearly impacted the communities in West Texas. Some unvaccinated children hospitalized with measles have signs of vitamin A toxicity, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/07/vitamin-a-poisoning-measles-rfk-jr/"&gt;doctors told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three deaths amid an outbreak with under 600 reported measles cases are also raising questions. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. Three reported deaths so far in the outbreak could be a statistical blip. But health experts are questioning whether the outbreak is much larger than known—if parents are not bringing their sick children to health providers—and/or if parents are delaying care, relying on unproven treatments, which could up the risk of life-threatening cases. The CDC also estimates that about 20 percent of US children with measles are hospitalized. With 58 hospitalizations reported so far, the percentage is about half of what's expected.&lt;/p&gt;

Among them was hair loss, which can occur as a result of nutrient or protein deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a5d9ac40-13c0-11f0-93dc-d7dabae5537a" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, began taking a common over-the-counter vitamin that claimed to improve hair, skin and nail health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soon after beginning the vitamins in late February, she began noticing yellowing of her eyes and skin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctors discovered she was experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protect against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, but no cases of this have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Ramirez has become jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She has also undergone surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, block the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gallbladder stores and releases the digestive fluid produced by the liver. But doctors may have to remove it if hard deposits form there, blocking the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez did not say how her doctor concluded that MSM was the culprit, though supplements, which are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6269695/Hundreds-natural-supplements-contain-active-drugs-FDA-knows-doesnt-tell-public.html"&gt;not regulated by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, can be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13663359/fda-recalls-herbal-supplement-sold-amazon-life-threatening-risk.html"&gt;contaminated along&lt;/a&gt; the production line or come in dosages that are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14470339/Doctor-reveals-popular-supplements-health-crises.html"&gt;far higher than recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, Texas is experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her hair growth supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez warned her TikTok followers of the risk of taking the supplement, which was made and sold by a [popular drugstore, from her hospital bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, apart from needing my gallbladder removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They thought I had hepatitis, and [the tests] were all negative, negative, negative, negative. They’re like, have you started any new medicine, I’m like, no. [They asked] Have you started a new multivitamin or any vitamins?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that as she has shed pounds, she has taken more supplements to stay strong and replenish any vitamin deficiencies from changing her diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among them was a supplement designed to strengthen the protein in hair and nails, boost collagen, and increase levels of minerals like zinc and vitamin E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘It didn’t click to me to be like, oh, I started a hair, nails [vitamin]. So today, my GI doctor came in. He’s like have you started a hair growth vitamin? And I’m like, yeah.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor told her that she ‘induced liver failure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Be very careful doing these vitamins, these supplements,’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez had to have her gallbladder removed as a result of severe damage to her liver, which processes digestive fluids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors first believed she may have hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver. Many diagnostic tests showed nothing abnormal. But her gastroenterologist floated the idea that MSM could be the culprit behind her jaundiced skin and eyes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her case is seemingly rare as there are no similar instances &lt;span&gt;recorded in humans or mice in the medical literature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jenny-heal-and-care-for-her-family?attribution_id=sl:f0dbae17-7c9a-4b7b-9368-161a4428eee2&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_t1-amp14_t2&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;: 'I would never think I would be in this spot in a million years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez said she had taken the CVS brand supplement.

Among them was hair loss, which can occur as a result of nutrient or protein deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a5d9ac40-13c0-11f0-93dc-d7dabae5537a" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, began taking a common over-the-counter vitamin that claimed to improve hair, skin and nail health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soon after beginning the vitamins in late February, she began noticing yellowing of her eyes and skin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctors discovered she was experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protect against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, but no cases of this have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Ramirez has become jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She has also undergone surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, blocking the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, Texas is experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her hair growth supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gallbladder stores and releases the digestive fluid produced by the liver. But doctors may have to remove it if hard deposits form there, blocking the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez did not say how her doctor concluded that MSM was the culprit, though supplements, which are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6269695/Hundreds-natural-supplements-contain-active-drugs-FDA-knows-doesnt-tell-public.html"&gt;not regulated by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, can be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13663359/fda-recalls-herbal-supplement-sold-amazon-life-threatening-risk.html"&gt;contaminated along&lt;/a&gt; the production line or come in dosages that are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14470339/Doctor-reveals-popular-supplements-health-crises.html"&gt;far higher than recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom-of-four warned her TikTok followers of the risk of taking the supplement, which was made and sold by a [popular drugstore, from her hospital bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, apart from needing my gallbladder removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They thought I had hepatitis, and [the tests] were all negative, negative, negative, negative. They’re like, have you started any new medicine, I’m like, no.

So today, my GI doctor came in. He’s like have you started a hair growth vitamin? And I’m like, yeah.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor told her that she ‘induced liver failure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Be very careful doing these vitamins, these supplements,’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez had to have her gallbladder removed as a result of severe damage to her liver, which processes digestive fluids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors first believed she may have hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver.

                                        Estimated read time: 6-7
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not insulin's fault. Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package. The package allows two people to get body scans. These scans identify potential underlying conditions that cause insulin resistance and stubborn weight. You will walk away with a 17-page report detailing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts will review the results of the scan with you, correlate its findings with your health history. This provides a tremendous amount of information allowing him to make valuable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also be able to fill out a proprietary survey that will give you insight into health issues that likely compromise your weight loss efforts.

found 60 percent of people reported an improvement of their migraine attack after participating in some of form of sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Having an orgasm may help you get rid of that days-long migraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologists sent a questionnaire to 306 migraine patients and 96 cluster headache patients who had been treated over a two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to answer eight questions, including whether they had any experience with sexual activity during a headache attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A deep analysis into their answers showed out of the 34 percent of people who had experience with sexual activity during a migraine attack, 60 percent saw their attacks improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this, 43 percent of people with migraines found their headache changed shortly after orgasm or maximal excitement, about 18 percent reported the change with the time of orgasm, 20 percent found the change at the beginning of sexual activity while another 20 percent had the change within 30 minutes of orgasm or maximal excitement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of cluster headaches, out of the 31 percent of the patients that had experience with sexual activity during an attack, 37 percent reported an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While researchers are yet to discover the exact cause of migraines, some believe that specific nerves in the blood vessels can send pain signals to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This releases inflammatory substances into the head's nerves and blood vessels - causing a strong throbbing or pulsing pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress, anxiety and emotional triggers can also release chemicals in the brain that contribute to migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Megan Donnelly, a neurologist and headache specialist with Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina who was not involved in the study, orgasms and pain affect the same areas of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that orgasms stimulate the production of endorphins, which are natural pain relievers in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The release of endorphins from sex can be a powerful distraction as well as give relief from the pain of a migraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a migraine attack, people may have lower levels of certain neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. Both of these neurotransmitters are released during sexual activity and can improve the ache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The release of endorphins from sex can be a powerful distraction as well as give relief from the pain of a migraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study also found 33 percent of people who suffered from migraines and 50 percent of people with cluster headaches saw their condition worsen after sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Donnelly noted: 'Although 60 percent of migraine patients surveyed reported an improvement in their headaches with sexual activity, one-third of those with migraines found their headaches worsened with sex.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study published in the Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology found 78 percent of people living with migraines - mostly women - also experienced sexual dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the longer the duration of migraines and the more frequent they were, the lower the sexual functioning among migraine sufferers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologist told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdlinx.com/article/migraines-exploring-sex-as-a-cure-and-cause/7uCku8mRtkVKoyyxPs8hrV"&gt;MDLink&lt;/a&gt;: 'Treating migraines may positively impact sexual dysfunction, but individual responses can vary.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the expert, some migraine sufferers may also be experiencing a condition called sex headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Megan Donnelly, a woman's neurologist and headache specialist with Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Headaches associated with sexual activity, sometimes called 'orgasm headaches' or 'sex headaches,' can range from mild to severe and occur during or after sexual activity, often around the time of orgasm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324719#:~:text=When%20a%20person%20has%20an,intense%20headaches%20in%20some%20people."&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, orgasms can rapidly increase blood pressure which can cause blood vessels in the head to dilate.  This can trigger sudden, intense headaches in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, they are considered benign and do not have an underlying cause, however, at times sex headaches can be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as problems with blood vessels in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These kind of headaches occurs four times more often in men and people are usually in their 40s when it first happens, according to a 2010 study published in The Journal of Headache and Pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 17:02:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOYkVTSC0xcllZX2lfUzVwcFJFRjBpb2NmV2twLWx3R3ZHaEJKYVNXYmxPbHdHX0YwUjYxOHJNMnFfR1NkQnY3OUx0cWx0OS1VWE9Wc242M0dvUVczdThqTHg1QUpZOExQSUJQRTBnZkVxNEpVd2NrZUQ1RzdvdnFEaGUtdFJVYmhpS2E4NzhmTzZwV2Q1WUx1STNuRFZIemo0SlFTWNIBqgFBVV95cUxOSG43S2ZGVTkyQzN5OFhWMml0OURDeFZETms5UWFORGt3RHpQOWx3RUhJaXFqNE5jVWMxbkxZeUtsQVcxZ0VqUlFzRl9JMi1HbDRrakpLdE8yX2prdWpWODRoaVVxdXdyX2tsWDNmVlZRcDZsXzBreGtUaGlfLXFLcC1JZENTcVRXelE5NUt1YXNrUkR6cUhDaFZYcWU3OG0wX1BXSEJRUUJJdw</guid></item><item><title>What exactly is brain fog?

Recently, however, scientists have made some breakthroughs in understanding what might provoke it in some conditions—particularly long COVID—and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;What brain fog is—and what it isn’t &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While there is no universally agreed upon definition of brain fog—and many experts debate how useful the term is in a clinical setting—most scientists consider it to be a set of symptoms of an underlying condition rather than a diagnosis. “Brain fog has become a catch all for all of the broader neurological symptoms of certain conditions like long COVID,” Becker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As to why so many different conditions cause similar symptoms, it might be because brain fog can point to deficits in many areas of cognition, including attention, concentration, or ability to execute tasks, says Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “If the brain isn’t functioning properly, people call it brain fog.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Yet experts distinguish brain fog from cognitive impairment, the latter of which results in deficits in memory or attention that can be &lt;i class=" "&gt;measured&lt;/i&gt;. Patients with brain fog often report problems with attention and memory, but clinicians can’t always find measurable deficits in these areas. Sometimes, patients with brain fog undergo a battery of tests, only for everything to come back normal, she says. “That can be really frustrating for patients,” Becker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Physicians sometimes dismiss the brain fog as purely psychological in nature. This is particularly true for people with chronic conditions or long COVID, who often feel like their providers aren’t taking them seriously, Becker says.“There is a prevailing perspective that long COVID,” has a purely psychiatric origin, she says. “And I think it's important to challenge that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 17:01:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9UTlZtdS02aHoxa2tMR2ZJaExCWUtlcnNzQjZ5Uk13cEtqVVZRYTZVUUk4cU5TQlZUYVNYcEV4ZlB3VW55anZMQlhZaWRIZ1lQN3lua1RFdXNXZ3UyZzhxWmJRVWdxU0ZMaVFCWTdfOHg4bE9yQ0ZtUHc2VkJFR2c</guid></item><item><title>Man receives world's first sperm transplant in groundbreaking experiment to reverse infertility - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man in his early 20s has received the world's first sperm-making stem cell transplant in a new procedure that could be groundbreaking for infertility treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, the procedure had only been tested in animals. But it successfully allowed male mice and monkeys to father offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient was diagnosed with azoospermia, a condition that causes no sperm to be present in his ejaculate and makes it impossible to naturally conceive a child, after receiving chemotherapy as a child to treat bone &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-da70d850-13cc-11f0-a4f1-4f5cc1f4a174" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But men can develop azoospermia for a number of reasons, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13988987/frightening-effect-consuming-soup-body.html"&gt;hormonal dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a blockage along the reproductive tract and certain genetic conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, azoospermia affects roughly 645,000 men between the ages of 20 to 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this clinical trial, doctors implanted the man's own stem cells — which were harvested and frozen during his childhood before he underwent chemotherapy  — into his reproductive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14531869/paralyzed-man-walks-stem-cell-injection-treatment.html"&gt;Stem cells are capable of developing into many different types of cells in the body&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the doctors used sperm-forming stem cells, which are present in the testicles at birth and later mature into sperm cells during puberty. If the transplant succeeds, the patient should begin producing sperm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man in his early 20s has received the world's first sperm-making stem cell transplant, and this new procedure could be groundbreaking for infertility treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No sperm cells have been detected in his semen yet, but ultrasounds confirmed his hormone levels and the procedure did not damage the man's testicular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Going forward, the doctors will analyze a sample of his semen twice a year to see if it contains sperm cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If refined and proven safe, spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation could be a revolutionary fertility-restoring technique for men who've lost the ability to produce sperm,' Dr Justin Houman, an assistant professor of urology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who was not involved in the study, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/man-gets-sperm-making-stem-cell-transplant-in-first-of-its-kind-procedure"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This treatment may prove especially beneficial for other cancer patients who received chemotherapy before puberty, and thus developed azoospermia, or men with 'genetic or acquired testicular failure,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The historic procedure is detailed in a paper published on the preprint server &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.25.25324518v1"&gt;medRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, which features research that is still undergoing review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young men at risk of developing azoospermia can choose to harvest and preserve their sperm-forming stem cells for future use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they are diagnosed with the condition after reaching sexual maturity, doctors can then return these stem cells to where they came from: the rete testis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rete testis are small tubes helps move sperm cells from the testicles to the epididymis: a narrow, tightly-coiled tube that is attached to each of the testicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This treatment may prove especially beneficial other cancer patients who received chemotherapy before therapy, and thus developed azoospermia, or men with genetic or acquired testicular failure (STOCK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is done using an ultrasound-guided needle. In theory, once the stem cells are implanted, they can mature and begin producing sperm — essentially giving the patient a second chance at puberty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers noted that there is a chance that the patient who participated in this clinical trial may never recover his fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said one reason for this could be that only a small amount of stem cells were harvested from the patient during his childhood to avoid damaging his reproductive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, it's possible that any sperm production resulting from the transplant may be limited, if it occurs at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the patient never begins producing a sufficient amount of sperm cells, he will still have other options for fathering a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through surgery, doctors could try to recover any sperm cells he does produce and use them for in vitro fertilization (IVF), which involves growing an embryo in a lab with sperm and stem cells that have been harvested from each parent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are other risks too, especially for patients with azoospermia who have also been diagnosed with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For these patients, some of the transplanted stem cells could have cancer-causing genetic mutations that could eventually develop into new tumors, Houman told LiveScience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What's more, there's also a 'theoretical risk' that the transplant could trigger a dangerous inflammatory response from the patient, even though it uses their own cells, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to proceed cautiously, and with rigorous oversight,' he said. 'This is promising science — but it's still early days.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Then there are seven supplements you need to add to your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health coach Cory Rodriguez has revealed how to improve all four of these areas of your life by taking a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14556439/bryan-johnson-pill-aging-longevity.html"&gt;cocktail of daily supplements containing magnesium. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that comes in many forms, each with their own benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first form of magnesium Mr Rodriguez recommends is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14555957/The-cheap-powder-gym-fanatics-love-ease-depression-tiredness-chronic-fatigue-long-Covid-Oxford-researchers-say-semi-essential.html"&gt;magnesium glycinate for  sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Sleep Foundation notes this&lt;span&gt; form of magnesium can be easily absorbed by the body and it is recommended by sleep experts to 'promote calm, relaxation, and improved sleep'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Naoki Umeda from the Cleveland Clinic recommends keeping your magnesium dosage for sleep at 200mg nightly and taking the supplement about 30 minutes before bedtime. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next up, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium chloride is the best version for digestion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this supplement can positively impact digestion by acting as a natural laxative, easing constipation, and potentially reducing bloating and cramping due to its muscle-relaxing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health coach Cory Rodriguez has revealed how to improve your sleep, digestion, memory and energy by taking a cocktail of daily supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Annie Price, who is a certified holistic health coach for health company DrAxe.com, explains that magnesium chloride aids digestion by offsetting a decline of gastric acid secretion in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gastric acid is produced by the stomach, and she highlights that it's 'absolutely essential to proper digestion because it helps break down foods into smaller absorbable units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without enough gastric acid, we not only can have suboptimal digestion, but we can also experience a malabsorption of essential nutrients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, an excessive intake of magnesium chloride can lead to digestive issues like diarrhea. The recommended dose is 500mg to 1,000mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For an extra boost of energy, Mr Rodriguez - who has close to 3million followers on Instagram - advises stocking up on magnesium malate. The dose ranges from 200mg to 400mg per day, depending on your gender, age and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritional compound, which is a blend of magnesium and malic acid, is touted for promoting energy production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietician Ozgenaz Kazan explains: 'Malic acid, a component of magnesium malate, is a key player in cellular energy production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It takes center stage in the process known as the Krebs cycle, which is a central part of how our bodies generate energy from the foods we eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This energy production can lead to increased vitality and decreased feelings of fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if you've been looking for a natural way to boost your energy levels, magnesium malate might be worth considering.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're looking to improve your focus and ability to concentrate, Mr Rodriguez recommends magnesium L-threonate as an option. The recommended dosage of this supplement is 2000mg per day, with four 500mg tablets &lt;span&gt;split between mornings and evenings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one human study, the supplement was shown to improve learning, recall, memory and cognitive abilities, with older people demonstrating the most improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving to another area of the body, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium sulfate - commonly known as Epsom salts - can help ease sore muscles and aid relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The salts are a popular addition to warm baths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Detailing the benefits, Dr Umeda explains: 'The idea is that when you pour Epsom salt into warm water, it dissolves the magnesium and sulfate and allows it to be absorbed into your body through your skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Rodriguez says that magnesium chloride is the best thing for digestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Centuries of user testimonials claim wonderful benefits from using Epsom salt this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Scientific research, however, isn't quite as vocal in its support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are no definitive studies showing that magnesium can be absorbed through your skin in sufficient amounts to address potential deficiencies of the mineral. And what research has been done offers skepticism.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says when purchasing Epsom salt, it is important to buy a product that's 100 percent magnesium sulfate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then he suggests pouring about 300g of Epsom salt into a tub as it fills with hot water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'Once the bath is drawn, test the water for its heat level and adjust as needed. You don't want to scald yourself. Slowly ease yourself into the tub and relax. A 15-minute soak should be enough.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another muscle Mr Rodriguez says magnesium can benefit is the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium taurate is a dietary supplement made up of magnesium and taurine, an amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many health brands recommend taking three 500mg capsules per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why these ingredients can benefit the heart, experts from Health.com note: 'In addition to reducing blood pressure, magnesium taurate may have an overall cardioprotective effect - meaning that it may protect heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could be due to its antioxidant properties, or its ability to reduce cell damage caused by oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Magnesium supplements, including magnesium taurate, have been found to prevent and treat high cholesterol, cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), stroke, and heart disease. They may also help to reduce the overall damage after experiencing a myocardial infarction (heart attack).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium citrate is a great remedy for constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have reported positive outcomes using doses ranging from 290mg to 2,000mg per day, depending on individual factors and the severity of constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, most experts recommend starting with a smaller dose, such as 200mg to 400mg per day, and then gradually upping the dosage as required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians from the Cleveland Clinic explain that it works by increasing the amount of water your intestine absorbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This softens the stool, making it easier to have a bowel movement, while at the same time, it increases pressure, which prompts the muscles in your intestines to move the stool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, the recommended maximum daily intake of magnesium supplements for adults is 350 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts note that excessive intake can potentially lead to side effects like diarrhea, nausea, and cramping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rodriguez says he generally sticks to magnesium glycinate as i&lt;span&gt;t's 'quite useful for better sleep and this type is also very absorbable by the body, so it does a good job of raising magnesium levels in the blood'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:29:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxObHNQT1EwRlRhZFpfS3JCLWFqb3hxczRZMGpwVlN0Qm4xOXJ2R2RYMUVRZm0xc3FEcjlwMDJveFNPZE1jYVZXa3doV2J3WVN2MnByblh0enYxNDlLR3QyMENNVFFnZUxCV1lQcnI2MXI5ZVB6RFpucjEwZ2lya21sSXBTWG9Da2FFTVVhRktidy0xV0tMbXMwUWlaeWJzemVZVDA1dlRQVFRwZ9IBrwFBVV95cUxPNlE5dGl4QVljUnRqZnFYVzdXakdnQndPZGVIc1JhWkpkSWU1dFR6b1FYQnFzS0hma25mYmxQQUUyWXRZekZ0NE85YWVPbEh4NUpOdmxSemt1OFVMOEZxUWdMdGd1czRvZGtnUFJ0Y3hUeFlDc2hMX3FwRDJ4a0xIaTY3eFVacUw0Yk9qa3hIU0tCQWRjQUxyY1ZUNXhEVV9YVGQ1Z3NKV0haZTl0MVRR</guid></item><item><title>Robert F Kennedy Jr claims anti-vax physicians healed ‘some 300 measles-stricken children’ - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNc0RTOU5taHNzcTBCYmZGVDlReW9qa09fdWJuc2FqZ0xHTmFzd2hTcFJmTjUwOGM5S3E2aTY5Z1ljU3M0TGtkSnlLYjlXMnlSMjFoTWlVUy1lSW5oWlhoeDlxdnMyOUs3U2lzcGNzVDZkVHdYMUJfdWk1aHRqQjhkRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;

At the time, he had stopped short of endorsing the MMR vaccine, which he minimized as merely a “personal choice” rather than a public health and safety measure that long ago was proven effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday following his presence in Seminole at the funeral of Daisy Hildebrand, an unvaccinated eight-year-old who died on 3 April, Kennedy said he had visited with Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards – and claimed without evidence the anti-vax physicians had treated and healed “some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Texas Medical Board &lt;a href="https://www.tmb.state.tx.us/dl/FB642150-D8B3-A8F6-F5D3-E5832892E381" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disciplined&lt;/a&gt; Bartlett in 2003 for his “inappropriate treatment of patients with intravenous antibiotics and other medications”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s tweet said Bartlett had used “aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin” to treat children with measles, two drugs Bartlett reportedly &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; were also ingredients in his “magic bullet” treatment for Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bartlett, who ran a short-lived congressional &lt;a href="https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/local/2019/09/27/richard-barlett-odessa-drops-out-congressional-race/3785795002/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, has something of a checkered past. During a lengthy medical career that he has said was “a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Medicine-Man-Confirmed-Miracles/dp/1943127824" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calling from God&lt;/a&gt;”, patients &lt;a href="https://www.mrt.com/news/article/Congressional-candidate-faces-allegations-from-7821914.php" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; of receiving “unnecessary diagnostic tests, medications or treatments”. And in 2021, he received a criminal trespass &lt;a href="https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/bartlett-issued-trespass-warning-at-mch/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; after being caught allegedly rifling through trash bags at an Ector county hospital where he did not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Edwards, meanwhile, has a vaccine-free “wellness practice” at a converted barn building in Seminole where he promotes better nutrition and treats patients with cod liver oil and vitamins to control the measles outbreak, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Like Bartlett, Edwards is an advocate of budesonide, a corticosteroid more commonly used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease – and inhaled to open airways in asthma patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy has previously expressed admiration for the pair, telling&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Fox News&lt;/a&gt; last month that budesonide has produced “very, very good results”, and that patients had experienced “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, Kennedy talked up the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; vaccine during his visit to Texas. He said the purpose of the trip was to comfort the families of Hildebrand and Kayley Fehr, a six-year-old whose death in February was the first from measles in the US in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he said in an earlier&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In early March, I deployed a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] team to bolster local and state capacity for response across multiple Texas regions, supply pharmacies and Texas run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Since that time, the growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations have flattened.

    &lt;p&gt;Scientists, professors, engineers, teachers and doctors are &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/ipsos-veracity-index-2024"&gt;routinely ranked&lt;/a&gt; among the most trustworthy people in society. This is because these professions rely heavily on research, and good research is viewed as the most reliable source of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how trustworthy is research? &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/24/medical-studies-rfk-nih-replication"&gt;Recent news&lt;/a&gt; from the US suggests that the Trump administration wants to fund more &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547546/"&gt;“reproducibility studies”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are studies that check to see if previous results can be repeated and are reliable. The administration’s focus seems to be specifically on studies that revisit the debunked claim of a link between &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj.r642"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a worrying waste of effort, given the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25349/"&gt;extensive evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing that there is no link between vaccines and autism, and the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg2xyyj9w5o"&gt;harm&lt;/a&gt; that suggesting this link can cause. However, the broader idea of funding studies that attempt to repeat earlier research is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-science-reproducibility-crisis-and-what-can-be-done-about-it-74198"&gt;a good one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take research on Alzheimer’s disease as an example. In June 2024, Nature &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533"&gt;retracted a highly cited paper&lt;/a&gt; reporting an important theory relating to the mechanism of the disease. Unfortunately, it took 18 years to spot the errors and retract the paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If influential studies like this were regularly repeated by others, it wouldn’t have taken so long to spot the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07691-8"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt; in the original research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is proving a particularly tricky problem to solve despite the large amounts of money spent researching the disease. Being unable to reproduce key results &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;contributes to this problem&lt;/a&gt; because new research relies on the trustworthiness of earlier research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it has been known for almost ten years that 70% of researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a"&gt;problems reproducing experiments&lt;/a&gt; conducted by other scientists. The problem is particularly acute in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-022-00012-6"&gt;cancer research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/washington-january-30-2025-president-donald-2586170837"&gt;Joshua Sukoff/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Research is difficult to get right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research is complicated and there may be legitimate reasons research findings cannot be reproduced. Mistakes or dishonesty are not necessarily the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In psychology or the social sciences, failure to reproduce results – despite using identical methods – could be due to using different populations, for instance, across different countries or cultures. In physical or medical sciences problems reproducing results could be down to using different equipment, chemicals or measurement techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of research may also not be reproducible simply because the researchers do not fully understand all the complexities of what they are studying. If all the relevant variables (such as genetics and environmental factors) are not understood or even identified, it is unsurprising that very similar experiments can yield different results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, sometimes as much can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2018.10.004"&gt;learned from a negative result&lt;/a&gt; as from a positive one, as this helps inform the design of future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it is helpful to distinguish between reproducing another researcher’s exact results and being given enough information by the original researchers to replicate their experiments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science advances by comparing notes and discussing differences, so researchers must always give enough information in their reports to allow someone else to repeat (replicate) the experiment. This ensures the results can be trusted even if they may not be reproduced exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency is therefore central to &lt;a href="https://ukrio.org/research-integrity/what-is-research-integrity/"&gt;research integrity&lt;/a&gt;, both in terms of trusting the research and trusting the people doing the research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="https://ukrio.org/news/publication-of-research-integrity-a-landscape-study/"&gt;incentive structure&lt;/a&gt; within research doesn’t always encourage such transparency. The “publish or perish” culture and aggressive practices by journals often lead to excessive competition rather than collaboration and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/show-your-working-how-the-open-science-movement-tackles-scientific-misconduct-249020"&gt;open research practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution, as new priorities from the US have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-launches-initiative-double-check-biomedical-studies"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;, is to directly fund researchers to replicate each other’s studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a promising development because most other funding, alongside opportunities to publish in the top journals, is instead linked to novelty. Unfortunately, this encourages researchers to act quickly to produce something unique rather than take their time to conduct &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/reliable-science-takes-time-but-the-current-system-rewards-speed-249497"&gt;thorough and transparent experiments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to move to a system that rewards reliable research rather than just novel research. And part of this comes through rewarding people who focus on replication studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry also plays a part. Companies conducting research and development can sometimes be guilty of throwing a lot of money at a project and then pulling the plug quickly if a product (such as a new medicine) seems not to work. The reason for such failures is often unclear, but the reliability of earlier research is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI177383"&gt;contributing factor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem, companies should be encouraged to replicate some of the original findings (perhaps significant experiments conducted by academics) before proceeding with development. In the long run, this strategy may turn out to be quicker and more efficient than the rapid chopping and changing that occurs now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of the reproducibility, or replicability, problem in research comes as a surprise to the public who have been told to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/24/trust-the-science-is-the-mantra-of-the-covid-crisis-but-what-about-human-fallibility"&gt;“trust the science”&lt;/a&gt;. But over recent years there has been increasing recognition that the &lt;a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/its-time-to-talk-about-research-culture-and-the-ref/"&gt;culture of research&lt;/a&gt; is as important as the experiments themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to be able to “trust the science”, science must be transparent and robustly conducted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what has happened with research looking at the link between vaccines and autism. The topic was so important that in this case the replication studies &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673699001609/fulltext"&gt;were done&lt;/a&gt; and found that there is, in fact, no link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

These play an important role in cardiovascular health, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fish-oil-friend-or-foe-201307126467" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;, eyesight and immune systems. As a result, fish oil supplements have been &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-fish-oil#11-benefits" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; as a way of reducing the risk of heart attacks and inflammation, and improving cognitive function and skin health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This has made fish oil supplements a booming business. Omega-3 supplements are some of the most popular nutritional supplements in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db399.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/supplements.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/fish-oil-market" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; put the value of the global fish oil market around $3.1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2fa2e4b8-11c0-413b-8496-22e3f1015945" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are whole-grain foods really healthier?","elementId":"2fa2e4b8-11c0-413b-8496-22e3f1015945","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/24/are-whole-grains-healthy"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the scientific data isn’t as emphatic. A &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/new-cochrane-health-evidence-challenges-belief-omega-3-supplements-reduce-risk-heart-disease" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2018 meta analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that taking fish oil supplements “does not benefit heart health or reduce our risk of stroke or death by any cause”. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/may/21/fish-oil-may-increase-risk-of-heart-conditions-and-stroke-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; found that fish oil may increase risk of heart conditions and stroke for those without cardiovascular disease. Also, a lot of fish oil supplements seem to be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/revealed-many-common-omega-3-fish-oil-supplements-are-rancid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rancid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We asked experts what to know about fish oil supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-fish-oil-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are fish oil supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fish oil for supplements is extracted from fatty fish such as mackerel, salmon, herring, sardines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/mind-boggling-hidden-cost-ecosystems-obsession-with-fish-oil-pills" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anchovies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This oil is rich in two types of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Aside from fish, seaweed and algae are the only other sources of these two types of omega-3s,” Sherry says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In supplement form, fish oil is often sold as soft gel capsules. However, what each supplement contains – say, how much EPA and DHA are in each pill – is not consistent. In the US, dietary supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, explains Dr Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic. (Supplements &lt;a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/food-supplements#legal-requirements" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;are regulated&lt;/a&gt; in the UK.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You’ve got to turn the bottle around to look at the ingredient label,” Kopecky says. Companies, he warns, “can change their labels week to week”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"da47962f-944b-42fb-bdf5-b6410843d748","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="da47962f-944b-42fb-bdf5-b6410843d748" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-fish-oil-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of fish oil supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts say it is important to differentiate between the benefits of eating fish and the benefits of consuming fish oil supplements. Omega-3s in fish have been shown to help reduce inflammation and plaque formation, lower blood pressure and triglycerides – a type of fat in the blood – and stabilize and protect cell members in the heart and brain, says Sherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But nutrition is complicated. Kopecky says it is unclear whether these benefits come from the omega-3s alone, or a combination of the fatty acids and the way the fish was caught, prepared and served. “There’s all these other factors,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The current fish oil boom is partly attributable to a 1985 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3990713/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine, says Dr Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The paper found that “mortality from coronary heart disease was more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed at least 30g of fish per day than among those who do not eat fish”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Indeed, says Nissen, people who eat more fish tend to have better health outcomes. But it’s probably not just because they consume more omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
