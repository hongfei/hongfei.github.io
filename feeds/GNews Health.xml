A blank whiteboard indicated zero patients during a visit Monday afternoon. But clinic leaders believe it’s a matter of time before it thrives like the locations in Eagan, Vadnais Heights and Woodbury that are staffed with ER doctors and have advanced imaging and lab capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The approach might be overkill for most patients with typical urgent care needs, such as tests for strep throat or persistent cough, but it saves time and money when treating patients with complex conditions who otherwise visit crowded hospitals, said Dr. Craig Matticks, the Urgency Room’s medical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;“What we’re really good at in emergency medicine is figuring out what people have and figuring out what people need,” he said. “We’re bringing that into the outpatient setting for all those patients that don’t actually need immediate, critical interventions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The Urgency Room, a doctor-owned private practice, has grown despite competing in an urgent care marketplace dominated by large multispecialty health systems like Allina Health, HealthPartners and M Health Fairview. Each of the east metro Urgency Room locations treats more than 30,000 patients per year, Matticks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Emergency Physicians P.A.

The medical group started in the east metro to avoid competition with the hospital ERs at which its doctors work on contract, including Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, Southdale Hospital in Edina and North Memorial in Robbinsdale. But Matticks said they had been planning for years to add a west metro location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Physician-owned treatment centers have &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet"&gt;faced criticism from community hospitals&lt;/a&gt; because they often set up in wealthier suburbs and limit their exposure to low-income and uninsured patients. The Urgency Room takes low-income patients covered by Minnesota’s Medical Assistance program and uninsured patients, though they must submit a $350 deposit before receiving care, according to &lt;a href="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;EPPA’s urgent care model is unusual, but it’s responding to the same consumer demands that have resulted in more urgent care clinics nationally and also standalone emergency rooms, said Allan Baumgarten, a &lt;a href="https://allanbaumgarten.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://allanbaumgarten.com/"&gt;Twin Cities analyst&lt;/a&gt; of health care markets.

They may also eat non-food objects or steal from other people's plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marilena Aiello, a neuroscientists who researches the condition, said previously: 'These behaviors are problematic, of course, socially, but also with regard to patients' health as they tend to gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But], some people lose weight because they eat a narrow range of foods in an obsessive way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear why the condition may cause this behavior, but researchers say it is potentially linked to alterations in the body's signals for hunger and fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bruce Willis, pictured above with wife Emma Heming in July 2018, is a sufferer of frontotemporal dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not known whether Bruce Willis suffers from any compulsive eating behaviors as a result of his condition, but his family has said he is struggling with communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15036003/bruce-willis-wife-subtle-symptom-frontotemporal-dementia-diagnosis.html"&gt;And earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, his wife Heming Willis revealed the subtle sign he started to suffer shortly before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/video/bruce-willis-wife-emma-heming-willis-speaks-124980747"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;: 'For someone who is really talkative, very engaged, he was just a little more quiet, and when the family would get together he would kind of just melt a little bit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also soon began losing words, she said, and a stutter he dealt with as a child returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[He] felt very removed, a little cold, not like Bruce, who is very warm and affectionate to going the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, behavioral changes are normally the first noticeable sign of the disease. In Alzheimer's, for comparison, which affects up to 6.7million people,  the first signs are normally memory loss or confusion with time or place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, more areas of the brain degenerate, meaning patients with frontotemporal dementia eventually often mirror those with late-stage Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say that people suffering from the condition may have compulsive eating behaviors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of frontotemporal dementia include difficulty eating or swallowing, trouble walking and being vulnerable to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is not normally fatal on its own, but weakens the body and raises the risk of life-threatening infections or other complications. This may include problems swallowing or eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the disease, although some drugs and therapies may help to slow the progression of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also not clear what causes the dementia, although it has previously been linked to a build-up of protein clumps in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some researchers say it can also be caused by damage to blood vessels in the brain, that they say can affect the supply of nutrients and oxygen to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:10:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQY1d6ZlVrX2pQeHNMUkFuU3hseEdHTVpoVHBCWHVxMDdvSzBzZWxDalBVZ1dQNUt2TzRnUHB5NVhFSGhRQm1hVzdVTkZGSi1qNjgwS1JIZXQ3OU5Ma3pqVlNRbDNaVXFMenRpOVh5QmYxbDF2UXA1ZVZpUjRfZDdHUUVITUZSS2lfdkRHbzFGRURNSzEyM1RKNUJhMTRZMlnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUC1qMDBDT3RtdUVHdm8zLTdJdTRKUE1xZHRVWGVqOHNUSzlfWFBmWmVqRUJRVjNQLUlCZVVxZldpUWxLbnUzaU9lYVdlcDNyd1V1bU9WZW45TXlnc29fNDFoTFBlUW8wYk95SGZVbEUtaXdBc2pFWU5WaDd3cVBCdU5iREFsNEh0ZVlHSUd1eFR0REMwYjVEbllNVjdBdGMwWWJNd20</guid></item><item><title>纽约市宣布第7例死亡宣布后，哈莱姆军团疫情爆发结束- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/7th-person-dies-legionnaires-outbreak-harlem-114-confirmed-cases-rcna227951</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d019d" class="body-graf"&gt;New York City health officials on Friday declared the Harlem Legionnaires’ disease outbreak over, a day after revealing a seventh associated death as the patient count ticked up slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-007cf0" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been no new cases among people who live and work in the affected area since Aug. 9, health officials said, meaning the cluster can be considered ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6066db" class="body-graf"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, which grow in warm water and spread through building water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-407ac5" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, health officials said 90 people were hospitalized throughout the duration of the outbreak, which went back to late July.

&lt;p&gt;COLDWATER, MI (WTVB) – An individual at Coldwater High School was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). The Branch- Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency (BHSJCHA) was recently notified and an investigation has been initiated. BHSJCHA has notified Coldwater High School (CHS), and has confirmed the individual is currently undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHS is working with the health agency  to identify potential students and staff from the Spring Semester of the 2024- 25 school year to determine who should be evaluated for TB infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming week, anyone identified as being potentially exposed to TB will receive a notification with recommendations for testing and a health&lt;br&gt;
questionnaire. BHSJCHA, in partnership with CHS, will communicate how the health questionnaire and testing can be completed. Evaluation and testing through BHSJCHA will be at no cost to family or staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your child are not identified as exposed to TB, no action is required on your part, and testing is not recommended. However, if you choose to seek testing for your peace of mind, you may contact your doctor or the BHSJCHA clinic at 517-279-9561 extension 123.&lt;br&gt;
You should Monitor for TB signs and symptoms in yourself or your child. Although it is cold and flu season, TB symptoms can be different. Active TB disease can cause a cough with or without blood, sweating at night, weight loss or inability to gain weight, low appetite, feeling tired, swollen glands, or chest pain,&lt;br&gt;
among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms can start gradually and not go away for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella review encompassed 248 individual meta-analyses, which synthesized data from over 200 controlled clinical trials involving more than 10,000 autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review evaluated the evidence for 19 complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM) interventions, including oxytocin therapy, melatonin, music therapy, animal-assisted therapy and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also considered polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary supplements theorized to support brain health, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive technique that uses a mild electrical current to modulate brain activity, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), another non-invasive method that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate or inhibit specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain stimulation techniques may help autism by modulating abnormal neural activity, either stimulating underactive areas or inhibiting overactive ones, and improving communication and synchronization between brain regions involved in social, communication, and cognitive functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis also included a wide range of other therapies, such as secretin, a hormone traditionally produced in the small intestine that plays a role in regulating the digestive system. It was used in the 1990s as an experimental treatment for autism, based on the idea that it might improve gastrointestinal issues and, consequently, behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also investigated acupuncture, Chinese medicine, including herbal mixtures and therapeutic massage, various diets, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research found that, on average, 54 percent of autistic people use some form of CAIM. In some studies, this figure was as high as 92 percent over a person's lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers added: ‘However, many studies and international clinical guidelines indicate a lack of efficacy—and, in some cases, adverse events—for this type of intervention in autism.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis evaluated alternative treatments based on their impact on both core symptoms of autism and a wide range of associated behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For core symptoms, the review included social communication impairments, restricted and repetitive behaviors, sensory challenges, and overall symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oxytocin therapy had the strongest evidence but was largely ineffective, showing only a small reduction in repetitive behaviors for autistic adults (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Several other therapies, like music and animal-assisted interventions for children, magnetic stimulation for teens and physical activity for adults, showed promising results, but findings were supported by very low-quality evidence, making their true effectiveness uncertain (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also measured effects on key associated outcomes such as disruptive behaviors, co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD symptoms, adaptive functioning, cognitive abilities, quality of life, and language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study specifically analyzed improvements in sleep quality and quantity as a secondary outcome of crucial importance, ‘given the significance of sleep for autistic individuals and their families that emerged from the screened papers,’ researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at the University of Southampton and co-senior author, said: ‘This study shows that when people want to know whether a treatment is effective, they shouldn’t just look at one single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s essential to consider all the available evidence and how good that evidence is. Drawing conclusions from one low-quality study can be misleading.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also created &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ebiact-database.com/"&gt;an online platform&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier for people to see the evidence they generated on different CAIMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their review WAS published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02256-9#Abs1"&gt;Nature Human Behavior.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Corentin Gosling, associate professor at the Paris Nanterre University and first author of the study, said: 'Ultimately, we hope this tool will support autistic people and practitioners in choosing together the best treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella review did not explicitly recommend any specific therapies over alternative ones. Still, the researchers suggested that the standard of care should be behavioral, educational, and developmental therapies that have a strong evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2000, about 1 in 150 children received an ASD diagnosis; by 2020, that figure had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619253/america-autism-hotspots-data-rampant-epidemic.html"&gt;climbed to 1 in 31&lt;/a&gt;, a near-quadrupling that reflects both greater awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for an autism diagnosis is five, though the vast majority of parents notice developmental delays or atypical behavior in their children, particularly around social skills, as early as two years old. And rates at which children are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14025037/autism-spiked-kids-young-adults-health-experts.html"&gt;being diagnosed have spiked&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825472#:~:text=The%20ASD%20diagnosis%20rate%20was,6.3%20per%201000%20in%202022."&gt;a 2024 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of millions of health records, diagnosis rates climbed 175 percent from 2011 to 2022, increasing from 2.3 to 6.3 per 1,000 people across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant rise was observed in young adults aged 26 to 34, whose rates jumped 450 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, children between the ages of five and eight continue to have the highest diagnosis rate, at 30 per 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A jump in diagnoses has largely been attributed to improvements in screening children, reduced stigma around the diagnosis and greater society-wide awareness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The precise cause of the condition remains unknown, recent studies indicate that environmental influences, such as exposure to pollution, maternal infections during pregnancy, and advanced parental age, may play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Even within the normal range we have a higher risk at low-normal potassium compared to high-normal.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: ‘We have a list of foods that we gave to the patients - white beets, beetroots, cabbage and so on are all high-content potassium-rich diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We did not recommend meat, which is also potassium rich, because it is also rich in sodium and counter-interacts the increase in potassium.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings of the POTCAST trial were simultaneously presented at the conference and published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients helped to increase their potassium intake saw their levels rise from under 4.3 mmol/L to 4.5mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Low potassium increases the risk of arrhythmias and heart failures and death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some 6.7 per cent of the intervention group were hospitalised due to an irregular heartbeat and 3.5 per cent experienced heart failure, compared with 10.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, clinical director at the British Heart Foundation and consultant cardiologist, said: ‘Many people in the UK are living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, commonly known as an ICD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These automatically shock your heart if it goes into an abnormal and life-threatening rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While having a shock may save your life, the experience can be unpleasant for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This trial from Denmark found that increasing blood potassium levels into the high normal range in people with ICDs improved patient outcomes, and importantly reduced their chances of needing a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you’re advised by your doctor to improve your dietary potassium intake, you can do this by including more vegetables and fruit rich in potassium such as spinach, bananas or avocados in your diet, as well as pulses, fish, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Don’t be tempted to try to increase your potassium intake with supplements unless supervised by your doctor, as ending up with too high a potassium level is dangerous – for example it can cause cardiac arrest.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023/24 over 7,000 new ICDs were fitted in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt, banana and tuna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, dietitian Dr Carrie Ruxton said: ‘Everyone knows about cutting down on salt, but few people realise that increasing potassium is almost as important for preventing strokes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The European Food Safety Authority highlighted a lack of potassium across Europe as a major diet concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the UK, the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey shows that a third of teenagers and a quarter of adults are at risk of potassium deficiency, with implications for blood pressure control and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We can do more individually to boost our potassium intakes by eating more fruit, vegetables and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Fruit juices are particularly rich in potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A study published in Nutrients found that starting the day with a glass of orange juice provides 10 to 15 per cent of our daily potassium needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt, banana and tuna.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A banana contains around 500mg of potassium, half a baked potato contains around 600mg and a cup of raw spinach around 450mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institutes of Health recommends that adult males should consume 3,400mg of potassium daily and adult females should consume 2,600mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant or breast feeding women should consume significantly less and should consult a specialist if concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically concentrations of potassium in the blood range from about 3.6 to 5.0 millimoles per litre (mmol/L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;DANE COUNTY, Wis. — The first West Nile virus human case in Dane County was confirmed Thursday, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/wnv-data.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BXNAdMpmZ/" target="_blank"&gt;Public Health Madison and Dane County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late July, the first West Nile virus human case was reported in Barron County. &lt;span&gt;Other human cases have been reported in Rusk and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Sheboygan counties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, this virus is spread to humans and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire WNV by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread directly from person to person, animal to animal, or animal to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most people infected with West Nile virus, about 80%, do not develop symptoms. Those who do typically experience mild illness, such as fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four human cases, two hospitalizations and zero deaths as of Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin DHS has a website that details how people can &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/bite-prevention.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"&gt;avoid mosquito bites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

    &lt;p&gt;Two people have died from eating raw oysters that were contaminated with a flesh-eating bacteria, Louisiana health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria that occurs in warm coastal waters. It is more common between May and October. The bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to contaminated waters, or when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood. Oysters are particularly risky, state health officials &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a July news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can cause life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, which may result in limb amputation, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. About one in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 22 cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection in Louisiana residents, the state department of health said. All of the victims were hospitalized. Four people have died, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the deaths were among people who had eaten raw Louisiana oysters. The other two deaths were among people who reported exposing an open wound to seawater. None of the victims have been identified. One of the victims who ate contaminated oysters was a Louisiana resident. The other lived out of state, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana has been seeing a higher number of Vibrio vulnificus infections and deaths, the state's health department said. During the past 10 years, the state has seen an average of seven infections and one death per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of the bacteria is rising due to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;warming oceans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Earlier this mont, Florida confirmed 13 cases of Vibrio vulnificus across 11 counties. Eight victims died, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/report-13-cases-of-flesh-eating-bacteria-eight-deaths-confirmed-in-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS Miami reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Cases of the bacteria have been reported recently as far north as &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-falmouth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Connecticut and New York. &lt;/p&gt;

Their habits, behaviors, and personality may have shifted slightly, but it can be difficult to piece together what they're feeling if they're not explicitly expressing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, pieces of our daily lives — like our home or the cars we drive — can be more insightful for partners and friends. In fact, if you notice these things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits. Like our bedrooms or living rooms, we spend a ton of time in our cars, and when we're struggling, this might be one of the first places to show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

So, if we're constantly surrounded by clutter, trash, and visual overwhelm, our brain is inevitably going to struggle with otherwise basic tasks like concentration, memory, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a deeper level, this clutter can make internal processes like emotional regulation more difficult. You're also operating from a baseline level of stress, anxiety, and overwhelm that visual clutter cultivates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you consistently notice these things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits — not only because it's clear she doesn't have the time or energy to clean, but because the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-clutter-home-making-you-sick"&gt;clutter itself sets her up for a number of concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/constant-clutter-drains-you-need-these-things-stay-sane"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Constant Clutter Drains You, You Probably Need These 5 Things To Stay Sane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

So, it's not necessarily an immediate sign of internal struggle if your wife has engine lights or oil change needs in her car, but it could be a sign that she needs help managing her workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she doesn't have the time or energy to get an oil change while managing everything else going on in her life, it might be time to rediscuss responsibilities and find a better balance that supports both partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/meaningful-conversations-strong-marriages-built-on"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Meaningful Conversations That Strong Marriages Are Built On, According To Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

They throw things into hidden spaces and push all their visual clutter out of sight, but they also tend to do the same internally — suffering quietly and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/struggles-only-people-who-suppress-their-emotions-understand"&gt;suppressing their complex struggles, emotions, and concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, suppressing emotions doesn't make them go away — they demand to be addressed and acknowledged, similar to the full trunk of a car or an overflowing closet — but it does set these women up for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3939772/" rel="nofollow"&gt;a number of physical and mental health concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-immediately-make-people-feel-uncomfortable-someone-elses-car"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Things That Immediately Make People Feel Uncomfortable In Someone Else's Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

If you notice crumbs and stains from eating in your wife's car, she may be struggling more than she admits — struggling to find time for mindful eating at home, cooking and making nutritious meals, and crafting her day without rushing around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be a sign that she needs support with responsibilities, but it could also be a red flag that she's struggling with her eating habits. If she's always finding comfort or solace in fast food in her car or overconsumption outside of the house, it could be time for a conversation about better habits, support, or even professional help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-people-tell-your-house-dirty-even-if-you-clean-before-come-over"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Ways People Can Tell Your House Is Dirty, Even If You Clean Up Before They Come Over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

From handling childcare, to dealing with work, planning and organizing things at home, and doing chores, it's a lot to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's not just emotional and physical exhaustion that taking on this household, emotional, and mental labor sparks, but also a number of other long-term issues like a reduced capacity for willpower, struggles with long-term decisions, anxiety, and chronic stress, like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10148620/" rel="nofollow"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you notice these things in your wife's car, they could be innocent — simply trackers and organizers — but they could also be a sign of chaos, that she's struggling more than she admits with planning and overseeing everything in your and your children's lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/examples-emotional-labor-women-do-private-keep-relationships-working"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Examples Of Emotional Labor That Women Do In Private To Keep Their Relationships Working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

Not only can these be signs of things like overspending or seeking emotional coping through financial habits, it's likely a sign of disconnection in the marriage — from partners that feel drawn to hiding things from each other when it comes to money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially if there are bills that haven't been discussed or aren't known to both partners in a marriage, these can only amplify that turmoil that couples experience around financial insecurity in their relationships — holding the power to "mute" couple's communication patterns, like &lt;a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1430" rel="nofollow"&gt;a study from the Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/a&gt; suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-high-iqs-usually-have-these-things-their-car"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People With High IQs Usually Have These 11 Things In Their Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns across countries. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s behind the trend?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person’s choice of spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These are just two of the reasons that the signs of pancreas problems can slip by unnoticed or attributed to a different illness or condition. Considering that this is the norm, it doesn't come as much of a shock that pancreatic cancer has such a &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low survival rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;low survival rate&lt;/a&gt; and that problems like pancreatitis can be so difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Part of the reason survival rates are so low is that identifying pancreatic cancer early is difficult," said &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/andrew-hendifar-546093.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Andrew Hendifar, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Andrew Hendifar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of pancreatic cancer at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.

While symptoms of pancreas issues can be persnickety, both Dr. Epperly and Dr. Hendifar say there are a handful of warning signs that warrant a call to your doctor. Here are some of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Pale, floating stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you notice your stool is light colored and floating, that's a sign of poor nutrient absorption because of a pancreas malfunction. "The enzymes your pancreas produces help you digest fats in your diet," Dr. Hendifar explained. Along with breaking down fats, your pancreas helps your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins like A, E, and K, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When pancreatic disease messes with your organ's ability to properly manufacture those enzymes, the result is feces that looks paler and is less dense. You may also notice your poop is oily or greasy. "The toilet water will have a film that looks like oil," Dr. Hendifar said. That's the dietary fat your body failed to break down, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you notice your poop looks funky now and then, that's no reason to freak out. But if all or most of your bowel movements have these characteristics, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Radiating back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms of both pancreatic cancer and acute pancreatitis, which is a type of deadly inflammation, Dr. Hendifar said. But that pain manifests in different ways depending on the underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If the pain seems to start in your middle before "radiating" into your mid or lower back—and if it lingers for weeks—that may be a sign of pancreatic cancer, Dr. Epperly said. Also, if you've already seen your doctor and he or she has prescribed a type of drug called a proton-pump inhibitor—such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium)—let your doc know if your symptoms don't improve. Dr. Hendifar said it's common for doctors to mistake pancreatic cancer–triggered pain for reflux or other GI issues, many of which a proton-pump inhibitor should help resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the other hand, if the pain comes on suddenly and is intense and focused in the middle of your abdomen, that's the type associated with acute pancreatitis (sudden, temporary inflammation of the pancreas), Dr. Epperly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, it's important to remember that a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of health issues—some serious, but many mild—can cause &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stomach aches or pain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;stomach aches or pain&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar added. But if either of the descriptions above sound familiar and you haven't found a way to get relief, it's best to give your doctor a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;An unexpected diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; produces hormones like insulin and glucagon that help maintain healthy levels of sugar in your bloodstream. When the pancreas is imperiled, it's common for sufferers to develop &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar said, because the production of these hormones will be thrown out of whack. If your weight is under control and you eat a healthy diet, a new diabetes diagnosis should lead to a closer examination of your pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The same holds for a diabetes sufferer who suddenly finds her disease harder to manage, even if she is doing all the right things. "Those sudden changes in diabetes status without an obvious explanation, those are things we see associated with pancreatic cancer," Dr. Hendifar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Nausea from high-fat foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nausea and vomiting are symptoms to watch out for—particularly if you've been eating fatty foods, Dr. Hendifar said. Again, because your pancreas produces enzymes that help your digestive system break down fat, diseases that mess with your pancreas tend to disrupt your body's fat-digesting capabilities, which leads to nausea. "Hamburgers are often nausea triggers, and so are avocados and nuts, which are all high in fat," Dr. Hendifar added. "Pizza is another one that's really tough for patients with a compromised pancreas." Dr. Epperly said pancreatitis is more likely than pancreatic cancer to lead to sudden vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Rapid weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's tempting to credit your new diet, especially if you're actively trying to lose weight. But if you're shedding weight—and especially if you're experiencing the radiating pain described above—that weight loss could be due to the digestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer or disease, Dr. Hendifar said. A recent study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lww.com%2Fctg%2Ffulltext%2F2020%2F12000%2Fassessment_of_weight_loss_and_gastrointestinal.20.aspx&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65926888%2Fsigns-of-pancreas-problems%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that among people who had acute pancreatitis, 24% had lost over 10% of their body weight a year after their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65595473/subtle-thyroid-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thyroid issues;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Thyroid issues&lt;/a&gt; and some other health conditions can also cause rapid or unexplained weight loss. In any case, you should see someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Additional reporting by the Editors of Prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Quick, say the first thing that pops into your head when you read the word "pancreas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you said "cancer," you're not alone.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications, particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics, and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers tested acetaminophen, commonly used to relieve fevers, and ibuprofen, commonly found in flu medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other drugs tested in the study included diclofenac, an arthritis treatment, furosemid, to treat high blood pressure, metformin, to control high blood sugar, atorvastatin, to reduce cholesterol, tramadol, a strong painkiller, temazepam, used to treat sleep problems, and pseudoephedrine, a decongestant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drugs contain different active ingredients and do not contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists placed the drugs in a petri dish alongside varying concentrations of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, the first-line of defense against bacterial infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria E.coli, commonly found in human intestines and often behind recalls of contaminated food, was added and the dishes were heated for 20 hours to&lt;span&gt; 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), to mirror the temperature in the human body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results showed that when bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside acetaminophen and ibuprofen, the bacteria developed more mutations than when just exposed to ciprofloxacin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This helped the bacteria grow faster and become highly resistant to the antibiotic, as well as to multiple antibiotics from different classes.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="15043123" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15043123/painkiller-advil-tylenol-antibiotic-resistance.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the lab tests, the scientists used E.coli, a common bacteria often found in the human gastrointestinal tract (stock photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 9.9million people are prescribed ibuprofen in the US every year, estimates suggest, with millions of others taking the drug over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 52million people take acetaminophen in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC said there are about 2.8million antibiotic resistant infections in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 35,000 people also die from these infections annually, according to estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization had previously warned that antibiotic resistance 'threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections' and that it is 'an urgent public health threat'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections that are resistant to these drugs are often referred to as 'super infections'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was revealed in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44259-025-00144-w#Sec14"&gt;Nature: Antimicrobials and Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbits with horn-like growths shooting out of their heads and faces have been spotted in northern Wisconsin and other states, inspiring an internet frenzy over the “mutant” bunnies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sightings of the unfortunate furry critters occur every year, but they’ve sparked national attention after photos of the bunnies in Colorado went viral this month. On social media, people have dubbed the rabbits “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1mqq35k/my_girlfriend_saw_this_frankenstein_bunny_in/"&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/a&gt;” bunnies or likened them to zombies in the HBO series “The Last of Us.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they may look like something out of a horror flick, disease experts say the virus causing the wart-like growths isn’t a sign of the end times. The rabbits are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, according to Nancy Businga, wildlife disease specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That can, of course, be very eye-catching and very strange-looking to people that haven’t seen it before. And we do, every year, get a few random reports of these rabbits with these lesions,” Businga said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Businga said there’s been a slight uptick in sightings this year in northwestern Wisconsin. The agency has received eight reports of 23 rabbits in St. Croix, Dunn, Pierce and Polk counties. Last year, the agency only received one report of the virus affecting rabbits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Lambert is an oncology professor and director of the McArdle Lab for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Lambert, who studies human papillomavirus, said the Shope virus was the first tumor virus ever discovered. American physician and animal pathologist &lt;a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/richard-e-shope/2332-albert-lasker-award/"&gt;Richard E. Shope&lt;/a&gt; first identified the virus in the 1930s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is not a bloodborne pathogen,” Lambert said. “This virus, papillomaviruses, is transmitted by exposure on the skin.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lambert said the virus is mostly benign and the warts usually go away as the animal’s immune system fights off the infection. In a small percentage of humans, infections may not resolve from sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses and could pose a risk of cancer.  More than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4517131/"&gt;300 papillomaviruses&lt;/a&gt; have been identified, including more than 200 human papillomaviruses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is not new. It’s just that pictures of these rabbits draw interest because they look kind of bizarre,” Lambert said. “The &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/stories/worlds-scariest-rabbit"&gt;jackalope&lt;/a&gt; has been around for as long as I can remember and as a mystical creature that was to reflect the taxidermist version of these rabbits with horns.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kristen Bernard, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, said the Shope virus cannot be transmitted to humans. However, she said, the virus can be transmitted by insects and ticks among wildlife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s because when the insect bites that area of an animal to blood feed like a tick does, like a mosquito does, it gets the virus on its mouth parts, and then goes and feeds on another animal and transmits the virus mechanically that way,” Bernard said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Businga said an increase in sightings of the virus may be tied to warmer weather for a longer portion of the year, which is favorable for insects like mosquitoes and ticks. While some have speculated that climate change may play a role in increased sightings, Lambert said evidence is lacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I believe in climate change, but I’m not aware of any epidemiological study that has demonstrated that climate change is increasing the incidence of papillomavirus infections in animals or in humans,” Lambert said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bernard said there is evidence of diseases from ticks and mosquitoes spreading due to climate change, but it’s anyone’s guess whether it’s playing a role in the spread of the Shope virus among rabbits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I wouldn’t say there’s strong evidence, but I wouldn’t be surprised if climate change increased the amount of this in the summer months due to that mechanical transmission by insects,” Bernard said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rabbits aren’t the only animals in Wisconsin that have been spotted with growths due to papillomaviruses. People have also reported a few sightings of papillomaviruses  in deer and a couple affecting squirrels this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If people spot animals with papillomaviruses, Bernard urged them to use caution when handling sick wildlife. While the virus can’t be transmitted to humans or pets, rabbits may have other diseases that can spread to humans including tularemia or rabbit fever. They can also infect domestic rabbits with the virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People can report sick wildlife to the DNR by filling out a form on the agency’s &lt;a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/WildlifeHabitat/wildlifehealth"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 608-267-0866.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The story has been updated to more accurately reflect comments from the DNR’s Nancy Businga on warmer weather possibly affecting the spread of the Shope papillomavirus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-31azim-0 eBMXOi nextSwipeIgnore"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU sc-wlmftc-0 ccDPKb"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iBjbcX"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-66833"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”. Add a couple of short full-body &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions into the mix and you have a decent &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/short-workouts-plan-fitness-dan-john-b2737277.html"&gt;minimalist workout plan&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your step count became the ultimate modern humblebrag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 juTIZT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-66834"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Harry Bullmore/The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential drawbacks of the Japanese Walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the information above paints the Japanese walking method in a favourable light – as it should, with the protocol delivering impressive results in a non-intimidating time-span. However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 09:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPQzhJSDYtNm5ma3YwTC00ck9Sb0JBdXE5TVREaVpobkVkdFowY3dOTjAxSEVXR0RUUElDeHZjVm9COUt3Q0drc0xsdF9Ga3JmOHpURzdYS2pXTUJhQUh3T0pRTzdHWER3OU1OUHZjNjZtdzNmMnZsT0ZoT3BnZU51bThvNE9QWXZyUXlxNkRCM0tIdDVkWVl4YzhXeHJmWTk2WUVJakxJSQ</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：神经外科医生拒绝为NPH患者分流-底特律新闻</title><link>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/08/29/dr-roach-neurosurgeon-refuses-to-put-in-a-shunt-for-person-with-nph/85757901007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I have normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and had a spinal tap a few months ago. It helped my brain fog, but my neurosurgeon didn't want to put in a shunt. I am 96. Can repeated taps help me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— M.G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear M.G.:&lt;/strong&gt; NPH is a condition where the fluid inside the brain has a high pressure. It is unknown why this happens, but symptoms include an abnormal gait and incontinence along with the brain fog you mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When NPH is suspected, a spinal tap is a useful diagnostic test. Taking a lot of spinal fluid out, which suspends the brain and spinal cord, will temporarily lower the pressure, and if a person's symptoms (especially their walk) get immediately better, this is a strong sign that the diagnosis is NPH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unfortunately the pressure builds back up within a few days, so the cure might be even worse than the disease if you needed a spinal tap every few days. There are no medications that have been proven to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This leads me to wonder why your neurosurgeon didn't want to do the shunt, which is the definitive treatment for NPH. A shunt drains spinal fluid into the abdomen, allowing the pressure to stay low. It's the one treatment that improves a person's function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While I understand that operating on the brain at age 96 has the possibility for complications, NPH tends to worsen over time. Perhaps a second opinion would be wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I read a recent column where you addressed the perils of microplastic polymer particles. Please elaborate on which bodily illnesses/problems arise as a result of this problem and how it manifests itself within our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— C.C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear C.C.:&lt;/strong&gt; There aren't good studies that have yet determined the risk from microplastics. While they have been suspected of causing harm in multiple organ systems, the magnitude of the harm isn't well-understood in humans. In particular, the digestive system may be affected through chronic inflammation and changes in the microbiome. The lungs may have reduced gas exchange. There may be changes in male reproductive health, and there is concern but not proof of an increased cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I find it frustrating that there is information about the potential harms of microplastics but not enough good evidence to estimate what the risk might be. However, until these risks are better known, there are a few steps to help reduce exposure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;— Change plastic water bottles for glass or steel. Tap water has less microplastics than bottled water.— Don't microwave foods in plastic.— Use glass or ceramic containers for storage.— Avoid highly processed foods.— Vacuum your living space with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter.— Use home-filtration devices that have very small filters (about 0.2 micrometers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Most of this advice is good for either you or the environment (or both), so taking this advice won't be a waste. Most of the work that needs to be done to reduce microplastics in the environment needs to happen at a systems level. For example, among the largest root causes of microplastics is oceanic plastic debris. Solving this is beyond my capacity.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to

class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A CT scan of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;52-year-old man’s brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who complained of worsening &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;medication-resistant migraines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; over a period of four months, revealed the presence of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;tapeworm larvae-filled cysts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;—an illness doctors blamed on his lifelong love of undercooked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;bacon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition, known in scientific circles as Neurocysticercosis, is caused by pig tapeworms, which infect humans through either eating pork or consuming contaminated food and water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="post-highlights"&gt;&lt;span class="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 52-year-old man’s CT scan revealed tapeworm larvae-filled cysts in his brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition, neurocysticercosis, was linked to his habit of eating undercooked bacon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disease remains most common in countries where pigs are a primary food source.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors arrived at the conclusion after it was established that the patient had not traveled to any high-risk areas where Neurocysticercosis is common, which are typically countries with poor sanitation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The patient denied visiting areas where the disease was

that when occurring as Neurocysticercosis in the brain, along with pre–existing conditions like migraines, it is easy to miss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The latter is despite the fact that Neurocysticercosis has existed since the 13th century, when civilizations like the Greeks associated it with eating pork. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, Cysticercosis is virtually non-existent in countries where the animals are banned, and as the publication states, this further highlights “the strong link between swine and this disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

When Drury's son developed Pandas more than a decade ago, she was willing to pay thousands of dollars for his first IVIG treatment – which, she says, "brought him back to us". The experience prompted her to become an advocate, pushing for a state law that requires insurers to cover treatments including IVIG for Pans/Pandas patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Charlie's Law" &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/life-stages-populations/maternal-child-family-health-services/pandas-pans.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;passed in Illinois in 2017&lt;/a&gt; – but to this day, Drury says, it can be a struggle to get the right treatments for her son, who is now 20. Charlie has had long periods of remission, but also multiple severe flare ups. Clinicians have told him he will need regular IVIG infusions, as well as plasma exchange therapy, for the rest of his life, says Drury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We'd be in these hospitals and they're like, 'We can't help you'," Drury says. "Even though there's a law in his name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pans and Pandas are today recognised by global health authorities – the World Health Organization has added Pandas &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://icd10cmtool.cdc.gov/?fy=FY2021&amp;amp;query=PANDAS" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;to its disease classification system&lt;/a&gt;, for example – and researchers and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://panspandasuk.org/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;patient support groups across the world&lt;/a&gt; are working to improve quality of care and access to it. In the UK, Pans and Pandas were the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-09-12/debates/C36138AE-6DB4-4DA9-84E1-C50C0F9C0A82/PANSAndPANDAS" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;subject of a 2023 parliamentary hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But skepticism still remains in some areas.

&lt;p id="af44b7fa-623b-4488-9591-61b4d7fc9135"&gt;Knee pain can be frustrating, especially when it prevents you from exercising. When recovering from a knee injury or dealing with mild knee pain, it's crucial to strengthen the muscles around the knee so that the joint has sufficient support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/physio_san_/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/physio_san_/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Sanjit Kooner&lt;/a&gt; is a physical therapist and he says he recommends isometric holds to a lot of his clients who have knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="af44b7fa-623b-4488-9591-61b4d7fc9135-2"&gt;"The two isometric holds [below] are designed to help reduce knee pain and build strength without aggravating symptoms," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises will be particularly helpful if you suffer from knee pain while running or lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These moves primarily target the quadriceps, which play a key role in patellar stability [the positioning of the kneecap]. They also engage supporting muscles in the hips and calves, depending on the variation," Krooner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises that the moves are appropriate for lots of musculoskeletal issues, but it’s still best to consult a health professional before trying these moves if you have severe pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-sanjit-kooner-s-isometric-exercises-for-knee-pain" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-sanjit-kooner-s-isometric-exercises-for-knee-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do Sanjit Kooner's isometric exercises for knee pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="45b95bf1-2c99-4dfc-bff7-c7333abd5a96"&gt;You'll need to stand by a fixed surface, like a wall, to do these exercises.

From there, bend your knees towards the floor in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For beginners, try a shallower knee bend for reduced joint load. For a more advanced variation, deepen the knee bend to increase muscle activation and strength gains. This is suitable when pain levels are low and movement is well tolerated," he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second position involves pressing the hamstring of one leg into a foam roller against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner recommends holding each position for 20 to 45 seconds for two to four sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aim to do these moves 3 to 5 times per week, often early in a strength session or as part of rehab," he recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As with any exercise, depth and duration should be adjusted for comfort, and it’s best to stop if pain worsens and seek professional guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-why-are-isometric-holds-so-beneficial-for-knee-pain" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-are-isometric-holds-so-beneficial-for-knee-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why are isometric holds so beneficial for knee pain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="0d7a809c-c519-435d-96f8-3e1c331f0870"&gt;"Isometric exercises involve holding a position under tension without moving the joint, which not only strengthens muscles but can also help calm down the nervous system’s sensitivity to movement in a painful area," Krooner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that doing an isometric hold could provide immediate knee pain relief for some people, as this sensitivity decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When an area is irritated, the nervous system can become more protective, sometimes interpreting normal movement as a threat. Isometric contractions provide a safe, controlled way to load the muscles and joints without rapid or excessive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, this repeated, low-threat loading can desensitize the area, reduce pain perception, and restore confidence in movement," Krooner says.&lt;/p&gt;

If effective, it could help curb the opioid crisis by providing a powerful alternative. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discovery of a new painkiller offers relief with fewer side effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphine and other opioids are commonly used in medicine because of their strong ability to relieve pain. Yet, they also pose significant risks, including respiratory depression and drug dependence. To limit these dangers, Japan enforces strict rules that allow only specially authorized physicians to prescribe such medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the United States saw widespread prescribing of the opioid OxyContin, which fueled a rise in the misuse of synthetic opioids like &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;fentanyl&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid drug that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It is used to treat severe pain, such as pain from cancer or surgery, and is typically administered via injection or transdermal patch. Fentanyl can also be used recreationally, and its use has been linked to a significant increase in opioid overdose deaths in recent years. Due to its high potency, fentanyl can be dangerous even in small doses, and its use should be closely monitored by a healthcare provider.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/span&gt;. By 2023, deaths from opioid overdoses had exceeded 80,000, marking the escalation of a nationwide public health emergency now known as the “opioid crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A new analgesic approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opioids may soon face competition. Researchers at &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/kyoto-university/"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt; have identified a new analgesic, named &lt;em&gt;ADRIANA&lt;/em&gt;, that provides pain relief through a completely different biological pathway. The drug is now moving through clinical development as part of an international research collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If successfully commercialized, ADRIANA would offer a new pain management option that does not rely on opioids, contributing significantly to the reduction of opioid use in clinical settings,” says corresponding author Masatoshi Hagiwara, a specially-appointed professor at Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Targeting adrenoceptors for safer pain relief&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew their initial inspiration from compounds that imitate noradrenaline, a chemical released during life-threatening situations that activates α2A-adrenoceptors to reduce pain. While effective, these compounds carry a high risk of destabilizing cardiovascular function. By examining the relationship between noradrenaline levels and α2B-adrenoceptors, the team proposed that selectively blocking α2B-adrenoceptors could increase noradrenaline activity, stimulate α2A-adrenoceptors, and provide pain relief without triggering cardiovascular instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_491043" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491043" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-491043" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-777x298.jpg" alt="Mechanism of Pain Relief by ADRIANA" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-777x298.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-400x153.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-768x295.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-1536x589.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-150x58.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-450x173.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-1200x460.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA.jpg 1825w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-491043" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mechanism of pain relief by ADRIANA. Credit: KyotoU / Hagiwara lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the scientists used a specialized method called the TGFα shedding assay, which allowed them to measure the function of different α2-adrenoceptor subtypes. Through compound screening, they succeeded in identifying the world’s first selective α2B-adrenoceptor antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Promising clinical results and future trials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After success in administering the compound to mice and conducting non-clinical studies to assess its safety, physician-led clinical trials were conducted at Kyoto University Hospital. Both the Phase I trial in healthy volunteers and the Phase II trial in patients with postoperative pain following lung cancer surgery yielded highly promising results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on these outcomes, preparations are now underway for a large-scale Phase II clinical trial in the United States, in collaboration with BTB Therapeutics, Inc, a Kyoto University-originated venture company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Japan’s first non-opioid analgesic, ADRIANA has the potential not only to relieve severe pain for patients worldwide but could also play a meaningful role in addressing the opioid crisis — a pressing social issue in the United States — and thus contribute to international public health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aim to evaluate the analgesic effects of ADRIANA across various types of pain and ultimately make this treatment accessible to a broader population of patients suffering from chronic pain,” says Hagiwara.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., which doesn’t recommend the shots for healthy children of any age but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians. Kennedy was an anti-vaccine activist before joining the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The conflicting advice was followed by President Donald Trump's &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/08/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-is-out-after-less-than-a-month-on-the-job-federal-officials-say/85856653007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; for what her attorneys said was standing up for science.

"And so my advice to parents is really lean on your health care provider."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, for its part, &lt;a href="/story/news/local/michigan/2025/07/29/michigan-officials-recommend-covid-19-shots-for-pregnant-mothers-kids/85409150007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;announced in July&lt;/a&gt; that it's continuing to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Communications Director Andrew Nixon contended that Americans "deserve confidence" that medical recommendations are "based solely on science and public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We call on the AAP to strengthen conflict-of-interest safeguards and keep its publications free from financial influence, ensuring every recommendation reflects only the best interests of America’s children," Nixon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement that her organization is "transparent about our funders," follows rigorous conflict-of-interest disclosures and maintains safeguards to "ensure the integrity and independence of our guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We welcome an opportunity to sit down with the Secretary to review our recommendations and restore our seat at the table," said Kressly, whose group and other medical groups sued Kennedy in July for making unilateral, unscientific changes to federal vaccine policy they said are an “assault on science, public health and evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The revamped COVID-19 vaccines target a newer version of the virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they’ll be able to get one, with access dependent on decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ferndale mom Christina Renkert, 39, called the FDA's decision to limit access to the vaccine "a terrible political move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I think it's stupid they're limiting it for anyone," Renkert said. "I mean, if people want to get the vaccine, I don't understand why they're telling them not to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Warren resident Matthew Wallin said he has been against COVID-19 vaccines since "Day 1." His daughters, who are 5 and 7, haven't gotten the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are not about getting those shots," Wallin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;AAP's advice for very young children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP recommends all kids ages 6 to 23 months get vaccinated against COVID-19. The organization noted that the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization for children under 2 years is the highest among pediatric age groups, and the rate for kids 6-23 months of age is comparable with that of people 50-64 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP's recommendations are developed by pediatricians who have expertise in infectious diseases and are based on the science in this area, said Dr. Lynn Smitherman, a pediatrician at Wayne Pediatrics in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They take a painstaking amount of time and detail to gather information to … make these recommendations when it comes to vaccines," said Smitherman, who is a member-at-large of the Board of Directors of the Michigan Chapter of the AAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Children under 6 months of age may still have protection from maternal antibodies, and researchers haven't really been able to study the vaccine's safety and efficacy for kids under 6 months, she said. But for children 6 months to 2 years old, many are now back in daycare after the COVID-19 pandemic, some may have siblings and some might have caregivers who are older and ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"That's why this particular population is being targeted, because of the exposure and their potential of spreading disease among more vulnerable people as well," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Schein, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Michigan State University, said that when COVID-19 first appeared, health providers found that children were disproportionately less affected by the disease. Most children had minor symptoms and weren't severely ill, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, a small portion of children and adults had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), a condition associated with the virus that causes COVID-19. These kids had over-aggressive immune responses that caused very severe illness and a few deaths before physicians figured out how to treat it, Schein said. In MIS, different body parts become inflamed, such as the heart, lungs and kidneys, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Schein noted that there weren't any cases of MIS in children who had been vaccinated before they had COVID-19 for the first time. That's why the AAP is recommending vaccinating kids 6 months to 2 years of age, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"That's the group that's at risk for that most severe immune response, and that's what we're trying to protect people from," Schein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Guidance for other children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP also recommended a single dose of the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine for children 2-18 years old who are at high risk of severe COVID-19; reside in long-term care facilities or other congregate settings; have never been vaccinated; or have household contacts at high risk for severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP said kids who are not in these groups but whose parents or guardians want their children protected from COVID-19 should be offered a single dose of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Smitherman said "the bottom line" is that the AAP feels everyone should be vaccinated. She noted that children at high risk, including those with asthma and immune disorders, "should definitely be immunized" with the current vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"And those that are otherwise healthy, they're still recommending that they strongly consider being vaccinated with the current vaccine, just to be on the safe side," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Guzmán said the Oakland County Health Division doesn't issue vaccine guidance or recommendations, but it has "standing orders" from the division's medical director that give registered nurses the legal authority to act on the division's behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Our standing orders will reflect the AAP guidance that anyone coming in for a COVID vaccine shall not be turned away," she said. "And we will stick with that because we feel really importantly that the protection that the COVID-19 vaccine offers is important to everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;With the AAP announcement last week, "the main confusion" is whether insurance companies are going to pay for vaccines for people not in the CDC's recommended groups, Guzman said. She encouraged families to seek out their local health department. The departments give out vaccines "on a sliding fee scale," Guzman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Macomb County Health Officer Andrew Cox said his health department knows that vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, are "very effective" at limiting severe illness and severe hospitalizations, so the agency will continue to promote those vaccines. The health department typically follows the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services' guidance and supports their recommendations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The state health department, which recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for every person 6 months and older, said the vaccine was approved following rigorous testing and safety review processes, including clinical trials and review by medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"To protect and promote the health and safety of all residents, we encourage everyone to stay up to date on all vaccinations," said Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;HHS criticizes AAP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Trump administration is pushing back against the medical establishment, including the lawsuits they have filed against certain administration moves. Nixon with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the AAP is "undermining national immunization policymaking with baseless political attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Secretary Kennedy has stood firm in his commitment to science, transparency, and restoring public trust," he said. "By bypassing the CDC’s advisory process and freelancing its own recommendations, while smearing those who demand accountability, the AAP is putting commercial interests ahead of public health and politics above America’s children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP's Kressly said her organization created its vaccine schedule based on the health of children and "the evidence showing how vaccines support their immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts," she said in a statement about social media posts made by Kennedy. "For nearly a century, the American Academy of Pediatrics' mission has focused on one thing: following the science to best protect children's health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She noted that the AAP's immunization recommendations are rooted in decades of peer-reviewed science by the nation's leading health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On Wednesday, the FDA narrowed updated COVID-19 shots' use for children and young adults to those with at least one high-risk health condition. Additionally, Pfizer’s vaccine will no longer be available for any child under age 5, after the FDA said it was revoking the shot’s emergency authorization for that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Parents still can seek shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company’s Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kressly said Wednesday's announcement proposing to limit the availability of COVID-19 vaccines for children and young adults is "deeply troubling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Any parent who wants their child vaccinated should have access to this vaccine; today’s unprecedented action from HHS not only prevents this option for many families, but adds further confusion and stress for parents trying to make the best choices for their children," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What parents think&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For parents, the conflicting guidance means they'll have to decide which advice to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wallin, the Warren dad, said he has been anti-vaccine since his childhood, as his mother is opposed to vaccines. His mother beat cancer through holistic approaches, and he also uses holistic medicine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847378007-img-2313.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=495&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847378007-img-2313.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=990&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Warren resident Matthew Wallin plays with his daughter, Charlie, right, and Cameron, left, at the playground at the Red Oaks Youth Soccer Complex in Madison Heights on Monday.

I guess it really depends on that, too," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wallin said he decided not to vaccinate his daughters against COVID-19 because of his concerns about vaccines in general and because of how quickly the COVID-19 vaccine was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I'd rather see how it does and the longevity of it, or something like that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Renkert, the Ferndale mom, said her daughter has been vaccinated against COVID-19, and she and her husband plan to immunize her and themselves again this fall. She said they will wait to hear if their daughter can get the vaccine, as she doesn't have a health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The family plans to pay for the vaccine out-of-pocket if their health insurance doesn't cover it, Renkert said. She noted that her husband had open-heart surgery in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's the sort of thing where we don't feel the need to take unnecessary risks with something like that," Renkert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847439007-img-2323.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=495&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847439007-img-2323.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=990&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Christina Renkert of Ferndale said Monday she and her husband plan to vaccinate their daughter and themselves against COVID-19 this fall."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Christina Renkert of Ferndale said Monday she and her husband plan to vaccinate their daughter and themselves against COVID-19 this fall." data-c-credit="Anne Snabes/The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Playing with her daughter recently at Royal Oak's Lawson Park, she said she and her husband have been "believers of the vaccine" since it came out and are believers in "science and data and all of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Potential confusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wayne Pediatrics' Smitherman said she has seen confusion among parents about the federal government's recommendations and about COVID-19 vaccines in general. She said she is spending more time explaining and justifying the need for vaccines overall, not just the COVID-19 one, than she did previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vaccination rates overall have declined in Michigan since 2019. Michigan health officials have said Michigan's coverage for the routine childhood immunization series was around 75% in 2019; it's now around 70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;COVID-19 vaccination rates are even lower, according to state figures. Quarterly immunization report cards for every county in the state showed 1.5% of kids 6 months to 17 years old were fully vaccinated for COVID as of June 2025 in Macomb County, 3.3% in Wayne County and 5.5% in Oakland. Statewide, 5% of children aged 5 to 15 and 3% of children under 5 received the 2024-2025 updated COVID-19 vaccine as of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Smitherman said she wants parents to feel comfortable with the health care decisions they're making for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"And I have no problem sitting down and talking to them and explaining my point of view," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is a lot of misinformation about potential side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"And trying to debunk all of that information can be, it can be tiring sometimes," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Guzmán, Oakland County’s health officer, said that those with a primary care provider should "lean on them, trust in them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For families without a provider, she hopes they can lean on the Oakland County Health Division. The division has a nurse on-call hotline — (800) 848-5533 — and nurses can provide information on vaccines, Guzman said. Families can also walk into the division's health centers and get answers to their questions, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I'm really hoping that in this time of confusion and uncertainty, the public health departments can be a steadfast resource for everyone in the community, so that families aren't trying to find their own information and going online and just Google searching things, right?" Guzman said.

			&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long relied on measurements like &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00879.x"&gt;body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratios&lt;/a&gt; to assess health risks. However, researchers are increasingly focusing their attention on an unexpected indicator: neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thick neck might project strength, like that of heavyweight boxers or rugby players, but studies suggest it could signal a concerning health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMI, which divides weight by height to estimate body fat, doesn't always tell the complete story. A competitive bodybuilder might have a high BMI, but clearly isn't obese. This is where neck circumference offers additional insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-obesity-definition-shifts-focus-from-bmi-heres-the-science-behind-it"&gt;New Obesity Definition Shifts Focus From BMI – Here's The Science Behind It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that people with larger necks relative to their body size face increased risks of several serious health conditions. The connection lies in what neck size reveals about fat distribution, particularly in the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fat around your &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.90357.2008"&gt;upper body&lt;/a&gt; releases fatty acids into your blood, which can interfere with how your body manages cholesterol, blood sugar and heart rhythm. Essentially, neck circumference serves as a proxy for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-022-01160-w"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; – the harmful fat that wraps around your organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence linking neck size to health problems is striking. People with thicker necks show increased rates of several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870319300511"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526072/"&gt;Atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning. This condition causes irregular heartbeat and blood flow, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2397836"&gt;blood clots and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The electrical imbalance in the heart can eventually progress to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neck circumference also correlates with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743524000148"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, where the main arteries to the heart narrow and restrict oxygen-rich blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cardiovascular problems aren't the only concern. Larger neck circumference increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01111-z"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/correlation-between-neck-circumference-and-gestational-diabetes-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DMSO"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="172490" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious long-term complications, including vision loss and limb amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a connection to sleep disorders. Thick necks have been linked to &lt;a href="https://medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/883776"&gt;obstructive sleep apnoea&lt;/a&gt;, where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This condition causes extreme daytime fatigue and strains the cardiovascular system. People with sleep apnoea face higher risks of &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/14/3971"&gt;car accidents&lt;/a&gt; due to their exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what constitutes a risky neck size? For men, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;17 inches (43 cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater increases health risks. For women, the threshold is &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;14 inches (35.5 cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172496" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642.jpg" alt="back of a woman's neck" class="wp-image-172496 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172496" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Anything above a 14-inch circumference neck size in women may indicate health risks. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEcTuxCZUg/"&gt;Miriam Alonso/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most surprisingly, these risks persist even in people with normal BMI. You could have a healthy weight according to traditional measures, but still face elevated health risks due to neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for each &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/16/6/664/7564829"&gt;additional centimetre&lt;/a&gt; of neck circumference beyond these thresholds, death rates and hospitalisation rates increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your neck measures above these thresholds, it's not cause for panic – but it is worth taking seriously. Neck size represents just one piece of your overall health picture, but it's an important one that's often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that neck circumference can change with lifestyle modifications. Cardiovascular exercise and weight training can help reduce upper-body fat. Quality sleep supports metabolic regulation and recovery. A balanced diet rich in pulses, fruits, and vegetables provides essential nutrients without excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring your neck takes seconds with a tape measure. Simply wrap it around the narrowest part of your neck, ensuring the tape is snug but not tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172499" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642.jpg" alt="measuring man's neck" class="wp-image-172499 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172499" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Measuring your neck with a tape measure is easy.

While neck circumference shouldn't replace other health assessments, it offers another tool for understanding your cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era where we're constantly seeking better ways to predict and prevent disease, sometimes the answers are literally right in front of us. Your neck might be revealing more about your health than you realise – and it's worth paying attention.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263483/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Known as the “silent assassin,” it often creeps in quietly. You feel fine, yet the force in your arteries runs high day after day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top number, called systolic pressure, is the one doctors watch most closely because it signals how hard your heart is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-you-position-your-arm-can-alter-blood-pressure-readings-according-to-scientists/"&gt;working with each beat&lt;/a&gt;. Even a small nudge downward can lower the odds of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have a wide range of medicines that help, but picking the right plan isn’t easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pill or two? Standard dose or higher? Different drug classes or more of the same? People want clear answers before they commit to a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an innovative &lt;a href="https://www.bpmodel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood Pressure Treatment Efficacy Calculator&lt;/a&gt; enables doctors to predict how much different medications are likely to lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comprehensive-blood-pressure-study"&gt;Comprehensive blood pressure study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers pulled together the highest-quality evidence available: 484 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with 104,176 participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start, average blood pressure hovered around 154/100 mm Hg. Follow-up lasted roughly nine weeks – long enough to see the full effect in a setting where participants took the medicine as prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked direct questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drop can you usually count on from a single standard-dose drug? What happens if you double that dose? What if you combine two different drug classes? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used those answers to build a simple way to predict average results for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;common choices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-show"&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single blood pressure medicine at a standard dose lowered &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic pressure&lt;/a&gt; by 8.7 mm Hg on average. Doubling the dose added about 1.5 mm Hg – modest rather than a big change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some drug classes showed more gain with higher doses, especially calcium channel blockers; &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/art-20044522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; changed little when the dose increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing two different drug classes – each at a standard dose – produced a larger effect: a 14.9 mm Hg average drop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubling both components added another 2.5 mm Hg. Adding a second drug class was around four times more effective than doubling the dose of a single medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clear-target-many-choices"&gt;Clear target, many choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really important because every 1mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure lowers your risk of heart attack or stroke by two percent,” said Nelson Wang, cardiologist and Research Fellow at &lt;a href="https://www.georgeinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The George Institute for Global Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But with dozens of drugs, multiple doses per drug, and most patients needing two or more drugs, there are literally thousands of possible options, and no easy way to work out how effective they are,” Wang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure changes from moment to moment, day to day and by season – these random fluctuations can easily be as big or larger than the changes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;brought about by treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, measurement practices are often not perfect, bringing in an additional source of uncertainty – this means it’s very hard to reliably assess how well a medicine is working just by taking repeated measurements,” Wang continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-baseline-impact"&gt;Blood pressure baseline impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;Starting pressure&lt;/a&gt; matters. Across single-drug regimens, for every 10 mm Hg lower at baseline, the expected drop decreases by about 1.3 mm Hg. Treatment still works at lower baseline pressures; there’s simply less excess pressure to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make decisions easier, the team grouped treatment “intensity” by predicted systolic reduction: low (&amp;lt;10 mm Hg), moderate (10–19 mm Hg), and high (≥20 mm Hg). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most single drugs at standard doses fall into the low category. Many two-drug combinations land in the moderate range, and certain higher-dose pairs or three-drug mixes reach high intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-predicting-combinations"&gt;Predicting combinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis didn’t stop at describing past trials. Using averages from single-drug studies, the researchers predicted the effects of two-drug combinations and compared those predictions with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-5-minutes-of-daily-exercise-can-lower-blood-pressure/"&gt;real trial results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The match was strong, with a correlation of about 0.76, suggesting that the calculator offers a realistic expectation for most common pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Rodgers, Senior Professorial Fellow at The George Institute for Global Health, noted that hypertension is a top reason for clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, clinicians haven’t had one up-to-date source that shows how effective different medicines are – especially in combinations or at varying doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using the [&lt;a href="https://www.bpmodel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood Pressure Treatment Efficacy Calculator&lt;/a&gt;] challenges the traditional ‘start low, go slow, measure and judge’ approach to treatment, which comes with the high probability of being misled by BP readings, inertia setting in or the burden on patients being too much,” Rodgers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this new method you specify how much you need to lower blood pressure, choose an ideal treatment plan to achieve that based on the evidence, and get the patient started on that ideally sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-all-means"&gt;What it all means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone needs only a small nudge downward, a single medicine at a standard dose is often sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the goal is a bigger change – about 15 to 20 points – adding a second drug class usually gets there more reliably than pushing a single drug to higher doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That matches &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lasers-and-light-replace-the-cuff-in-blood-pressure-breakthrough-scos/"&gt;real-world experience&lt;/a&gt; in clinics where most patients need more than one medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because expected effects depend on baseline, the same regimen appears more potent when baseline pressure is high and slightly less potent when it is closer to the goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensity tiers give clinicians a quick yardstick to match treatment to the needed reduction, and then fine-tune based on side effects, other conditions, and ongoing home or clinic readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-blood-pressure-treatment"&gt;Future of blood pressure treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the enormous scale of this challenge, even modest improvements will have a large public health impact – increasing the percentage of people whose hypertension is under control globally to just 50% could save many millions of lives,” Professor Rodgers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small changes matter. A standard-dose medicine typically lowers systolic pressure by a meaningful amount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because lower systolic pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, selecting an evidence-based regimen using the intensity framework and calculator can help bring pressure into a safer zone over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00991-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 01:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNMzVqSE5Camt2R1VFSkxnSnZwUkdZWmJEaC14a3IxMWxuLWdmY0NUbHJuM0tleXk5NzJ1MkVaZDBtclVlMFkwX1lwQmpTVDZ1R0cyd2x2ZnY5Vk5mOGVWbXJuZTRlSldLT251N19wOC1UZmQxeDVJN3BRRmlCbk1rWlhkWW9jRXhrNFItX1JZUXlFTlltNU1zM1RVU2g5SV9sekdHdW53blRHd0tTdmxlS1JB</guid></item><item><title>CVS推迟在16个州提供新冠疫苗--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/cvs-pharmacy-covid-vaccine-16-states.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 01:05:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPYVZLMFVETkpNblhXSHNDUGpFNHM0TENNUHgtSDl3MFRPU0UyaEZaRlBUOE1zbVA3ekZEcWlqVjVTUzduWFVkdXJGalZsazBaaXg3SU1VZWU3dW1ocC1BNERWVkN5MVp0cllUZUY5UVNMbUZadnJMd1pYeGhDN3dTdGM0SGU1aUUt</guid></item><item><title>Redding餐厅的员工在芬太尼危机期间做好准备， Narcan在手- KRCR</title><link>https://krcrtv.com/news/local/redding-restaurant-staff-prepare-for-fentanyl-crisis-with-narcan-on-hand</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;REDDING, Calif. — &lt;/span&gt;Employees at a Redding restaurant and bar are staying prepared as they say they’re seeing the dangers of the fentanyl epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At The Shack in Redding, employees keep a ready supply of Narcan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartender and server Julie Mason said this is provided by a local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their staff members all know how to use the medication to help someone experiencing an opioid overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason believes all bars and gas stations should have it on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people are using fentanyl, and they’re dying from it every single day,” Mason said. “It's so, so important because you could save somebody's life.

Ashland.news photo by Bob Palermini&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;His colleague, Baures, was setting a trap this week and found one sitting on a leaf and snapped a photo of it. So far, the duo haven’t seen high numbers of aegypti compared to last year in Talent, though none have been found in Talent this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Partin and Baures said last summer’s public awareness campaign to stamp out aegypti in Talent has paid off, and they’re hoping for the same response in Ashland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen a huge cultural shift in Talent,” Partin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talent was the first area in Oregon where aegypti were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they prefer human blood, the aegypti are most active during the day and are aggressive biters, feeding on ankles, wrists and elbows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can lay larvae in 1/4-inch of standing water.  Marsha MacCormack, who lives near Clay Street, let Partin and Baures set up traps in her shady backyard with a creek flowing through the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacCormack said she makes sure she has no standing water in her yard to discourage all mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re miserable little critters,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacCormack said she makes sure she has no standing water in her yard to discourage all mosquitoes from breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re miserable little critters,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64020" data-srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-768x431.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64020" srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623149-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Jackson County Vector Ecologist Andrew Partin and technician Joe Baures were in Ashland on Thursday morning to collect traps they had deployed on Wednesday.

The netting is pulled out and placed into a plastic bag, where it is frozen back at the lab so it can be inspected. Carbon dioxide is pumped into the canister and a small scent device adds extra enticement for the aegypti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s supposed to mimic how an organism, in this case a human, helps attract the mosquitoes,” Baures said.  The mosquitoes prefer older, established neighborhoods with shade trees and more vegetated backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aegypti were found in California for the first time in 2013, and by 2020, they were discovered in Redding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 2022, the aegypti have exploded in Redding,” Partin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" data-srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Mosquito Control employees put hang cards on neighborhood doors to warn of the presence of day-biting mosquitoes.

Davis sponsors summer internship programs, which helped to train Baures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilio DeBess, state public health veterinarian in the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, said aegypti’s discovery in Oregon is a concern because the species has been more common in much warmer climates of the United States, Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mosquitoes have been known carry and transmit diseases that are more typical to warmer climates, such as Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever,” DeBess said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, DeBess emphasized that the risk of these infections to local residents is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Acquiring these diseases depends on the presence or arrival of someone who is currently infected with one of the diseases after infection outside the United States,” DeBess said in a news release. “As was the case when Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were first found in Oregon in 2024, there have been no reports of anyone having acquired viruses associated with Ae. aegypti from within the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Staying safe&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-left"&gt;Residents can take these steps to help prevent the spread of aegypti:&lt;br&gt;    • Dumping or draining any standing water around the home.&lt;br&gt;    • Removing containers or objects that can hold water from your yard, such as water saucers from under plants, old tires, tarps, buckets, containers, toys, and other equipment.&lt;br&gt;    • Repairing leaky outdoor faucets.&lt;br&gt;    • Keeping rain gutters cleared.&lt;br&gt;    • Covering, screening, or removing rain barrels, trashcans, bins, buckets, or tubs.&lt;br&gt;    • Wearing mosquito repellent outside. Repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, some lemon eucalyptus, and para-menthane-diol products are most effective at preventing mosquito bites.&lt;br&gt;    • Sleeping under a mosquito net when outside or in a room without screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reach freelance writer Damian Mann at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e2a232f2020202b393d0e29232f2722602d2123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d2b6bfb3bcbcbcb7a5a192b5bfb3bbbefcb1bdbf"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related story: &lt;a href="https://ashland.news/oregon-officials-find-mosquito-that-can-transmit-deadly-viruses-in-southern-oregon/"&gt;Oregon officials find mosquito that can transmit deadly viruses in Southern Oregon&lt;/a&gt; (Aug. 31, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ashland News</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:57:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE91VTBHOWRnejhYTUMyTlI2TngwdGdIc0w5ZnlXLUVfb3BpY2QxQ0pMQnUxejN6OHVXOXRmazJQX0t3d1RjdFhjNFl3LWdySS1pYWJVeXo5Y1JVNU5fY3V3NEd6RGIzaFkyVU4wVGtVVnJLZw</guid></item><item><title>居民对蚊子传播的衰弱性疾病的担忧加剧： “扩展到新地区” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/concerns-rise-resident-comes-down-233000518.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In summer 2025, a Hong Kong resident developed symptoms of the mosquito-borne illness chikungunya — the first time the area had seen a case in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The illness chikungunya is primarily transmitted via mosquito bites. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/hong-kong-sees-first-mosquito-borne-illness-from-china-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bloomberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; reported that a 12-year-old developed a rash, fever, and significant joint pain after traveling to Foshan, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In previous weeks, the city of Foshan had reported over 6,500 infections, which had officials worried about the spread, per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department used mosquito control techniques at the patient's home. Bloomberg reported that the actions included fogging, removing stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes, and increasing public awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although the infection doesn't generally spread between people (except in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/php/transmission/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rare cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rare cases&lt;/a&gt; from mother to child or via infected blood), Bloomberg explained that mosquitoes that bite an infected person can transmit the virus to another person they bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is the increase in vector-borne diseases important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While chikungunya is often contained to specific regions, rising temperatures and extreme weather changes are contributing to its spread, along with the spread of other vector-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many areas are seeing rare cases or surges in mosquito-borne viruses, including the Bay Area, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A rise in global temperatures and changing weather patterns are making it easier for mosquitoes to breed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Warmer temperatures and increased rainfall are helping Aedes mosquitoes expand into new regions," explained one doctor from the infectious diseases division at the University of Texas, per &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/chikungunya-virus-amid-new-outbreak-china/story?id=124410753" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ABC News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/4-5-2023-rising-cases-experts-discuss-chikungunya-spread-americas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pan American Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has stated that disease-carrying mosquitoes have become more common in recent years in areas where they didn't previously survive.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCCORDSVILLE, Ind. — Some &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/local" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;McCordsville&lt;/a&gt; residents have concerns about power lines being built right in front of their home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John and Christa Sweezy moved into their home in 2012. Christa has epilepsy — developed after a boating accident earlier in life that caused a traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was in a coma for two weeks, and then since then I've had seizures," Christa Sweezy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used to be frequent — a couple a month from 2012 to 2014 — but she has only had one episode in the last 11 years and controls them with medication. They said new power lines being built so close to their home could increase Christa's risk of having another episode.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's important that they hear how big of a concern it is for us," Christa Sweezy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AES Indiana has a proposed power line along the road they live on. It is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.aesindiana.com/winding-ridge-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Winding Ridge Transmission and Substation Interconnection Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's got to be 50 feet, 60 feet from the front of our home," John Sweezy said. "That's not a viable solution for us to stay here."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3659130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2013 National Institutes of Health study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;looked at the effects of exposure to different frequencies of electromagnetic waves in various durations. It was found that acute exposure to those waves may facilitate epileptic seizures — possibly independent of exposure time.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John said he looked at studies like these to see how his wife could be affected if these power lines are built. He added that he wants AES Indiana to consider alternatives like other routes that would avoid his home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I want there to be action behind the person who hears it — that's what we're looking for. We're looking for somebody to change this so that we don't have to leave here," John Sweezy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If necessary, John said they will move if it is what is best for Christa — a stay-at-home mother who homeschools their two kids. However, they plan to stay in that home forever if they can.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13News received this statement from AES Indiana:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AES Indiana is committed to the safety of all of our customers. The State of Indiana and the Federal Government do not have maximum limits for EMF and Magnetic Field levels for electric lines. Calculations to the residential structure for both Electric and Magnetic Fields associated with this line fall well below even the most stringent state standards, where they exist."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Public Health Nurse Kristy Polden said it is most common in daycares. She advises schools and daycares to employ good sanitation strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It lives on surfaces, is highly contagious and can be contracted through diaper changes," she said. "Always wash your hands and have kids wash their hands before they are eating or doing any activities and touching their faces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polden explained that the Health Department does not track Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease due to the lack of a definitive test for it. She said symptoms include fatigue, fever, blisters and rashes. The department said its best to check with a health clinic to treat HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff said the most common illness during back-to-school time is the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanitizing surfaces and regular hand washing are key prevention methods. Polden suggested that young kids can learn how long to wash their hands by singing the alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, what we eat plays a big role in brain health. Diets like the Mediterranean diet, rich in whole grains, fish, fruits and vegetables, have been shown to protect against diseases like dementia by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-eat-every-week-for-better-brain-health-11784254" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supporting brain function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But more research is needed to understand how specific foods affect cognitive function in older adults with multiple health conditions. To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers recently explored how different types of food impact cognitive symptoms in older adults with multiple health conditions, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was The Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study used data from the 2017–2018 China Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS), a large-scale project led by Peking University to study older adults in China. The survey, conducted seven times between 1998 and 2018, collected detailed information on health, lifestyle and diet from participants aged 65 and older. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, researchers focused on 3,443 older adults with multiple chronic conditions and available data on cognitive function and food consumption. Food intake was measured using a simple questionnaire that asked how often participants ate 13 specific foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy, with responses ranging from "almost every day" to "rarely or never." Cognitive function was assessed using a test called the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which evaluates memory, attention, language and more, with scores adjusted for education level to define cognitive impairment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study also looked at multimorbidity, defined as having two or more chronic conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or arthritis. Researchers analyzed how food consumption and cognitive function are connected using advanced statistical tools called network analysis. This method visualizes relationships as a web, where symptoms and variables are "nodes," and their connections are "edges." Thicker edges show stronger links, and colors (green or red) indicate positive or negative associations. The analysis identified the most influential symptoms (central nodes) and bridging symptoms that connect different clusters, helping pinpoint areas for intervention. The study also tested the reliability of these findings using statistical methods to ensure the results were stable and accurate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Within the cognitive abilities group, attention and calculation were most closely linked to language skills, while memory and recall abilities also had a strong connection. On the food side, two foods had the strongest links. They were: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;nut products (like almonds or walnuts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mushrooms or algae (such as seaweed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some foods stood out as particularly influential in the network. Mushrooms or algae had the highest impact, followed by dairy products and nut products, showing their central role in supporting cognitive health. When looking at how food and cognitive abilities interact, fresh fruits were most strongly connected to orientation ability (knowing time, place, etc.), followed by fresh vegetables. Fresh vegetables also had the least influence in the food group, and orientation ability was the least connected in the cognitive group—meaning that veggies are less likely to influence the kinds of foods you eat and orientation ability is less likely to affect other parts of cognition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study offers fresh insights into how different foods relate to specific cognitive abilities, it does have a few limitations. First, because it’s based on a snapshot in time—using a cross-sectional design—we can’t say for sure whether eating certain foods directly improves cognitive function or if other factors are at play. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, the data relies on participants’ memory to report their food habits and cognitive abilities, which could introduce some inaccuracies. Lastly, even though the study included a nationally representative sample, the findings might not fully apply to certain regions or specific groups of people. Future research with diverse populations will be important to confirm and expand on these results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study highlights the powerful role that food can play in supporting brain health, especially for older adults dealing with multiple chronic health conditions. For example, incorporating more mushrooms, nuts and dairy products into your diet could have a meaningful impact on cognitive abilities like memory and attention. These foods were found to be particularly influential in the study, suggesting they may help bridge the gap between physical health and brain function. Even simple changes, like adding a handful of walnuts to your yogurt or adding mushrooms to your burger or stir fry, could be a step toward better cognitive health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings also emphasize the importance of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-diet-to-reach-70-study-11703981" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;holistic approach to aging&lt;/a&gt; healthfully. Cognitive health doesn’t exist in isolation; it’s closely tied to physical health and lifestyle choices. By focusing on nutrient-rich foods that reduce inflammation and support brain function, older adults can potentially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and improve their quality of life. While more research is needed to confirm these connections and explore how specific foods impact brain health over time, this study provides a practical starting point. It’s a reminder that what we eat matters, not just for our bodies but for our minds, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;small, intentional dietary changes&lt;/a&gt; can make a big difference as we age.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By analyzing data from a large-scale survey, researchers identified specific foods, like mushrooms, nuts and dairy products, that play a central role in supporting brain function. These findings suggest that certain dietary choices may help improve cognitive abilities such as memory and attention, while also highlighting the complex relationship between physical and mental health. Although the study doesn’t prove cause and effect, it provides valuable insights into how food can influence brain health and offers a foundation for future research.&lt;br&gt;
