&lt;h2&gt;Key Facts&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its outbreak had grown to 198 cases of measles as of Friday, with 23 of the patients having been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just five of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the sick patients being unvaccinated (80) or having an unknown vaccination status (113).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the New Mexico Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" aria-label="said"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; a deceased man in Lea County who was unvaccinated against measles tested positive for the virus, though they said he did not seek medical care before passing and “the official cause of death is still under investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lea County, New Mexico, is home to all 30 of the state’s confirmed measles cases, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 137 of the measles cases are located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (29), Dawson County (9), Yoakum County (8), Dallam County (5), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (3), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 64 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 34 were reported among adults over age 18. The ages of 11 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Are There Outbreaks In Other States?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an outbreak in New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="30 cases"&gt;30 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Lea County, which is on the border with Texas. Outside of Texas and New Mexico, anywhere from one to nine cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="reported by the CDC"&gt;reported by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in California, Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Are Measles Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;SEMINOLE, Texas – Last Saturday, Zach Holbrooks walked into a mobile measles screening and vaccine clinic he had helped set up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://southplainshealth.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Plains Public Health District&lt;/a&gt;, which includes Gaines County, he dropped by to check on how many shots the crew had given out so far that day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Has it been busy today?" Holbrooks asked the two staffers in what's normally a livestock show barn on the outskirts of downtown Seminole. "Not so far. We've only given one," they replied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks works and lives in this town, the county seat, which in the last few weeks became the epicenter of the largest measles outbreak in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, March 4, one 6-year-old unvaccinated child had died of the measles. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;159 confirmed cases and 22 hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, but local health authorities say the true total is likely much higher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says outbreaks tend to occur when the vaccination rate&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxPawOGro$" target="_blank"&gt; in a community dips below 95%&lt;/a&gt;. The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella on record in Gaines County sits at 82%, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;state health records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many children there are homeschooled or attend private primary school, so those rates could be even lower.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks has been busy since the outbreak started in late January. He's been setting up mobile testing and vaccination sites; he said this remote part of West Texas has a large immigrant population, many whose immunization records are unknown, so he's been circulating flyers with measles information in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a mix of people out here, a large German speaking population, Spanish speaking population," which he said makes getting residents the right information about disease control even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Authorities still don't know how the measles got to Seminole, but John Belcher, the town's former mayor, said he understands why it's spreading beyond the city limits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Folks who live out here basically have to drive everywhere, he said. They hop in the car or truck and drive miles to get groceries, go to doctor's appointments, attend church and to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'd say within 200 miles, maybe even farther, if there's a metal building out there, it came from products manufactured in Gaines County," Belcher said. "And the building was probably put together by companies from Gaines County."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People here need to drive about 80 miles to catch a flight at the Lubbock Airport.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others travel often to nearby communities in Lea County, on the New Mexico side of the state line. That state has &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxrvRiLIE$" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 10 confirmed measles cases. On Thursday, New Mexico Health officials confirmed that an unvaccinated adult testing positive for the virus has died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-52432" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A sense of normalcy&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Seminole, the outbreak has mainly infected children since early January.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Local authorities say the Mennonite community has been hit hard by measles, though they don't have an exact number of confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Grub Shack, a restaurant owned and run by a Mennonite family, seems to be running at full steam. Other businesses in downtown Seminole and people just carry on with their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many Mennonites immigrated here in the late 1970s. There remain thousands of Mennonites in Seminole some 50 years later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tina Siemens' father moved his family here from northern Mexico in 1976 when she was 8. She was raised Mennonite and manages the &lt;a href="https://wtlhm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas Living Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the history of this part of West Texas' Native American and Mennonite heritage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many Mennonites are not against vaccines in principle, Siemens said, some seek other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The Mennonites are very keen on home remedies," Siemens said. "So there may be a family that, nobody knows that they might have all had the measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The state's health officials have said there's plenty of vaccine for everyone who needs it, and Holbrooks said he doesn't think it's a lack of access to the vaccine that's spreading measles out here.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At last count, 214 people in Gaines County have been vaccinated for measles since the outbreak. Holbrooks believes that number is not higher because some people fear debunked ideas about its safety.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just think there's some vaccine hesitancy, even more so since COVID," Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-50709" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the measles vaccine is safe and two doses prevent infection, not just severe illness, 97% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Julie Carter has lived in Seminole all her life. Her three kids are adults: 19, 22 and 30 years old. They got the measles vaccine before starting elementary school, but she became a vaccine skeptic when she started researching ways to improve her health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was overweight; I wasn't feeling good," Carter said. "I kind of went on a journey where I got educated. I came across the vaccine thing and wasn't sure how healthy those were."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health officials say doubts about vaccines continue to hamper vaccination efforts. Plus, this illness has not been a major public health issue. In 2000, the CDC declared the virus eliminated from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said that for a lot of younger parents, measles is a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not something that people thought a lot about," he said. But he's urging those in the community to do just that because the consequences can be severe. "If it was just a simple rash, a rash won't lead to brain inflammation, intellectual disability, death, pneumonia, deafness, convulsions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles, one of the most contagious known viruses, can spread for days without a person feeling sick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Two people have now died in the growing measles outbreak in west Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New Mexico Health officials on Thursday confirmed the death of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;The first death was a school-age child&lt;/a&gt; in Gaines County, Texas last week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;News of a second death comes as infectious disease doctors worry that the federal government's messaging about the outbreak is putting more emphasis on treatments like vitamin A than on vaccination, even as misinformation about some of these treatments is spreading online.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those concerns come in the wake of recent comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy addressed the growing measles outbreak in an editorial for FOX News published on Sunday, also &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20a%20highly%20contagious,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes" target="_blank"&gt;posted on the HHS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While mentioning the value of vaccination for community immunity, Kennedy said "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one." He emphasized treatment for measles, saying that vitamin A can "dramatically" reduce deaths from the disease. In an&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" target="_blank"&gt; interview with FOX News&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, he said Texas doctors are giving steroids and cod liver oil to their measles patients and "getting very, very, good results."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his editorial, he said good nutrition is "a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That emphasis on nutrition and vitamin A to treat measles is concerning some infectious disease doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Mentions of cod liver oil and vitamins [are] just distracting people away from what the single message should be, which is to increase the vaccination rate, " said&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Amesh Adalja, &lt;/a&gt;an infectious disease physician and senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While vitamin A can play a role in preventing severe disease, discussion of vitamins, "doesn't replace the fact that measles is a preventable disease. And really, the way to deal with a measles outbreak is to vaccinate people against measles," says&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Adam Ratner, &lt;/a&gt;a member of the infectious disease committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy did acknowledge that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;measles is highly contagious &lt;/a&gt;and that it poses health risks, especially to people who are not vaccinated. He said vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also protect people who can't be vaccinated. But he didn't strongly encourage people to get their children vaccinated — which is usually a key part of the public health response during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 2019, when a measles outbreak was raging in the U.S., then health secretary Alex Azar &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/24/716953746/cdc-reports-largest-u-s-measles-outbreak-since-year-2000" target="_blank"&gt;came out with a statement&lt;/a&gt; strongly supporting vaccination and warning of the risks of under-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to vitamin A, studies conducted decades ago in low and middle-income countries found that the vitamin can reduce the risk of severe disease and death, in children who are malnourished and have vitamin deficiencies, says Adalja.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's also evidence that, even in the absence of a pre-existing deficiency, measles seems to deplete the body's stores of vitamin A. Both&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" target="_blank"&gt; the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend giving two doses of vitamin A to children who have the disease, especially if they are so sick they are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, Ratner stresses that vitamin A does not &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A false idea circulating online is that giving children high doses over long periods of time can prevent measles, says Ratner. He says that's not only wrong but can be quite dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Vitamin A can accumulate in the body," he says. "It can be toxic to the liver. It can have effects that you don't want for your child," like liver damage, fatigue, hair loss and headaches. Ratner works as a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City. He says that similar misinformation about vitamin A made the rounds during the city's measles outbreak in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott Weaver, &lt;a href="https://microbiology.utmb.edu/faculty/scott-weaver-phd" target="_blank"&gt;director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says he worries people might look at a vitamin bottle and think, "Well, maybe if I take two or three times this amount, I'll be even better protected against measles.&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm concerned that people think that vitamin A or other nutrition is a substitute for vaccination to prevent infection and to prevent spread," Weaver says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In his Fox News interview, Kennedy said Texas doctors are "getting very, very, good results." with a mix of treatments including steroids and cod liver oil. NPR has not confirmed the use of cod liver oil in Texas, but Adalja says, "there's no data that cod liver oil is going to have any benefit on measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And because cod liver oil is so high in vitamin A, Ratner worries parents could end up giving their children too much – potentially toxic amounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adalja would have liked Kennedy to emphasize that&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" target="_blank"&gt; vaccines are the best defense against measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Then you don't even have to think about treatment, because when it comes to an infectious disease, prevention is always better than treatment," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We all know sleep is important, but it takes up so much time. With responsibilities and diversions still looming from our waking life, the urge to skimp on sleep can be powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet as a new study suggests, even a single night of sleep deprivation may cause significant upheaval in the immune system, potentially contributing to the development of conditions like obesity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="153478" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;perils of chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; are widely known, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-a-lack-of-sleep-can-mess-with-your-emotions"&gt;mood changes&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive impairments to health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/six-to-eight-hours-sleep-best-for-heart-cardiovascular-health"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is abundant evidence linking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-important-reason-disturbed-sleep-makes-everything-hurt-more"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; with these and other ailments, and abundant evidence suggesting health problems like these are commonly driven by chronic inflammation, the authors of the new study point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is less evidence, however, about the specific mechanisms involved: How exactly could sleep deprivation lead to the systemic inflammation that goes on to impair people's health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers from the Dasman Diabetes Institute in Kuwait sought to understand the influence of sleep deprivation on circulating immune cells, such as monocytes, and its association with systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monocytes are large leukocytes, or white blood cells, that play key roles in the innate immune system, which provides the body's first line of defense against intruders. There are three subsets of monocytes in humans: classical, non-classical, and intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes patrol for pathogens in vasculature and extravascular tissues, the study's authors explain, using inflammatory cues to help them regulate the body's immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 276 healthy Kuwaiti adults with varying body mass indices (BMIs), 237 of whom ended up completing the study. They analyzed the subjects' sleep patterns, and monitored their blood for levels of different monocyte subsets as well as inflammation markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obese participants had significantly lower sleep quality than leaner participants, the study found, along with higher chronic low-grade inflammation. They also had more non-classical monocytes, which correlated with lower sleep quality and increased pro-inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another part of the study, five healthy, lean adults submitted blood samples throughout a 24-hour period of sleep deprivation. These were compared to control blood samples taken after the participants had had a few days of refreshing sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just 24 hours of sleep deprivation apparently altered the monocyte profiles in lean participants to resemble those of obese participants, a condition the researchers note is known to promote chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg" alt="person working late at computer" class="size-full wp-image-153551" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer-600x361.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tillwe/2634026113/"&gt;Till Westermayer/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer may seem obvious – just get more sleep – but it's rarely that simple in real life. Modern civilization conspires to keep us up late, argues lead author Fatema Al-Rashed, a researcher at the Dasman Diabetes Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings underscore a growing public health challenge. Advancements in technology, prolonged screen time, and shifting societal norms are increasingly disruptive to regular sleeping hours," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This disruption in sleep has profound implications for immune health and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research should continue this examination of the links between sleep deprivation and immune changes, Al-Rashed and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also hope to learn if any interventions might help mitigate this effect, such as structured sleep therapies or guidelines for limiting use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, we aim for this research to drive policies and strategies that recognize the critical role of sleep in public health," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We envision workplace reforms and educational campaigns promoting better sleep practices, particularly for populations at risk of sleep disruption due to technological and occupational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, this could help mitigate the burden of inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases," she &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A 3D-printed penis implant has restored erectile function to rabbits and pigs in a world first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs with damage to their penile tissue that received the one-of-a-kind surgery not only achieved erections, their rates of successfully producing offspring increased from 25 percent to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penis has one of the most complex vascular network structures in the human body. For years now, researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590183424000127"&gt;working on a model&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis"&gt;corpus cavernosum&lt;/a&gt;, the spongy tissue of the penile shaft, that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reverse-erectile-dysfunction-in-pigs-using-synthetic-tissue"&gt;could help those with erectile defects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent study by a team from China, the US, and Japan presents a new physiological model that can reproduce erections in large, living animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the model, researchers mimicked the corpus cavernosum through the creation of a hydrogel-based scaffolding – one that is strong enough to withstand the internal pressure when the structure fills with blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png" alt="Biomimetic Penis" class="size-medium wp-image-154200" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-768x277.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-600x216.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis.png 1294w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Images of the full biomimetic penis model with a (i) front view (ii), side view (iii), and partial section view. (Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then seeded the scaffolding with pig or rabbit endothelial cells, which are the main cells that line blood vessels. Endothelial cells (ECs) can create an "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10066672/"&gt;adaptable life-support system&lt;/a&gt;" in vessel-rich tissues, helping restore and improve function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea out in the corpus cavernosum of Bama pigs and New Zealand rabbits, researchers implanted the hydrogel and ECs into dozens of animals with erectile defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rabbits and pigs received the artificial penis implant &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; ECs, but those that received the ECs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the implant showed better erectile function overall. In fact, their outcomes approached that of an animal without erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings indicate that the implants markedly improved functional recovery, and the combination with ECs further enhanced this effect, demonstrating notable improvements in tissue regeneration and functional recovery," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by biological engineer Zhenxing Wang from South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fertility of the EC groups demonstrates the recovery of erectile function and the ability to ejaculate, suggesting the restoration of the cavernous tissue in the treated males."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Repair" class="size-medium wp-image-154212" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-856x415.png 856w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-768x373.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-600x291.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects.png 1336w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption-text"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="154179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; images of 4 different rabbit groups: defect, implantation, ECs + implantation, and normal cavernosum (normal).

(Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs that received the EC model, for instance, showed low inflammation levels after surgery, and as the hydrogel scaffolding degraded at the defect site, new tissue progressively formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pigs were allowed to breed a few weeks after surgery, pregnancy rates rose from just 25 percent in the defect group to 75 percent in the implant without ECs group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male pigs that received the implant with ECs successfully impregnated every single female pig they mated with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Pigs" class="size-medium wp-image-154214" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1024x247.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-768x185.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1536x370.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-600x145.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis.png 1992w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schematic diagram of the procedure for implanting the model into a defect made on the pig corpus cavernosum. (Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new penis model may prove useful in the future treatment of human &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-condition-may-double-risk-of-erectile-dysfunction-study-finds"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; and diseases that scar the deeper tissues of the penis, causing painful erections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also help inform the development of other artificial, vessel-rich organs, like the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Currently, developing transplant materials that support nerve regeneration and effectively integrate with the host's urethra and vascular networks presents a major challenge," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These approaches could help overcome current obstacles in repairing large-scale penile injuries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154215" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-642x690.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Implant" class="size-medium wp-image-154215" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-642x690.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-386x415.png 386w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-768x825.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-600x645.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigPenisImplant.png 968w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154215" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Two weeks after implantation, the implanted model allowed recovery of a normal penis shape in pigs with corpus cavernosum defects during erection.

(Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that more than half of men aged 40 to 70 experience mild to moderate erectile dysfunction that increases with age, and while the condition is treatable, it is not always curable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the potential clinical applications of biomimetic corpus cavernosum for the treatment of penile injuries," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; Wang and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, this study advances the clinical application of 3D-printed artificial tissue organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

'I looked over, and she was laying on the ground.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As four-year-old Locklynn laid unresponsive on the floor of her Chillicothe home's bathroom, her mother, Haley Dyke, 27, with the help of Brad's sister, performed CPR on the unconscious girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the two women continued to provide life-saving care to little Locklynn, Brad rushed his daughter to a nearby hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon arriving to the hospital, the preschool-aged girl coded and went into cardiac arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A parent's worst fear is hearing a flat line on the hospital's machines,' Locklynn's aunt wrote on GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a couple of minutes - described as a 'lifetime' by her parents - medical staff revived the Locklynn's pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They had to do three rounds of CPR on her before they finally got a pulse,' Brad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A medical crew then flew Locklynn to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus - 50 miles from Chillicothe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, even with the extensive life-saving care she was provided, an MRI revealed that due to the cardiac arrest, which caused her brain to stop receiving oxygen, the little girl obtained 'severe brain damage' that will affect her for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An MRI revealed that due to the cardiac arrest, which caused Locklynn's brain to stop receiving oxygen, she obtained 'severe brain damage' that will affect her for the rest of her life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They came in and told us that she had massive amounts of brain injuries,' the devastated father said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We were told she would never walk again, she would never be able to eat on her own again, never to be able to talk again, never be able to play with her sisters, brother or cousins,' Patrick wrote. 'The Locklynn we once knew is no longer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brad said his daughter spent more than two days in a coma, but she's awake now and off the ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fact that she's alive makes me hopeful, but when I just sit down and think about it, I get angry,' he said. 'But I think that's just one of those emotions I'm still processing through.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Brad sits in the hospital with his little girl, he hopes her situation saves someone else's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used to be that kind of person that was like, 'Oh, it's the flu, you'll be OK,' he said.

			&lt;p&gt;Maybe dogs who chew sticks are on to something. We don't necessarily have to chomp with a canine's zeal, but the basic concept – safely gnawing some hard, durable material – might be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, chewing on a hard substance like wood can boost levels of a naturally occurring antioxidant in the human brain, which in turn might improve a person's memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people chew gum, of course, which is softer but arguably more palatable than wood (and avoids tongue splinters). Previous research has shown chewing gum can, in fact, significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010209000893?via%3Dihub"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910308200817"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, as the authors of the new study note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the brain's blood supply pumping seems to improve a variety of cognitive functions, it seems. Curiously, clinical evidence also suggests people who find chewing a challenge also tend to have lower cognitive function and higher mental impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear, though, what specific metabolic changes associated with cognition might occur following a boost in cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers investigated one possible explanation involving oxidative stress in neurological tissues, which is already believed to play a pivotal role in the decline of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several metabolic processes produce harmful molecules known as reactive oxygen species, which can cause cumulative oxidative damage in the human brain. One of the brain's best defenses against oxidative stress is an antioxidant called glutathione (GSH), which holds many important jobs throughout the body, including protecting neurons from reactive oxygen species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to shed light on the cognitive effects of chewing, the researchers designed the new study to explore the potential role of glutathione. Despite its importance in the brain, they note, the relationship between glutathione levels and mastication has drawn little attention until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruited 52 healthy university students from Daegu, South Korea, and divided them into two groups. One group of 27 subjects was given paraffin wax gum to chew; a second group of 25 was asked to chew on wooden medical tongue depressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg" alt="dog chewing on a stick" class="size-full wp-image-154198" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maybe dogs are onto something. (&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/39908901@N06/6995110133/"&gt;m01229/Flickr/CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects chewed their assigned substance for five minutes, while researchers used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutathione levels in their anterior cingulate cortex – a key brain region for cognitive control – before and after chewing. All subjects also took a cognitive test before and after the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chewing significantly boosted glutathione levels in subjects' anterior cingulate cortices, especially in the wood-chewing group compared with the gum-chewing group, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with results from the cognitive tests, the rise in glutathione concentration correlated positively with memory function. In other words, those who chewed wood and had larger glutathione boosts also performed better on the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that mastication can alter the level of antioxidants in the human brain, and that an increase in brain antioxidant levels is associated with cognitive function," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research will still be needed to back up these findings, the study's authors add, with larger sample sizes, broader demographics, and assessment of different brain regions important focusses for subsequent studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wood seemed to confer more benefit than paraffin wax gum, this study also only tested two substances being chewed for five minutes. Future research might also investigate a wider range of materials and chewing durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings alone may not be sufficient evidence to recommend chewing wood for better memory, but they do provide a compelling hint. And it would be good news if chewing wood does have this effect, the researchers write, given the challenge of managing glutathione levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since there are currently no drugs or established practices for boosting brain GSH levels, our findings suggest that chewing moderately hard material could serve as an effective practice for increasing GSH levels in the brain," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919/full"&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000a2e6cdxrbzlls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000b2e6cl4ok9kif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understanding infectious disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00112e6cim844a5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xna7ln00033b6mbmoemelp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001f2e6c96gesrp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xj0yyx00002e6cb0654evm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpimxw000k3b6mrnzjws7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpi87f00032e6ctsf3lox5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpx3e8000b2e6czy5syvtf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xprk1t00062e6c1xq1cx39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmkc5p002s26pbchgj8qis@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000c2e6cwtm9usqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000a2e6cdxrbzlls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000b2e6cl4ok9kif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understanding infectious disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00112e6cim844a5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xna7ln00033b6mbmoemelp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001f2e6c96gesrp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xj0yyx00002e6cb0654evm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpimxw000k3b6mrnzjws7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpi87f00032e6ctsf3lox5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpx3e8000b2e6czy5syvtf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xprk1t00062e6c1xq1cx39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned. Here’s what to know about the cases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-1d3d1d2b"&gt;Should I be concerned about the local cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Neither of the two patients in New York State, both of whom live in New York City, had been vaccinated against measles — one was an infant and too young to be immunized — and the cases are not related, according to the city’s health department. The first case was reported in January, and the second in February. Both patients have recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s health department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

New Mexico health officials have not linked the outbreak there to the Texas cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The person was the 10th in Lea county to have had a confirmed measles infection. Seven were unvaccinated. The vaccination status of the other three people is unknown. Six of the cases were in adults and the rest were in children younger than 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that they were sending a team to Texas to help local public health officials respond to the outbreak, which began in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles – one of the most infectious diseases in the world – is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases.

Kennedy has long promoted the discredited theory linking childhood vaccinations to autism. One of his first actions in office was to postpone a public meeting on immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy raised alarm among pediatricians, vaccine experts and lawmakers after publishing an opinion piece that&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/rfk-jr-vitamins-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; focused on vitamin A and nutrition&lt;/a&gt; as treatments for measles and did not endorse vaccines. In response to the Texas measles outbreak, Kennedy wrote for Fox News about the benefits of “good nutrition” and vitamin A, but did not explicitly recommend highly effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the CDC, measles is fatal for one to two out of every 1,000 infected children.

But a side effect of this clotting factor is that it triggers a protein called ARHGEF1 — and that protein can suppress the cancer-fighting immune cells known as T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of someone taking aspirin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/alarming-rise-in-breast-cancer-rates-in-women-under-40-11683574" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers Find an 'Alarming' Rise in Breast Cancer Rates in Women Under 40, Especially in These 5 States;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Researchers Find an 'Alarming' Rise in Breast Cancer Rates in Women Under 40, Especially in These 5 States &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stopping the clotting factor, you stop the protein that stops the T-cells — a discovery that the study’s first author, Dr. Jie Yang, Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge, called “a Eureka moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before this, we had not been aware of the implication of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin," Yang said.

All had experienced the problem for more than two years and other treatments, such as smell training and corticosteroids, had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a study aiming to find new ways to resolve the issue, surgeons tried a technique called functional septorhinoplasty (fSRP), which is typically used to correct any deviation of the nasal septum, increasing the size of nasal passageways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This boosts airflow into the olfactory region, at the roof of the nasal cavity, which controls smell. Doctors said the surgery enabled an increased amount of odorants – chemical compounds that have a smell – to reach the roof of the nose, where sense of smell is located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They believe that increasing the delivery of odorants to this area “kickstarts” smell recovery in patients who have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/24/do-me-a-flavour-adjusting-to-life-without-a-sense-of-smell-after-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lost their sense of smell to long Covid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Peter Andrews, a senior consultant surgeon in rhinology and facial plastic surgery who led the research, said surgery increased the airway by about 30%, so airflow also increased by about 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study has shown impressive results – if we apply the principle of increasing the nasal or olfactory airway, we’re getting a reactivation of the sense of smell and then an improvement of the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“With long Covid anosmia you’ve got patients, fundamentally, who can’t smell or smell very poorly, so we need to somehow wake them up. And this operation sort of does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It sort of wakes up the olfactory mucosa and then it builds on it through the increased nasal airway – hitting that area, more odorants hitting that area – and we’re getting this impressive recovery in the majority of the patients. All patients we operated on improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the trial, 12 patients had fSRP and a control group of 13 patients continued with smell training – sniffing the same scents repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All patients who had fSRP reported an improved sense of smell compared with none of the patients in the sniff test group, where 40% actually reported a worsening sense of smell. The results were published in the journal Facial Plastic Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the patients, Penelope Newman, 27, from south London, said her taste and smell had “almost returned to normal” after the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Before I had the surgery on my nose, I had begun to accept that I would probably never be able to smell or taste things the way I used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Since the surgery, I have begun to enjoy food and smells the same way I used to. I can now cook and eat garlic and onions and people can cook for me too. I can go out to eat with my friends and family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQZnBvQ0FPa3BtTjBvOGw2bl9Wc1ZzS0U2YkdYckYyaXVDbW9HdWpCdFdnODVoZ0NFY3ZBZUhQUnJiZ1Q5dDZIYmU3MzU4Qy0weTFBUll0a29sMXEwY1lvVGRpTzhsLXAycHRTQ1ZUWE9xSk14bHJBVm1hZGRvREdNVFgyODIwSlY3UDhEMWVnVWJ3SWcza1FJb0Z5VWRYMTZod3JsMjJjaE5adGdyNkt6TkJjTndxVVhkV0tidHRtZ1ByU1dMbVc0</guid></item><item><title>Cedar: Woman being evicted from supported living home, say parents - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE02SlF0cVpLVllhSlNEZU9OSjM4WUdKT3Nta3cxekdXSVdGWlQxT2I4UnB0NVNyOWx1X0o4c1hpM0JxcXBDUW1xSUdVYi1MMW82eG5ack9va0ppUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1HV1FPOVlNSWlTaVFEdDBzTWdTckp6aWhzWkg1Z09CUGkzTE91TTUzXzNRRGh3NTFQMlpHVDJzSHEza2NFY05OYzdHd0wwb1ZXeWs4NF9XbkRqSm1YTFdz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Woman being 'evicted' from supported living home - parents&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Lyndsey Telford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News NI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC A man and a woman are standing next to each other outside a house.

of vital importance to us and we will continue to work with her family regarding the next steps in finding the best outcome for her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp said their daughter did not have capacity to share her story herself and that they were speaking on her behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They said they were worried about their daughter's wellbeing, particularly given her past experience as a patient of Muckamore Abbey Hospital, which is currently subject to a public inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

deteriorated over the last year and that they had raised multiple concerns with her current care provider, including about her medication, wellbeing and cleanliness of her apartment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There have also been ongoing issues, they said, regarding their request to bring in a private occupational therapist to assist their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp said in response to their concerns, they were accused of being "abusive" to staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In January, they received a letter from Cedar giving eight weeks' notice of its decision to end her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp described this as an "eviction".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Continuous contact'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the letter, Cedar said it would work closely with the Belfast Trust to "minimise disruption" to Ms Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The main reason for the decision, it said, was that it was "unable to provide the care and support that Laura needs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It added that relationships had "broken down" between Mr and Mrs Sharp and Cedar staff, citing "ongoing incidents of verbal aggression, disparaging comments, and intimidation towards staff".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It also said there had been "continuous contact" from the parents with visits, emails, and phone calls which had "led to unrealistic demands and pressures put on the staff and the service".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp acknowledged that they may have been in contact too much – but that they were worried for their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They said they had never been abusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block"

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A disability charity told BBC News NI it had worked with "hundreds of families" in which relationships with providers have "broken down" - and in some cases become "hostile".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Nuala Toman, head of disability and innovation at Disability Action, said: "Across the board, what we see is when a disabled person and a family raise a challenge then the system challenges back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;BBC News NI has spoken to another family with a loved one in a different home in a separate trust, who said they, too, felt they were being punished for making complaints about care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Sharp said: "When you raise concerns, they call that abuse. It's not abuse. We've never been abusive, just questioning them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I have never raised my voice up there, ever, in the seven years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mrs Sharp added: "If we weren't here, they wouldn't be evicting Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's us they really want rid of. And for them to put her out of there, because of concerns we've raised, it's just baffling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the Cedar Foundation said it could not comment on individual cases it said it was "committed to work in partnership with individuals, families, and health trusts to do [its] best to make sure disabled people get the support most appropriate to their needs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Wits' end'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Toman from Disability Action said disabled people and their families "deserve better".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said generally when families' relationships with providers break down, it can be "very, very lonely" for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"And we see the detrimental impact that this hostile reaction can have on disabled people and their families. Because often the disabled person is confused. And then from the family perspective, they're lost, alone, they're anxious, sleep deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Disabled people and families deserve better than facing a personal challenge just because you want right to be done by yourself or your child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This, she added, had left people at "their wits' end" and feeling punished – including the person living in a care setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said that it was important to note, however, that this was not in every case and that the charity dealt with some "really positive" cases in which disabled people and their families were content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Still your child'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Toman added that the role of an advocate was vital for families to communicate with providers on their behalf, to ensure that any issues raised focus on "processes" as opposed to "the person".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But she warned that not all families had access to effective advocates and this was an issue that needed to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Meanwhile, Mrs Sharp said removing her daughter from her home of seven years would "wreck her" and would cause her health to decline rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She added that the couple had not gone out of their way to "look for faults".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"That's just being a parent, looking out for your child," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I know she's 39.

Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation, Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients” in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:says measles vaccination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated] communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Doctor was disciplined over treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disciplinary action;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The board’s final order stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources and medical support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision in 2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he would modify his practice accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his &lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:silver bullet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found that his claims;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;A virus ‘that doesn’t really discriminate’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:state health department;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s] another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the outbreak is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t really discriminate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Vaccines prevent measles, vitamin A doesn’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Others echoed that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Understanding infectious disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Amanda Sealy, Meg Tirrell and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 23:45:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNM0VIbnpDMmVGTnV4UzZLdnBBaGdVMWJlWlNGQ1hQaEJlMXdUYmFLcmc3d3Q1a2FSYVdtM3JuZGZzLUJiZV9QQ1podEZnc3lRa2dLcGw5N2F1aWdySE1RakVPRE43MkdhaGdxRXRaNllCQjU5ZnA1TWV3M1Z4QWlOMjEtNFlvcFdVZ2FKbWZIaEdjZw</guid></item><item><title>What can’t vitamin A do?

While vitamin A is sometimes used to treat measles when someone is already infected, it can’t actually prevent people from getting sick like a vaccine can, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Thomas Russo,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Thomas Russo,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, tells Yahoo Life. But even using vitamin A as a treatment for measles is a bit complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2010 &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/suppl_1/i48/699532?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that there was “no significant reduction” in people dying from measles after taking vitamin A treatments across six randomized controlled trials. But, when the researchers broke things down by dose, they found that having at least two doses of vitamin A lowered the risk of dying from measles by 62%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But here’s some important context: “The major studies that have been done about the benefits of the treatment of measles — particularly severe measles — have been done in the developing world where children are often malnourished and don’t have enough vitamin A to begin with,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. William Schaffner,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. In those cases, certain doses of vitamin A, given as early as possible in infected children, may help lower the risk of measles complications like pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), Schaffner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But that’s in the developing world,” he says.

Worth noting: It’s unlikely that you’d overdose on vitamin A from food alone, notes Russo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bobrick says these are the biggest sources of vitamin A:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oily fish like salmon, cod liver and mackerel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dark, leafy greens like spinach and kale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you’re considering a vitamin A supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vitamin A shows up in some multivitamins, and Kim says those are fine to take.

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing better than watching a slab of fresh butter soften and sizzle as you circle it around the skillet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If just the thought of it makes you jump with ghee, you butter beware — that innocent little rectangle could be melting your chances at longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine linked greater consumption of butter to increased mortality rates, while &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/15/health/plant-based-diets-best-for-lowering-disease-cancer-risk-study/"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; oils offer protective benefits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Replacing butter with plant-based oils can slash your risk of early death by a whopping 17%, a new study shows. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;motortion – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the data of over 200,000 adults and found that replacing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/lifestyle/parenting-experts-warn-against-using-butter-to-lull-restless-babies-to-sleep/"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt; with plant-based oils can slash your risk of premature death by a whopping 17%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies have demonstrated that replacing butter with plant-based oils can yield health benefits, particularly when it comes to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/heart-disease-could-be-prevented-with-this-one-simple-test/"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Schiff, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Health’s &lt;a href="https://huntington.northwell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Huntington Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post why butter is so “bad” for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Butter has been shown to raise LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the body, which can clog your arteries and increase your risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/your-takeout-containers-could-cause-congestive-heart-failure/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” Schiff said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Butter also contains saturated fats, she explained, which are typically solid at room temperature and found in products like butter, coconut oil, lard, cheese and cream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, plant-based oils such as olive and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/health/5-swaps-for-butter-that-can-improve-cholesterol-lower-disease-risks/"&gt;avocado oil&lt;/a&gt; are rich in monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, as well as anti-inflammatory &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/health/fish-oil-supplement-can-add-this-many-years-to-your-life/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; — that’s why Schiff uses them “almost exclusively.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I use olive oil in salad dressing, for sautéing foods and sometimes in baking,” she said. “It’s high in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/health/6-antioxidant-rich-superfoods-can-help-you-live-longer-dietitian/"&gt;plant phenols&lt;/a&gt; — compounds that work as antioxidants and may help prevent cell damage and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added that avocado oil is also a good source of antioxidants, has a neutral taste and can withstand higher cooking temperatures than olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” she advised. ”They’re healthier because they retain more nutrients — vitamins, minerals and antioxidants — than processed and refined oils.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” one nutritionist advised. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dušan Zidar – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/health/are-seed-oils-really-that-bad-for-you-dietitians-explain-the-risk/"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, like cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil and soybean oil, Schiff knows they get a bad rap and have become quite the hot topic on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with seed oils is the high ratio of omega-6 oils to omega-3 oils,” she explained. “A healthy balance of omega-6s to omega-3s (about four-to-one) can help &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body. High levels of omega-6s versus omega-3s can increase inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is that “we tend to get a lot of our seed oil from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and the oils in those foods are often highly refined and processed themselves,” which is why she suggests getting seed oils that are cold-pressed if you want to cook with them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-module__inner"&gt;

					Thanks for signing up!				&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;She believes these oils can still be part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation and balanced with omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you absolutely can’t live without butter, opt for the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/im-a-cancer-survivor-here-are-the-everyday-supplies-ive-cut-from-my-kitchen/"&gt;grass-fed&lt;/a&gt; kind, as it has lower amounts of saturated fats and more healthy fats, as well as more vitamin K2 — which helps boost heart health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like to demonize any food, but I’d recommend grass-fed, pasture-raised butter over conventional butter if you really want to have butter,” Schiff said. “And eat less of it. Lean more towards olive and avocado oil, use unrefined seed oils and avoid ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t forget that “you don’t need to be perfect,” she said, especially since “everyone’s body is different in how it processes fats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of ultra-processed foods on our health has become a topic of increasing concern in recent years. A groundbreaking study conducted by Australian researchers has shed light on the alarming effects of consuming these products daily. The findings, published in the journal Age &amp;amp; Aging in December 2024, reveal that regularly indulging in ultra-processed foods can accelerate biological aging and increase the risk of chronic diseases and mortality.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;The hidden dangers of ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods, such as chips, cookies, candies, and sodas, have long been associated with adverse health effects. However, the extent of their impact on our bodies has remained unclear until now. The recent study, which analyzed data from over 16,000 American adults, has uncovered disturbing links between the consumption of these products and biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1821856092"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biological age, a measure that reflects a person’s overall health status, appears to be significantly affected by the intake of ultra-processed foods. The researchers found that for every 10% increase in the consumption of these products, biological aging accelerated by approximately 2.5 months. This means that individuals who consumed the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods were biologically older by about 10 months compared to those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/05/is-walking-1-mile-per-day-enough-to-reap-health-benefits-experts-weigh-in/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Is walking 1 mile per day enough to reap health benefits? Experts weigh in.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, Dr. Barbara Cardoso, the lead author of the study, provided a striking example: “Adding an extra 200 calories of ultra-processed foods, roughly equivalent to a small chocolate bar, could advance the process of biological aging by more than two months compared to chronological aging.” This revelation highlights the importance of &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/24/this-is-the-best-time-to-have-dinner-for-good-health-and-to-gain-less-weight/"&gt;maintaining a balanced diet and making informed choices about meal timing&lt;/a&gt; to promote overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-1002405031"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Accelerated aging and increased health risks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings extend beyond the acceleration of biological aging. Researchers also observed a correlation between high consumption of ultra-processed foods and increased risks of mortality and chronic diseases. Dr. Cardoso emphasized the significance of these results, stating, “Our predictions show that for every 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption, the risk of mortality rises by nearly 2%, and the risk of chronic disease increases by 0.5%.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics underscore the urgent need to address our reliance on ultra-processed foods. While it may be tempting to reach for convenient, packaged snacks, the long-term consequences on our health can be severe. It’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/13/eating-pasta-boosts-mood-new-scientific-study-reveals/"&gt;some foods, like pasta, have been shown to have positive effects on mood&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the importance of making informed dietary choices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of ultra-processed foods extends beyond aging and mortality risk. Numerous studies have linked these products to a wide range of health issues, including cardiovascular problems, brain and mental health concerns, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. By reducing our intake of these foods, we may be able to mitigate these risks and promote healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/forget-yoga-and-pilates-this-sport-is-even-better-for-keeping-a-slim-waist-after-40/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Forget yoga and Pilates, this sport is even better for keeping a slim waist after 40.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Strategies for healthier eating habits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the compelling evidence against ultra-processed foods, it’s crucial to develop strategies for reducing their consumption and adopting healthier eating habits. Dr. Cardoso suggests that “eating fewer ultra-processed foods can help slow down the trajectory of biological aging, providing an additional reason to target ultra-processed foods when considering strategies to promote healthy aging.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effective approach is to focus on whole, minimally processed foods. Incorporating more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your diet can provide essential nutrients without the harmful additives found in ultra-processed products. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/21/people-who-depend-morning-coffee-often-share-these-7-personality-traits/"&gt;being mindful of habits like excessive coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to overall health improvements.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal planning and preparation can also play a crucial role in reducing reliance on ultra-processed foods. By setting aside time to cook meals from scratch, you have greater control over the ingredients and can avoid the hidden sugars, fats, and additives often present in packaged foods. This approach not only benefits your physical health but can also have positive effects on mental well-being.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Building resilience and making lasting changes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Changing long-established eating habits can be challenging, but it’s essential for long-term health and well-being. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/30/people-who-recover-quickly-failure-tend-display-these-8-traits/"&gt;Developing resilience and the ability to bounce back from setbacks&lt;/a&gt; is crucial when adopting healthier lifestyle choices. It’s important to remember that small, consistent changes can lead to significant improvements over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/how-much-should-you-walk-after-60-to-live-longer-science-reveals-the-key-distance/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;How much should you walk after 60 to live longer? Science reveals the key distance.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One effective strategy is to gradually replace ultra-processed foods with healthier alternatives. For example, swapping chips for nuts or fresh fruit can satisfy cravings while providing better nutritional value. Similarly, replacing sugary sodas with water or unsweetened tea can significantly reduce calorie intake and improve overall health.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educating yourself about nutrition and food labels can also empower you to make informed choices. Learning to identify ultra-processed foods and understanding their potential health impacts can motivate you to seek out healthier options. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/01/doctor-reveals-five-hidden-effects-of-stopping-alcohol-for-30-days-has-on-the-brain/"&gt;considering the effects of other lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, can contribute to a more comprehensive approach to health and aging.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-5"&gt;Fostering a supportive environment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making lasting changes to our eating habits often requires a supportive environment. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/12/if-you-want-deeper-connections-say-goodbye-these-7-habits/"&gt;Cultivating deeper connections with like-minded individuals&lt;/a&gt; can provide encouragement and accountability in your journey towards healthier eating. Sharing meals with friends and family who prioritize whole foods can make the transition more enjoyable and sustainable.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community initiatives, such as farmers’ markets and cooking classes, can also play a role in promoting healthier food choices. These programs not only provide access to fresh, minimally processed foods but also offer opportunities to learn new cooking skills and discover delicious alternatives to ultra-processed products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/03/green-tea-is-good-for-your-health-but-its-not-without-risks-especially-for-these-people/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Green tea is good for your health, but it’s not without risks, especially for these people.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By fostering a culture that values whole foods and mindful eating, we can collectively work towards reducing the prevalence of ultra-processed foods in our diets. This shift not only benefits individual health but also has the potential to positively impact public health on a broader scale, potentially reducing the burden of chronic diseases and promoting healthier aging across populations.

            These findings challenge the growing social media trend that attacks seed oils in favor of butter, ghee and animal fats.

            “Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients we have in foods,” said US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBkBhZPRH6d/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, who continues to promote the slogan “Making Frying Oil Tallow Again.”

            Many other influencers have supported similar claims, including Dr. Paul Saladino, who promotes an animal-based diet and has amassed 2.6 million Instagram followers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0007356mp20ixo40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is a health food with amazing nutrients,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulsaladinomd/reel/Cr6QPD9PWn_/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt;, adding that butter is good for the gut, brain, cardiovascular health, and overall health and vitality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0008356mg7148zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The evidence doesn’t support that view, according to study coauthor Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0009356m4x5tats5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason that is not clear to me, a myth has been floating around the internet that butter is a healthy fat, but there is no good evidence to support this,” said Willett, who has authored over 2,000 articles and numerous books and has spent 40 years studying the impact of diet on the development of major diseases, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000a356m7uk6ei5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Willett and his team’s latest research revealed that higher butter consumption was associated with a 15% higher risk of mortality, whereas higher intake of plant-based oils — including soybean, canola and olive oil — was linked to a 16% reduction in total mortality, according to the study published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

            In addition, substituting just 10 grams (0.35 ounces) of butter with these plant-based oils daily was associated with a 17% lower risk of both total mortality and cancer-related deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000c356m274bxo9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seventeen percent is quite a big change, especially when you look at the public health perspective,” said Dr. Yu Zhang, study coauthor and researcher at the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Imagine how many deaths we can reduce in the general population.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

            The study analyzed 33 years of dietary data from more than 221,000 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000k356mkebc0v24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants self-reported their dietary habits every four years, allowing researchers to track changes over time and calculate long-term intake averages. Researchers adjusted their findings to account for variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total calorie intake, as well as other dietary patterns using the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/evaluating-adherence-to-recommended-diets-in-adults-the-alternate-healthy-eating-index/1163D3C29653628A1209EB88AE166BF1" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000l356mq21xx4jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Butter intake included any amount used in cooking and baking, as well as any extra butter spread on food. Plant-based oil consumption was estimated based on the type of oil used in frying, sautéing, baking or making salad dressings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000m356mbqoxvqnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Emerita at New York University, noted the new study is correlational and shows association, not causation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000n356mg3fy4i7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even so, it’s consistent with decades of evidence linking saturated fat to health risks and demonstrating quite substantial health benefits of substituting plant oils (including seed oils) for animal fats,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000o356m6d545vqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are derived from plant seeds, whereas plant-based oils are extracted from a variety of different plant parts. All oils examined in the study fall under the seed oil category, except for olive oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000p356mq8b1stpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Olive oil, canola oil, and soybean oil were each more consistently associated with benefit: a lower risk of dying,” said cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “These findings add to a large body of scientific literature on the health benefits of these plant oils, whose positive effects have been demonstrated in both large observational studies and dozens of randomized trials.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkpcl000i356mkz8st1d4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study indicates that some plant oils lead to better health outcomes, Zhang clarified that this doesn’t mean butter should be eliminated altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000w356m8u6hel68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are not suggesting that people should avoid butter entirely, but we are recommending that even a small reduction in butter in replacement for plant-based oils in a daily diet could lead to very substantial, long-term health benefits,” Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000x356m3aaqlpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The choice to use butter may depend on available options for the consumer, Willett said. If given the choice between butter and a partially hydrogenated plant oil rich in trans fats, he said, butter might be a better option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000z356mzaex96bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat#:~:text=Final%20Determination%20Regarding%20Partially%20Hydrogenated%20Oils%20(Removing%20Trans%20Fat),-Share&amp;amp;text=In%202015%2C%20FDA%20released%20its,levels%20in%20other%20edible%20oils." target="_blank"&gt;2015 ban&lt;/a&gt; on trans fats passed by the US Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers can still use up to a half of gram of trans fat per serving. That can add up fast in a daily diet, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114#:~:text=Products%20made%20before%20the%20FDA,amount%20is%20below%200.5%20grams." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0010356mcfr8z6l5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, if the decision is between butter and beef tallow — which has been promoted by Kennedy as a healthier substitute for seed oils — canola, soybean and olive oils are the superior choice, Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0011356mo6ehh0v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although beef tallow was not examined in this study, on the basis of its composition we would expect it to be no better than butter,” Willett said, pointing to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5081717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; he authored that found fat from red meat, which is mostly composed of beef fat, was marginally worse than dairy fat in regards to mortality or cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0012356m3cne1pjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is very high in saturated fat, approximately 2/3 of the fat, and it contains almost none of the beneficial, essential polysaturated fats,” Willett said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0013356m48apf9rn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings don’t mean that we should never consume butter, but it is best to use it just when its specific flavor is important, not as a primary source of fat,” he added. “For me, this is the several times a year that I have lobster … butter is absolutely essential!”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhlde3000u356m2zy31gqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re looking to make the switch to plant oils or debating which ones to use, it’s all about finding a balance to include some of the essential nutrients your body needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001a356m7175xqrq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Olive, canola and soybean oils had the most beneficial impact on health outcomes in the study, according to Zhang, which comes from their high levels of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s maintain the body’s cells, provide energy, maintain immune defense and reduce inflammation when it’s at optimal levels (like most things, too much omega-3 &lt;a href="https://news.oregonstate.edu/news/excess-omega-3-fatty-acids-could-lead-negative-health-effects" target="_blank"&gt;may be harmful&lt;/a&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001b356m9h2fmamr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other seed oils such as corn, peanut, safflower and sunflower contain higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids, which are also necessary to maintain good health.&lt;br&gt;Omega-6 molecules stimulate hair and skin growth, regulate metabolism, support bone health, and in some cases, may even have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/fish-oil-heart-wellness/index.html"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xix6es00053b6mvx4hnm61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, omega-6s can also be converted into molecules such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3081099/#:~:text=Prostaglandins%20play%20a%20key%20role,cardinal%20signs%20of%20acute%20inflammation." target="_blank"&gt;prostaglandins&lt;/a&gt; that signal the initiation of inflammation — not a bad thing when your body is trying to quickly repel an invader or tumor, but devastating if left smoldering for long periods without resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001d356mrajvtkds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Americans have an overabundance of omega-6s in their bodies due to their use in ultraprocessed foods and eating at fast food establishments. One omega 6, &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/omega-6-fatty-acids" target="_blank"&gt;linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#reference78" target="_blank"&gt;most common omega-6&lt;/a&gt; in the US food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001c356mrl6nbie5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids; soybean and canola oil have both,” Willett said. “Corn and sunflower oil have very little omega-3 fatty content; these can be part of a mix of different oils, but should not be relied upon as a sole source of plant oil.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001e356m8op9xti9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter which oils you’re using in your diet, it’s best to use them sparingly, Nestle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001f356ma260ua5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m always for varying food intake to the extent possible and that goes for oils, as well,” she said.  “All oils, no matter which, provide about 120 calories per tablespoon so are best used in the proverbial moderation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a century, scientists have analyzed the vast microbial world within the human body. They’ve found bacteria, fungi, and viruses that influence our health in many ways. We thought we had a decent idea of what lies in our bodies. But nature, as it so often does, seems to have thrown us a curveball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidden within the microbial communities of our gut and mouth, researchers have identified thousands of tiny, virus-like genetic entities. They’re not viruses, not bacteria, and they don’t look like anything we’ve seen before. They call them obelisks — flattened, rod-shaped loops of RNA that challenge fundamental assumptions about what constitutes life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have likened it to “fossils from another world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-obelisks"&gt;What Are Obelisks?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery of obelisks came from a deep dive into genetic databases. Led by Ivan Zheludev and Andrew Fire at Stanford University, a team of scientists analyzed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38293115/"&gt;massive metatranscriptomic datasets&lt;/a&gt; — collections of RNA sequences extracted from human stool and saliva samples. What they found was astonishing: nearly 30,000 distinct sequences forming RNA circles that were unlike anything in recorded biology. They’re so unusual we wouldn’t even know where to put them on the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make things even stranger, they seem to be remarkably common. These structures have been detected in approximately 7% of gut bacteria and 50% of oral bacteria samples worldwide, suggesting a widespread presence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obelisks sort of look like viruses but unlike viruses, they don’t have an outer protein coat. Their structure is reminiscent of viroids — plant pathogens composed of simple RNA loops that also don’t have a protein coat. But obelisks are not found in plants. Instead, they inhabit bacterial species, including &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus sanguinis&lt;/em&gt;, a common microbe in human mouths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear what they actually do. They don’t seem to be pathogens, so they may just be benign passengers, quietly existing within bacteria without altering their hosts. Alternatively, they could play an active role in microbial genetics, potentially influencing bacterial behavior or even interacting with human cells. They could have significant impacts for digestion, immunity, or even diseases; but we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;So… what do we know about them?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified unique proteins, tentatively named &lt;em&gt;oblins&lt;/em&gt;, encoded by obelisk genomes. Unlike traditional viroids, which do not encode proteins, these RNA loops seem capable of producing molecules that might interact with bacterial or even human cells. It’s hard to say what this actually means, but the fact that these proteins do exists suggests that obelisks are either something between a viroid and a virus or something entirely new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s insane,” says Mark Peifer, a cell and developmental biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/it-s-insane-new-viruslike-entities-found-human-gut-microbes"&gt;for Science&lt;/a&gt;. “The more we look, the more crazy things we see.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They could be evolutionary relics — remnants of an ancient stage in the development of life. They could even be a missing link in the evolutionary history of viruses, suggesting that viral genomes may have once been simple RNA circles like these before evolving into more complex infectious agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We don’t even know if these obelisks are alive. In fact, scientists have been debating whether viruses are alive for decades (because they can’t replicate independent of a host cell’s molecules). Obelisks seem to be even simpler “creatures” and they could end up forcing us to reconsider what we even consider to be “alive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite their mysterious nature, obelisks could have practical implications for medicine and microbiome research. If they play a role in regulating bacterial populations, they might influence conditions linked to the gut microbiome, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, or even mental health disorders. Future research will need to explore whether obelisks interact with human health in ways that warrant medical attention — or if they are merely another hidden feature of the vast microbial world inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike previous BCIs, which lasted only a few days, this AI-enhanced device worked reliably for seven months. The AI model adapts to natural shifts in brain activity, maintaining accuracy over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training with a virtual arm, the participant successfully grasped, moved, and manipulated real-world objects. The technology represents a major step toward restoring movement for people with paralysis. Researchers are now refining the system for smoother operation and testing its use in home settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Stability:&lt;/strong&gt; The AI-enhanced BCI functioned for seven months, far longer than previous versions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The system adjusts to daily shifts in brain activity, maintaining accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Use:&lt;/strong&gt; The participant controlled a robotic arm to pick up objects and use a water dispenser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at UC San Francisco have enabled a man who is paralyzed to control a robotic arm through a device that relays signals from his brain to a computer.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was able to grasp, move and drop objects just by imagining himself performing the actions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device, known as a brain-computer interface (BCI), worked for a record 7 months without needing to be adjusted. Until now, such devices have only worked for a day or two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and a robotic hand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BCI relies on an AI model that can adjust to the small changes that take place in the brain as a person repeats a movement – or in this case, an imagined movement – and learns to do it in a more refined way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blending of learning between humans and AI is the next phase for these brain-computer interfaces,” said neurologist, Karunesh Ganguly, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. “It’s what we need to achieve sophisticated, lifelike function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears March 6 in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key was the discovery of how activity shifts in the brain day to day as a study participant repeatedly imagined making specific movements. Once the AI was programmed to account for those shifts, it worked for months at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, location, location &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly studied how patterns of brain activity in animals represent specific movements and saw that these representations changed day-to-day as the animal learned. He suspected the same thing was happening in humans, and that was why their BCIs so quickly lost the ability to recognize these patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly and neurology researcher Nikhilesh Natraj, PhD, worked with a study participant who had been paralyzed by a stroke years earlier. He could not speak or move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had tiny sensors implanted on the surface of his brain that could pick up brain activity when he imagined moving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether his brain patterns changed over time, Ganguly asked the participant to imagine moving different parts of his body, like his hands, feet or head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he couldn’t actually move, the participant’s brain could still produce the signals for a movement when he imagined himself doing it. The BCI recorded the brain’s representations of these movements through the sensors on his brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly’s team found that the shape of representations in the brain stayed the same, but their locations shifted slightly from day to day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From virtual to reality &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly then asked the participant to imagine himself making simple movements with his fingers, hands or thumbs over the course of two weeks, while the sensors recorded his brain activity to train the AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the participant tried to control a robotic arm and hand. But the movements still weren’t very precise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Ganguly had the participant practice on a virtual robot arm that gave him feedback on the accuracy of his visualizations. Eventually, he got the virtual arm to do what he wanted it to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the participant began practicing with the real robot arm, it only took a few practice sessions for him to transfer his skills to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could make the robotic arm pick up blocks, turn them and move them to new locations. He was even able to open a cabinet, take out a cup and hold it up to a water dispenser.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, the participant was still able to control the robotic arm after a 15-minute “tune-up” to adjust for how his movement representations had drifted since he had begun using the device.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with paralysis, the ability to feed themselves or get a drink of water would be life changing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly thinks this is within reach.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very confident that we’ve learned how to build the system now, and that we can make this work,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other authors of this study include Sarah Seko and Adelyn Tu-Chan of UCSF and Reza Abiri of the University of Rhode Island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (1 DP2 HD087955) and the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and robotics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#65170a070c0b4b0804170e1625100616034b000110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robin Marks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robin Marks – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/a&gt;” by Karunesh Ganguly et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system needs to balance the stability of neural representations with plasticity. It is unclear what the representational stability of simple well-rehearsed actions is, particularly in humans, and their adaptability to new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electrocorticography brain-computer interface (BCI) in tetraplegic participants, we found that the low-dimensional manifold and relative representational distances for a repertoire of simple imagined movements were remarkably stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manifold’s absolute location, however, demonstrated constrained day-to-day drift. Strikingly, neural statistics, especially variance, could be flexibly regulated to increase representational distances during BCI control without somatotopic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discernability strengthened with practice and was BCI-specific, demonstrating contextual specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling representational plasticity and drift across days subsequently uncovered a meta-representational structure with generalizable decision boundaries for the repertoire; this allowed long-term neuroprosthetic control of a robotic arm and hand for reaching and grasping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study offers insights into mesoscale representational statistics that also enable long-term complex neuroprosthetic control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:55:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE0yOXBTR09fTHo5Zm10c2F6SVFQSDlYNHBMTVpiQXNjcVp6RmZGZUFsQWNtUzZtNVM5YldnUVJpaVluUnJzTGViWmdEN19NckhFNTZ1R0N5cDF0RmNienB4Qm1PQ3JxVDFxRGQxdzlKMA</guid></item><item><title>The Real-Life Diet of a Harvard and MIT Scientist Who Says the Right Diet Can Make You Smarter - GQ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1iUjdCY09BVTRtTng0VV9NYWU4U3lkd1Y2cko4ZFA4RWt3LTIxMHZadWZJWDQ5RnFJeElSLUZBYVVjVm1ILWdJZG0yQ2pOQTFDM2FTNk56dHBsTDI3M2RXeF9LLVo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in nuts and seeds and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7596305/"&gt;are essential for brain development&lt;/a&gt; and health, must be consumed in balance with Omega-3s to support overall well-being. Excessive consumption of Omega-6 fatty acids relative to Omega-3s has been associated with inflammation and various health issues, so balance is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-9 fatty acids—which you can find in olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds—though not essential&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054628/"&gt;, can contribute to cognitive function and cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; when included in a diet rich in diverse fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;What other foods top the list of being “the best” for brain health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods loaded with antioxidants&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/foods-linked-to-better-brainpower"&gt;, including berries and leafy green vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, safeguard the brain against oxidative stress, thereby improving brain efficiency and promoting healthy aging. Additionally, whole grains and vitamin E-rich foods, such as nuts and seeds, are important for vascular health, which is essential for optimal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Are there specific foods that can help people improve specific brain functions, like concentration and memory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain foods have a significant effect on memory and concentration, primarily due to their rich nutrient profiles. Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins found in foods like fatty fish, berries, and leafy greens aid in boosting brain function, enhancing memory, and staving off cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;I’m afraid to ask… but what’s the deal with coffee?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that enhance focus, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/coffee-obsession"&gt;such as those with caffeine and L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;—which are present in coffee and green tea—enhance alertness and attention by influencing neurotransmitter dynamics. I usually only drink coffee once or twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;This is terrible, but not unexpected, news. What’s the alternative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for green tea as an alternative to coffee is generally a good idea. Green tea is rich in caffeine, known to boost alertness and concentration, and also contains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/theanine#:~:text=Oral%20supplementation%20with%2050%E2%80%93200,serotonin%2C%20dopamine%20and%20other%20neurotransmitters."&gt;L-theanine, which supports a state of calm alertness&lt;/a&gt;, possibly enhancing focus while reducing feelings of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;What else do you avoid in your diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I minimize sugar intake—although I do enjoy a piece of chocolate a couple of times a week—and I only eat red meat once or twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Do…I need to do that too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support brain health, it's advisable to limit intake of processed and high-sugar foods (like sugary beverages, candy, cupcakes—all things we stuff ourselves with as children and habituate as comfort foods!), as they can impair cognitive function and memory. Consumption of alcohol and red meats has also been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071474/"&gt;linked to negative impacts on brain health&lt;/a&gt;. Foods high in saturated and trans fats should also be minimized, as they can lead to decreased brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat make a difference in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a profound link between your dietary habits and your brain's health. The science is really just in its infancy for this—and there appears to be a “no one-case fits all”—so people need to experiment to find what works best for them. Having said this, patterns are emerging. Consuming meals at regular, consistent times helps regulate the body's internal clock, stabilizing blood sugar levels and ensuring a steady supply of energy to the brain, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive functions and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;So, where does intermittent fasting come into play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting, which involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, has been shown to benefit brain health. This practice may enhance brain function by reducing oxidative stress, improving brain cell growth, and decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the optimal intervals for eating can vary depending on individual health conditions, lifestyle, and dietary needs. Generally, fasting for 14 or more hours a day is recommended (so, for example, finish dinner by 6 p.m. and have breakfast at 8 a.m.), but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best eating schedule for your specific health goals and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Any other secrets we need to know about how to hack our diets to get smarter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with adaptogens—which are natural substances that typically come from an herb, root, or mushroom.

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrey Popov/iStock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Ngashi Ngongo, MD, PhD, MPH, who leads Africa CDC's mpox incident management team, said, &lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;It&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s a good testimony of the high acceptance.” He added that the DRC&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s health ministry has two strategies in Kinshasa, one targeting entire populations in hot spots, and one targeting contacts of confirmed cases in other locations. The campaign includes children as young as 1-year old, and the vaccination rate has already reached 51.6% of the initial target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More transmissible clade 1b variant detected in Kinshasa&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In a worrying development, Ngongo said the recently identified clade 1a virus that has the APOBEC3 mutation, linked to more transmissibility, has been reported from Kinshasa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Last week, Africa CDC officials described the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/who-extends-mpox-emergency-more-transmissible-clade-1a-variant-identified-dr-congo"&gt;&lt;span&gt;emergence of the new clade 1a variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The APOBEC3 mutation had been found in the newer clade 1b virus, a change thought to contribute to its heightened transmissibility. The older clade 1a virus is thought to be more deadly and more able to cause severe disease, and officials said a more transmissible form of clade 1a raises significant public health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Overall cases in the region have gradually trended downward over the last 5 weeks, but officials have said the trend should be interpreted with caution, due to decreased and slowed testing in the eastern part of the DRC where violence is flaring, slowing testing and impacting the medical care of mpox patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;African countries have reported 24,272 cases this year from 15 nations, and 260 people have died from their infections. Ngongo said Angola reported its first two confirmed cases from two different provinces after 8 weeks with no cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Ngongo said the violence in the mpox hot spot forced 605 mpox patients to flee health centers, and so far 150 people with severe infections have returned to continue their care. More than 2 million people have been displaced internally or across borders due to the violence in the eastern part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In a positive development, scaled up infection prevention and control activities consisting of training and supply procurement in the DRC has seen a 50% reduction in mpox infections in health workers, he said. In October 2023, 104 health worker infections were reported, which dropped to 52 in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of avian flu at two animal slaughter markets in Queens has renewed urgent calls to shut down New York City’s densely packed wet markets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreaks come just weeks after a temporary closure in February, when an undercover investigation by &lt;a href="https://nyclass.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NYCLASS&lt;/a&gt; and Council Member Robert Holden revealed squalid conditions at live animal markets in Queens and Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGYXSW_JoV9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;disturbing footage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was captured after the markets were temporarily closed for five days in February due to a previous avian flu outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-d4473" class="emp-ad-article-leaderboard"&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I see a lot of sickly looking birds. They’re stuffed into cages and are literally on top of each other,” remarked Holden, who represents the District 30 neighborhoods of &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/ridgewood/"&gt;Ridgewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/maspeth/"&gt;Maspeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/middle-village/"&gt;Middle Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/glendale/"&gt;Glendale,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/elmhurst/"&gt;Elmhurst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/rego-park/"&gt;Rego Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-J2ZCYteD" data-type="float"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_512999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512999" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512999" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?w=361" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg 828w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=361,700 361w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=768,1491 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=618,1200 618w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=791,1536 791w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=198,384 198w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=464,900 464w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=824,1600 824w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512999" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Birds were showing dripping blood in the harrowing footage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;via Instagram @nyclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The outbreaks have sparked further alarm among animal rights activists, public health officials, and concerned citizens, who argue that such markets are unsafe to operate amid a bird flu crisis. Advocates have called for immediate and indefinite closure of these markets until proper control measures are in place to address both animal welfare and public health concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-ed36b" class="amp-action"&gt;    
                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYCLASS Executive Director Edita Birnkrant has been vocal in her criticism of the state’s response, accusing Gov. Kathy Hochul of failing to take adequate action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant emphasized that these latest outbreaks should serve as a clear indication that operating these markets during a bird flu outbreak is reckless and puts public health at risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She called on Governor Hochul to shut down the markets indefinitely, pointing out that allowing them to remain open amidst the ongoing crisis contributes to the spread of avian flu and other infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the major concerns raised by advocates is the lack of transparency regarding which markets were affected by the avian flu outbreaks. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials have not disclosed which specific slaughter markets had confirmed cases, leaving the public in the dark about potential exposure. Without this information, consumers are left uncertain whether the poultry they purchase could be infected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512998" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?w=363" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg 828w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=363,700 363w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=768,1482 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=622,1200 622w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=796,1536 796w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=199,384 199w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=466,900 466w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Birds with open wounds were still stuffed in overcrowded cages in this wet market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;via Instagram @nyclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant argued that this lack of accountability is unacceptable and amounts to malpractice on the part of health agencies and government officials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the avian flu outbreaks, NYCLASS has documented troubling conditions at live markets in Queens and Brooklyn. The organization has reported overcrowded cages containing sick and injured birds, many showing signs of infection, including necrotic wounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Often overcrowded and unsanitary, these markets have long been a source of concern for animal rights groups. Birds at these markets are typically kept in appalling conditions, leading to a variety of health issues, including infections and injuries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advocates argue that these markets not only endanger the animals but also create an environment where zoonotic diseases, like avian flu, can easily spread.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The situation is further compounded by reports of hazardous conditions on public streets near the markets. NYCLASS captured footage of an open dumpster dripping with blood and filled with bags of rotting chickens, many of which were torn open with feathers scattered about. The lack of sanitation and safety protocols for both the animals and the public is a major point of concern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People shopping at these markets are exposed to close contact with sick animals without any personal protective equipment (PPE) or safety measures. According to experts, this creates an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, including avian flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Veterinarians and public health experts have also weighed in on the risks posed by these markets. Dr. Crystal Heath, a veterinarian, pointed out that live markets, which allow for direct interaction between the public and stressed animals, are breeding grounds for disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With thousands of people coming into close contact with sick or stressed animals, the conditions are ripe for an influenza virus to jump to humans. The close quarters, lack of sanitation, and high-stress levels among the animals significantly increase the likelihood of disease transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512991" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg 1024w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=700,468 700w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=384,257 384w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=900,602 900w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Markets were temporarily shut down in New York in February due to bird flu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol /Anadolu via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, Dr. Heath noted that such environments increase the risk of avian flu reassorting with the seasonal flu, potentially creating a virus with pandemic potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health risks extend beyond avian flu, as animals in these markets are often exposed to various bacterial infections, respiratory diseases, and other health issues due to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal rights organizations like Woodstock Farm Sanctuary have also expressed concern, sharing their experiences with animals rescued from these markets. The sanctuary has taken in numerous animals directly sourced from New York City’s live markets. Upon examination, many of them have shown signs of infections, neglect, and untreated health issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the animals rescued were so severely compromised that they passed away shortly after their rescue. The conditions these animals endure, both in the markets and in transport, are a major concern for organizations advocating for animal welfare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the lack of testing and oversight on factory farms, where many of the birds sold in these markets are sourced. Critics have pointed out that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/news/new-york-state-announces-further-proactive-measures-prevent-avian-influenza-live-bird-markets#:~:text=New%20York%20State%20Agriculture%20Commissioner,York's%20poultry%20as%20well%20as" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;testing a small sample of birds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from massive factory farms and declaring them free of avian influenza is insufficient and irresponsible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The overcrowded conditions at these farms not only contribute to the spread of avian flu but also result in a host of other health problems for the birds. Animal rights activists argue that the lack of proper regulation and oversight at both factory farms and live slaughter markets is contributing to the ongoing crisis and putting both animal and public health in jeopardy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In light of the continuing outbreaks and the evidence of hazardous conditions, calls for the permanent closure of these markets have grown louder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Di Leonardo, President of &lt;a href="https://www.humanelongisland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Humane Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, warns that failure to take immediate action could lead to the spread of diseases with far-reaching consequences for public health. Just as COVID-19 originated in live markets, avian flu presents a much greater risk, with the potential for devastating consequences if the virus were to mutate or spread further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there are currently no human cases of avian flu, and the threat to the public is still low.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Following continued proactive surveillance of NYC’s live bird markets, Department inspectors detected HPAI in two live bird markets in Queens. Results were later confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL),” the Department of Agriculture and Market stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Both markets immediately closed and completed depopulation, cleaning, and disinfection and will now remain closed for a period of five days. They will be allowed to reopen following an additional inspection. In order to protect impacted businesses and farms, the Department releases county-level information regarding HPAI detections and not the names of the businesses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal welfare groups, health professionals, and concerned citizens continue to urge Gov. Hochul and city officials to act swiftly to close these markets and implement stricter regulations to ensure the safety of both the animals and the public. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers compared young and old rats fed a diet with 60% of calories from fat and found that only the older rats showed cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While metabolic and gut health changes took months to appear, memory deficits emerged quickly in the aged brains. The findings suggest that diet-related brain inflammation is not solely driven by obesity but occurs rapidly with unhealthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just three days of a high-fat diet caused memory impairment in older rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain inflammation occurred before metabolic and gut health changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Young rats on the same diet did not experience cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Just a few days of eating a diet high in saturated fat could be enough to cause memory problems and related brain inflammation in older adults, a new study in rats suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers fed separate groups of young and old rats the high-fat diet for three days or for three months to compare how quickly changes happen in the brain versus the rest of the body when eating an unhealthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108071"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains and fast food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Young rats’ memory and behavior and brain tissue remained unaffected by the fatty food. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected based on previous diabetes and obesity research, eating fatty foods for three months led to metabolic problems, gut inflammation and dramatic shifts in gut bacteria in all rats compared to those that ate normal chow, while just three days of high fat caused no major metabolic or gut changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to changes in the brain, however, researchers found that only older rats – whether they were on the high-fat diet for three months or only three days – performed poorly on memory tests and showed negative inflammatory changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results dispel the idea that diet-related inflammation in the aging brain is driven by obesity, said senior study author Ruth Barrientos, an investigator in the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at The Ohio State University. Most research on the effects of fatty and processed foods on the brain has focused on obesity, yet the impact of unhealthy eating, independent of obesity, remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unhealthy diets and obesity are linked, but they are not inseparable. We’re really looking for the effects of the diet directly on the brain. And we showed that within three days, long before obesity sets in, tremendous neuroinflammatory shifts are occurring,” said Barrientos, also an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health and neuroscience in Ohio State’s College of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in the body in all animals are happening more slowly and aren’t actually necessary to cause the memory impairments and changes in the brain. We never would have known that brain inflammation is the primary cause of high-fat diet-induced memory impairments without comparing the two timelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Immunity &amp;amp; Ageing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of research in Barrientos’ lab has suggested that aging brings on long-term “priming” of the brain’s inflammatory profile coupled with a loss of brain-cell reserve to bounce back, and that an unhealthy diet can make matters worse for the brain in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat constitutes 60% of calories in the high-fat diet used in the study, which could equate to a range of common fast-food options: For example, nutrition data shows that fat makes up about 60% of calories in a McDonald’s double smoky BLT quarter pounder with cheese or a Burger King double whopper with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the animals were on high-fat diets for three days or three months, researchers ran tests assessing two types of memory problems common in older people with dementia that are based in separate regions of the brain: contextual memory mediated by the hippocampus (the primary memory center of the brain), and cued-fear memory that originates in the amygdala (the fear and danger center of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to control animals eating chow and young rats on the high-fat diet, aged rats showed behaviors indicating both types of memory were impaired after only three days of fatty food – and the behaviors persisted as they continued on the high-fat diet for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw changes in levels of a range of proteins called cytokines in the brains of aged rats after three days of fatty food, which signaled a dysregulated inflammatory response. Three months after being on the high-fat diet, some of the cytokine levels had shifted but remained dysregulated, and the cognitive problems persisted in behavior tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A departure from baseline inflammatory markers is a negative response and has been shown to impair learning and memory functions,” Barrientos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to rats eating normal chow, young and old animals gained more weight and showed signs of metabolic dysfunction – poor insulin and blood sugar control, inflammatory proteins in fat (adipose) tissue, and gut microbiome alterations – after three months on the high-fat diet. Young rats’ memory and behavior and brain tissue remained unaffected by the fatty food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These diets lead to obesity-related changes in both young and old animals, yet young animals appear more resilient to the high-fat diet’s effects on memory. We think it is likely due to their ability to activate compensatory anti-inflammatory responses, which the aged animals lack,” Barrientos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, with glucose, insulin and adipose inflammation all increased in both young and old animals, there’s no way to distinguish what is causing memory impairment in only old animals if you look only at what’s happening in the body. It’s what is happening in the brain that’s important for the memory response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Michael Butler, Stephanie Muscat, Brigitte González Olmo, Sabrina Mackey-Alfonso, Nashali Massa, Bryan Alvarez, Jade Blackwell, Menaz Bettes and James DeMarsh of Ohio State; and Maria Elisa Caetano-Silva, Akriti Shrestha, Robert McCusker and Jacob Allen of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3556545951425059591b040004755a46401b505140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Caldwell – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12979-024-00496-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obesity-associated memory impairment and neuroinflammation precede widespread peripheral perturbations in aged rats&lt;/a&gt;” by Ruth Barrientos et al. &lt;em&gt;Immunity &amp;amp; Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity-associated memory impairment and neuroinflammation precede widespread peripheral perturbations in aged rats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity and metabolic syndrome are major public health concerns linked to cognitive decline with aging. Prior work from our lab has demonstrated that short-term high fat diet (HFD) rapidly impairs memory function via a neuroinflammatory mechanism. However, the degree to which these rapid inflammatory changes are unique to the brain is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, deviations in gut microbiome composition have been associated with obesity and cognitive impairment, but how diet and aging interact to impact the gut microbiome, or how rapidly these changes occur, is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, our study investigated the impact of HFD after two distinct consumption durations: 3 months (to model diet-induced obesity) or 3 days (to detect the rapid changes occurring with HFD) on memory function, anxiety-like behavior, central and peripheral inflammation, and gut microbiome profile in young and aged rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that both short-term and long-term HFD consumption impaired memory function and increased anxiety-like behavior in aged, but not young adult, rats. These behavioral changes were accompanied by pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation in the hippocampus and amygdala of aged HFD-fed rats at both time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, changes to fasting glucose, insulin, and inflammation in peripheral tissues such as the distal colon and visceral adipose tissue were increased in young and aged rats only after long-term, but not short-term, HFD consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while subtle HFD-induced changes to the gut microbiome did occur rapidly, robust age-specific effects were only present following long-term HFD consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these data suggest that HFD-evoked neuroinflammation, memory impairment, and anxiety-like behavior in aging develop quicker than, and separately from the peripheral hallmarks of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:20:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBFWDhIVFFqSWJPQWlla2FKLTBHOFAzR1hHaHp2cnFCVzU1Z1d2MVN6bGxCZUJIZkpaRWZhZENkdENTcTZlcmdGVXc4RGZ6b2xFcUFtTjNucndKVDR0WlJPMnNGY3FPcld5M1hQN0xhOA</guid></item><item><title>Large Study of Dietary Habits Suggests More Plant Oils, Less Butter Could Lead to Better Health - Mass General Brigham</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMFZkYXVLT1VqY2hPUHd0SF9Jc0JycFVNQ19PQUh5TFFVYVl0VEtJVzk5cG01RlpvV25hOTNnN2JZOTZ3dVBZUEdyR3d4bkNuZ05fOFBrbTJPUl9Rc2stTWNjZEhGdkppSzlUZ2FNMElydmtfbTRyNHgtY0FhZi1KUHc0bEZBV0QyS3F4UF9aNlB1Q3ZFalp0QjN4S2tDWVM4dUd2T3VBQlVkSnZXNG9lZ1B3VkNuLVhPQ1ZkQUdrQjczZ1BYUjFHT2lzdm1aZFhRTGh3S2pJNlhOcWM3YVMzdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cmp-data-layer="{&amp;quot;text-3eff096f96&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;@type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;aem-mgb/components/text&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;repo:modifyDate&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;2025-03-05T16:45:05Z&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;xdm:text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People who consume plant-based oil instead of butter may experience beneficial health effects and even have a lower risk of premature death, according to a new study by investigators from &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;/content/mgb-global/global/en.html\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Mass General Brigham&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The researchers examined diet and health data from 200,000 people followed for more than 30 years and found that higher intake of plant-based oils, especially soybean, canola, and olive oil, was associated with lower total, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality, whereas butter intake was associated with increased risk of total and cancer mortality. The results are published in &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0205?guestAccessKey=29d87feb-9f96-4666-b23b-8a9487d0207d&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;amp;utm_term\&amp;quot; target=\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and presented simultaneously at the American Heart Association EPI/Lifestyle Scientific Sessions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;What's surprising is the magnitude of the association that we found — we saw a 17% lower risk of death when we modeled swapping butter with plant-based oils in daily diet. That is a pretty huge effect on health,&amp;amp;quot; said study lead author Yu Zhang, MBBS, research assistant at the &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;https://cdnm.bwh.harvard.edu/\&amp;quot; target=\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Channing Division of Network Medicine&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; at &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;https://www.brighamandwomens.org/\&amp;quot; target=\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Brigham and Women's Hospital&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. Zhang is also a student in the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard Chan School.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A key difference between butter and oil is the types of fatty acids contained in them. Butter is rich in saturated fatty acids, while plant-based oils have more unsaturated fatty acids. While there have been many studies on dietary fatty acids, fewer studies have focused on their primary food sources, including butter and oils. Many previous studies have looked at a person's diet at a point in time and have been done in a small population, limiting their applicability to public health.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new study analyzed dietary data from 221,054 participants in the &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;https://nurseshealthstudy.org/\&amp;quot; target=\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Nurses' Health Study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), and &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/health-professionals/\&amp;quot; target=\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Health Professionals Follow-up Study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (HPFS). Every four years, they answered questions about how often they consumed certain types of food. The researchers used the data to estimate how much butter and plant oils they ate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Total butter intake included butter from butter and margarine blend, spreadable butter added to food and bread, and butter used in baking and frying at home. The intake of plant-based oils was estimated based on the reported use in frying, sautéing, baking, and salad dressing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The researchers also identified participants who had died and their causes of death. Using statistics to compare death rates across different diet intake levels, the researchers found that participants who ate the most butter had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who ate the least. In contrast, those who ate the most plant-based oils had a 16% lower risk of death than those who ate the least.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;People might want to consider that a simple dietary swap — replacing butter with soybean or olive oil — can lead to significant long-term health benefits,&amp;amp;quot; said corresponding author &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;quot;https://cdnm.bwh.harvard.edu/daniel-wang-md-scd/\&amp;quot; target=\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Daniel Wang, MD, ScD,&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Wang is also an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard Chan School and an associate member at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. &amp;amp;quot;From a public health perspective, this is a substantial number of deaths from cancer or from other chronic diseases that could be prevented.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The researchers also did a substitution analysis, which mimics how swapping butter for plant oils would impact health in a feeding trial. They found that substituting 10 grams of butter a day (less than a tablespoon) with equivalent calories of plant-based oils could lower cancer deaths and overall mortality by 17%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Even cutting back butter a little and incorporating more plant-based oils into your daily diet can have meaningful long-term health benefits,&amp;amp;quot; Wang said.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One limitation of the study is that the participants are mainly health professionals, so they might not represent the U.S. population as a whole, the researchers said. In the future, they'd like to study the biological mechanisms underlying why this dietary change has such a large impact.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;quot;}}" id="text-3eff096f96" class="cmp-text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed dietary data from 221,054 participants in the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Nurses' Health Study&lt;/a&gt; (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/health-professionals/" target="_blank"&gt;Health Professionals Follow-up Study&lt;/a&gt; (HPFS). Every four years, they answered questions about how often they consumed certain types of food. The researchers used the data to estimate how much butter and plant oils they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total butter intake included butter from butter and margarine blend, spreadable butter added to food and bread, and butter used in baking and frying at home. The intake of plant-based oils was estimated based on the reported use in frying, sautéing, baking, and salad dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified participants who had died and their causes of death. Using statistics to compare death rates across different diet intake levels, the researchers found that participants who ate the most butter had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who ate the least. In contrast, those who ate the most plant-based oils had a 16% lower risk of death than those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People might want to consider that a simple dietary swap — replacing butter with soybean or olive oil — can lead to significant long-term health benefits," said corresponding author &lt;a href="https://cdnm.bwh.harvard.edu/daniel-wang-md-scd/" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Wang, MD, ScD,&lt;/a&gt; of the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Wang is also an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard Chan School and an associate member at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. "From a public health perspective, this is a substantial number of deaths from cancer or from other chronic diseases that could be prevented."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also did a substitution analysis, which mimics how swapping butter for plant oils would impact health in a feeding trial. They found that substituting 10 grams of butter a day (less than a tablespoon) with equivalent calories of plant-based oils could lower cancer deaths and overall mortality by 17%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even cutting back butter a little and incorporating more plant-based oils into your daily diet can have meaningful long-term health benefits," Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the study is that the participants are mainly health professionals, so they might not represent the U.S. population as a whole, the researchers said. In the future, they'd like to study the biological mechanisms underlying why this dietary change has such a large impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

            Swapping your daily butter intake for certain plant-based oils may help reduce your risk of death, a new study finds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjev90004356m0egwvwuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings challenge the growing social media trend that attacks seed oils in favor of butter, ghee and animal fats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0005356m42wka6r9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients we have in foods,” said US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBkBhZPRH6d/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, who continues to promote the slogan “Making Frying Oil Tallow Again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0006356mewioqm1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many other influencers have supported similar claims, including Dr. Paul Saladino, who promotes an animal-based diet and has amassed 2.6 million Instagram followers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0007356mp20ixo40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is a health food with amazing nutrients,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulsaladinomd/reel/Cr6QPD9PWn_/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt;, adding that butter is good for the gut, brain, cardiovascular health, and overall health and vitality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0008356mg7148zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The evidence doesn’t support that view, according to study coauthor Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0009356m4x5tats5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason that is not clear to me, a myth has been floating around the internet that butter is a healthy fat, but there is no good evidence to support this,” said Willett, who has authored over 2,000 articles and numerous books and has spent 40 years studying the impact of diet on the development of major diseases, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000a356m7uk6ei5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Willett and his team’s latest research revealed that higher butter consumption was associated with a 15% higher risk of mortality, whereas higher intake of plant-based oils — including soybean, canola and olive oil — was linked to a 16% reduction in total mortality, according to the study published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition, substituting just 10 grams (0.35 ounces) of butter with these plant-based oils daily was associated with a 17% lower risk of both total mortality and cancer-related deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000c356m274bxo9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seventeen percent is quite a big change, especially when you look at the public health perspective,” said Dr. Yu Zhang, study coauthor and researcher at the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Imagine how many deaths we can reduce in the general population.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study analyzed 33 years of dietary data from more than 221,000 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000k356mkebc0v24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants self-reported their dietary habits every four years, allowing researchers to track changes over time and calculate long-term intake averages. Researchers adjusted their findings to account for variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total calorie intake, as well as other dietary patterns using the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/evaluating-adherence-to-recommended-diets-in-adults-the-alternate-healthy-eating-index/1163D3C29653628A1209EB88AE166BF1" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000l356mq21xx4jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Butter intake included any amount used in cooking and baking, as well as any extra butter spread on food. Plant-based oil consumption was estimated based on the type of oil used in frying, sautéing, baking or making salad dressings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000m356mbqoxvqnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Emerita at New York University, noted the new study is correlational and shows association, not causation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000n356mg3fy4i7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even so, it’s consistent with decades of evidence linking saturated fat to health risks and demonstrating quite substantial health benefits of substituting plant oils (including seed oils) for animal fats,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000o356m6d545vqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are derived from plant seeds, whereas plant-based oils are extracted from a variety of different plant parts. All oils examined in the study fall under the seed oil category, except for olive oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000p356mq8b1stpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Olive oil, canola oil, and soybean oil were each more consistently associated with benefit: a lower risk of dying,” said cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “These findings add to a large body of scientific literature on the health benefits of these plant oils, whose positive effects have been demonstrated in both large observational studies and dozens of randomized trials.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkpcl000i356mkz8st1d4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study indicates that some plant oils lead to better health outcomes, Zhang clarified that this doesn’t mean butter should be eliminated altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000w356m8u6hel68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are not suggesting that people should avoid butter entirely, but we are recommending that even a small reduction in butter in replacement for plant-based oils in a daily diet could lead to very substantial, long-term health benefits,” Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000x356m3aaqlpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The choice to use butter may depend on available options for the consumer, Willett said. If given the choice between butter and a partially hydrogenated plant oil rich in trans fats, he said, butter might be a better option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000z356mzaex96bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat#:~:text=Final%20Determination%20Regarding%20Partially%20Hydrogenated%20Oils%20(Removing%20Trans%20Fat),-Share&amp;amp;text=In%202015%2C%20FDA%20released%20its,levels%20in%20other%20edible%20oils." target="_blank"&gt;2015 ban&lt;/a&gt; on trans fats passed by the US Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers can still use up to a half of gram of trans fat per serving. That can add up fast in a daily diet, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114#:~:text=Products%20made%20before%20the%20FDA,amount%20is%20below%200.5%20grams." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0010356mcfr8z6l5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, if the decision is between butter and beef tallow — which has been promoted by Kennedy as a healthier substitute for seed oils — canola, soybean and olive oils are the superior choice, Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0011356mo6ehh0v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although beef tallow was not examined in this study, on the basis of its composition we would expect it to be no better than butter,” Willett said, pointing to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5081717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; he authored that found fat from red meat, which is mostly composed of beef fat, was marginally worse than dairy fat in regards to mortality or cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0012356m3cne1pjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is very high in saturated fat, approximately 2/3 of the fat, and it contains almost none of the beneficial, essential polysaturated fats,” Willett said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0013356m48apf9rn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings don’t mean that we should never consume butter, but it is best to use it just when its specific flavor is important, not as a primary source of fat,” he added. “For me, this is the several times a year that I have lobster … butter is absolutely essential!”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhlde3000u356m2zy31gqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re looking to make the switch to plant oils or debating which ones to use, it’s all about finding a balance to include some of the essential nutrients your body needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001a356m7175xqrq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Olive, canola and soybean oils had the most beneficial impact on health outcomes in the study, according to Zhang, which comes from their high levels of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s maintain the body’s cells, provide energy, maintain immune defense and reduce inflammation when it’s at optimal levels (like most things, too much omega-3 &lt;a href="https://news.oregonstate.edu/news/excess-omega-3-fatty-acids-could-lead-negative-health-effects" target="_blank"&gt;may be harmful&lt;/a&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001b356m9h2fmamr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other seed oils such as corn, peanut, safflower and sunflower contain higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids, which are also necessary to maintain good health.&lt;br&gt;Omega-6 molecules stimulate hair and skin growth, regulate metabolism, support bone health, and in some cases, may even have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/fish-oil-heart-wellness/index.html"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xix6es00053b6mvx4hnm61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, omega-6s can also be converted into molecules such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3081099/#:~:text=Prostaglandins%20play%20a%20key%20role,cardinal%20signs%20of%20acute%20inflammation." target="_blank"&gt;prostaglandins&lt;/a&gt; that signal the initiation of inflammation — not a bad thing when your body is trying to quickly repel an invader or tumor, but devastating if left smoldering for long periods without resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001d356mrajvtkds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Americans have an overabundance of omega-6s in their bodies due to their use in ultraprocessed foods and eating at fast food establishments. One omega 6, &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/omega-6-fatty-acids" target="_blank"&gt;linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#reference78" target="_blank"&gt;most common omega-6&lt;/a&gt; in the US food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001c356mrl6nbie5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids; soybean and canola oil have both,” Willett said. “Corn and sunflower oil have very little omega-3 fatty content; these can be part of a mix of different oils, but should not be relied upon as a sole source of plant oil.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001e356m8op9xti9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter which oils you’re using in your diet, it’s best to use them sparingly, Nestle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001f356ma260ua5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m always for varying food intake to the extent possible and that goes for oils, as well,” she said.  “All oils, no matter which, provide about 120 calories per tablespoon so are best used in the proverbial moderation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While drooling is a little known symptom of MND it is typically not the first sign of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include stiff or weak hands as well as muscles twitches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS six people are diagnosed with MND every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 5,000 adults in the UK have MND and people have about a one in 300 risk of developing the condition over the course of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It mainly affects people in there 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is just two to five years from the onset of symptoms. How quickly symptoms get worse varies between patients, it can happen in as little as seven months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle twitches and a weak grip are among the early signs of the condition, along with weakness in the leg or ankle, slurred speech and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that you should see your GP if you have difficulty holding or gripping objects a feeling of weakness in your legs and twitches or muscle cramps that keep happening, if they do not go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rugby League legend Rob Burrow was diagnosed with MND in 2019, before passing away last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His first symptom was slurred speech, which hit while he was attending an awards show. Friends just thought he was drunk slurring his words but tests revealed the devastating news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no cure for MND but doctors can provide treatments to help reduce the impact it has on a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics can also provide drugs that minimise the symptoms like drooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, inevitably patients will start to experience problems moving and may need a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As MND progresses patients can eventually need a ventilator, a machine to help them breathe, as well technology to help them communicate.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:00:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNTUZZNF9oVHNYZzJuaDI3eGd0Zy1xMjAwUWt3QU5tQkhTM01NR2R5T3BTanBhdDBJX3ZsUGtxYWtfU3Vpd2o1Wm0zR00xNVZVcWd2dXJHSzIyRlVhYi1TMmtTUVZ5d25pV2tNSklza2lod2JWRFUyVWVDVHFsUEtoRjNqdFNZTVg2aTRhelV4SVhTWnZETUHSAZsBQVVfeXFMT1h1aFBGQS05aGgyakJwNTU4aDZtdjlSRGtLUTU3Z182Zk0tdkdTUnJfal9ESGNiT0l0Wm9iWmIxdmRYWDByRTl0N0k1aklLMEVyNHJxTjdKTzUzbjNzeVBhVGZOM3YwZTJDVlVvZHltSV8tNHRIbkNVMWQ5WmU1V0w5Ykt5M2VRR1duU2MxemlJLWZxTDJsdm1xREk</guid></item><item><title>Why eating farmed fish may be safer than eating fish caught in the wild - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRmJYZERZWnpoZjMxeHhILTRqc0FHWmhDalNKLTVETlQ3LUYta2FiU2VBVWRWLXA0ZVE4RFppaUVuRGR1eVl3YnVwOVNmb0ZnbVphdGk1OUdIYUZPZzNuQ0I1Yjlna3NzTE0zbmQ0eUw1UjkzMHdFT0VRZi1XS0lHZFpqTVI0OUUyYWdjNmFIVHRYemdudVM3LVRWa2w2TWhI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmed fish are often viewed with suspicion, while wild-caught varieties are more likely to be perceived as healthy and pure. Seafood shoppers everywhere debate the differences and weigh their options carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh scientific review points to an unexpected conclusion. Various pollutants can accumulate in fish, and wild-caught individuals appear to experience greater exposure to these. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective is shared by &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0001-6007-8622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Isabel  Casanova-Martínez&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist who works under the auspices of several Spanish research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people recognize that &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/heavy-metal-blood-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt; pose a threat for food safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These substances include elements like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/elevated-mercury-levels-discovered-in-dolphins/"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/33/arsenic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arsenic&lt;/a&gt;, lead and others that can build up in tissue (bioaccumulate) over time. Certain types can be risky to humans if present in large amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that wild-caught fish carried an average mercury concentration of 0.06 micrograms per gram, while farmed fish had about half that, at 0.038 micrograms per gram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found arsenic levels of 3.26 micrograms per gram in wild fish, compared with 1.23 micrograms per gram in farmed varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ddt-and-other-pollutants"&gt;DDT and other pollutants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lesser-known concern is &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt;, which was once a widely used pesticide. Even though it was banned in many places years ago, traces can still linger. These residues can find their way into aquatic environments and accumulate in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review indicates around 196.48 nanograms per gram of DDT in wild-caught samples, whereas farmed fish had about 44.64 nanograms per gram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest differences in how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-small-fish-whole-reduces-cancer-risk-in-women/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; come into contact with old pesticide deposits, possibly due to habitat or feeding patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-some-fish-fare-better"&gt;Why some fish fare better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish produced through aquaculture may face stricter oversight in terms of feed and water conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations like the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/publications/fao-flagship-publications/the-state-of-world-fisheries-and-aquaculture/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt; note that this method continues to expand faster than other food sectors. Many producers track feeds and test water more regularly than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy metals can be introduced through industrial pollution, runoff, or other sources in natural waters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtered tanks or closely monitored pens could mean fewer contaminants find their way into farmed species, although no method removes the risks entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-risks-and-caution"&gt;Real-world risks and caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has identified mercury as being among the top chemicals of concern for public health, especially for expectant mothers and small children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High concentrations have been &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/health-effects-exposures-mercury"&gt;tied&lt;/a&gt; to neurological issues and developmental problems in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe daily or weekly seafood intake is still possible, but guidelines vary depending on a person’s overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often urge pregnant women to be particularly careful about the consumption of large, predatory fish as they are known to harbor elevated mercury levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-nutrition-and-contaminants"&gt;Balancing nutrition and contaminants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating fish brings many benefits. It offers protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and important minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fishwatch.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NOAA Fisheries&lt;/a&gt; underscores that fish are a valuable food, but also acknowledges that consumers should stay informed about possible contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrients, like &lt;a href="https://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/se.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, vary based on the fish’s environment and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmed diets often include formulated feeds that are designed to control final nutrient profiles. Wild species gain nutrients from ecosystems that are less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leading-author-s-viewpoint"&gt;Leading author’s viewpoint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than pitting wild fishing against aquaculture, our review demonstrates that both sectors can coexist and help meet the world’s seafood needs safely,” concluded Dr. Casanova-Martínez, lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Still, ongoing research and improvements in feed and environmental monitoring are essential for safeguarding public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations reflect the broader consensus that both systems are vital for feeding populations. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks that require further attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-regulation-matters"&gt;Why regulation matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory bodies set maximum allowed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nearly-100-million-americans-exposed-to-contaminated-drinking-water/"&gt;contaminant levels&lt;/a&gt; to keep consumers safe. Many fish samples in both categories fall within established safety margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous oversight helps the public gain confidence in what ends up on their plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities also caution special populations. Small children and pregnant individuals may need more careful advice about portion sizes, fish types, and heavy meal frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies need to adjust recommendations when new evidence emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-consumers"&gt;What’s next for consumers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aquaculture often employs best practices to reduce pollutants, yet wild-caught products remain popular for taste and tradition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can choose a balanced approach, selecting a mix of fish sources and staying updated on guidelines for safer consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional studies on feed technology and water filtration are ongoing. Research may reveal improved methods to cut contaminants and maintain fish quality in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heavy-metal-pollution-threatens-marine-life-and-human-health/"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt; and legacy pesticides should not overshadow the nutritional value of fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, consumers should be making informed choices by identifying reputable suppliers and following health advisories to ensure they reduce the intake of unwanted substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals looking for more detail can consult government websites or speak with healthcare providers for tailored advice. Monitoring official recommendations about fish intake can also safer meal planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713525000891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRmJYZERZWnpoZjMxeHhILTRqc0FHWmhDalNKLTVETlQ3LUYta2FiU2VBVWRWLXA0ZVE4RFppaUVuRGR1eVl3YnVwOVNmb0ZnbVphdGk1OUdIYUZPZzNuQ0I1Yjlna3NzTE0zbmQ0eUw1UjkzMHdFT0VRZi1XS0lHZFpqTVI0OUUyYWdjNmFIVHRYemdudVM3LVRWa2w2TWhI</guid></item><item><title>Do I need another measles shot?

                South African boys from a rural area are briefed by an health worker from Doctors Without Borders before undergoing medical circumcision as a form of HIV prevention. The U.S. has supported male circumcision programs in countries with high rates of HIV. In his address to Congress this week, President Donald Trump listed aid programs that he considers an "appalling waste" and included "$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique."

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/g-s1-50488/trump-congress-joint-address-fact-check" target="_blank"&gt;took a jab at a number of foreign aid programs&lt;/a&gt;. "Just listen to some of the appalling waste," he said and then rattled off a list of examples, including: "$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He's referring to one country but USAID — the United States Agency for International Development — has funded male circumcision programs in a number of countries in southern and eastern Africa through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts and HIV prevention advocates agree that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/prevention/voluntary-medical-male-circumcision" target="_blank"&gt;voluntary medical male circumcisions&lt;/a&gt; — a procedure where a medical provider removes the foreskin of a penis from a volunteer patient — are a highly effective prevention for HIV. The procedure has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission from women to men and is a cost-effective HIV prevention intervention in countries with high infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The procedure is recommended for males after the onset of puberty, when they are more likely to be sexually active, and differs from ceremonial circumcisions which are typically done by a non-medical provider in a non-medical setting. "The benefits of the procedure are for both [the patient] and their future partners, and ultimately, in a big way, for the community and country to reduce the spread of HIV," says &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-bershteyn" target="_blank"&gt;Anna Bershteyn&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of population health at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A local anesthetic is used in the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A 60% prevention benefit&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Voluntary medical male circumcision became a gold standard for HIV prevention in the early 2000s, after three groundbreaking research studies from the National Institutes of Health and the French National Agency for Research on AIDS revealed that African countries with higher rates of male circumcision had &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241595988" target="_blank"&gt;lower rates of HIV infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If a man is circumcised, it will reduce his chance of acquiring HIV by 60%," says &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Mahy&lt;/a&gt;, the director for Data for Impact at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists still don't know for sure how removal of foreskin reduces risk of HIV infection, but research suggests that male foreskin has a larger number of a certain type of cells that HIV grabs onto. Bershteyn says there's evidence that when the foreskin is removed during circumcision, the skin on the penis changes and the number of HIV-vulnerable cells on the skin's surface is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"But aside from understanding the how, we have incredibly strong evidence from multiple randomized trials that, whatever the mechanisms, this procedure greatly reduces the risk of HIV infection," says Bershteyn.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2007, on the heels of these research findings, the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS began recommending voluntary medical male circumcisions in countries with high HIV prevalence and low rates of circumcision. Shortly after, PEPFAR, which is mainly overseen by USAID, stepped up its efforts to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663585/" target="_blank"&gt;support male circumcision programs&lt;/a&gt; around the world, including in Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Over the last 18 years, governments around eastern and southern Africa, where there are high risks amongst men having vaginal sex, began to work with PEPFAR, the Global Fund and community groups and advocates to begin to scale up access to circumcision," says &lt;a href="https://avac.org/mitchell-warren/" target="_blank"&gt;Mitchell Warren&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention non-profit organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Warren notes that PEPFAR and other groups didn't focus on circumcising men everywhere but instead used data-driven approaches to target specific regions that have high rates of HIV and low rates of circumcisions — including Mozambique. Since 2007, PEPFAR has supported &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar" target="_blank"&gt;32.5 million voluntary medical male circumcisions&lt;/a&gt; in men and boys.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Mozambique, the Mozambican Ministry of Health developed a national male circumcision strategy in 2009, with the support of PEPFAR. According to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.20.24317610v1" target="_blank"&gt;research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, between 2010-2023, more than 2.5 million voluntary medical male circumcisions were performed in the country, with 41% in boys younger than 15. And among those who received circumcisions, less than 2% became infected with HIV. This research has yet to be peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And unlike other prevention tools like oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and condoms, because the procedure only has to be done once, male circumcisions are &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2023-voluntary-medical-male-circumcision-shown-to-be-highly-cost-effective--highlighting-the-need-to-intensify-scale-up-and-sustainability" target="_blank"&gt;cost effective as HIV prevention&lt;/a&gt;. "The investment made in voluntary male medical circumcision actually pays for itself relatively quickly," says Bershteyn, and can "lighten the burden on governments and on donor agencies that are trying to prevent HIV deaths," since protected individuals don't require costly and lifelong treatments.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Warren says male circumcisions are "one of the best [HIV] prevention investments we have."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to the State Department for comment on Trump's remarks but did not receive a response in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bec Roldan is an independent science journalist based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

&lt;p&gt;Further, detailed examination of the participants' immune responses showed not only systemic response, but responses in distant mucus membranes. In the blood, two types of antibodies (IgA and IgG) increased by several fold after vaccination compared with the placebo group. The group with the largest responses was the one that received the high dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test that acts as a surrogate for neutralizing antibody responses to norovirus indicated that the antibodies spurred by the vaccine could block the virus. Additional tests found that cellular immune responses were also activated and that the systemic responses result in protection in places far from the intestines—namely the mouth and nose. Saliva tests and nasal swabs found significant jumps in secreted IgA against norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune responses were strongest in the first two months after vaccination and diminished over time, but some persisted for nearly seven months. When the scientists looked at differences between the two age groups (55–65 and 65–80), they didn't see significant differences, suggesting the vaccine was equally effective in the older group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the scientists at Vaxart concluded that the vaccine "has the potential to inhibit infection, viral shedding, and transmission."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, VXA-G1.1-NN administration in older adults led to robust and durable immunogenicity detected both in circulation and multiple mucosal sites, an exciting outcome considering that diminished cellular and mucosal immunity are typical in older populations," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not so good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook isn't entirely rosy, though—there is some bad news. While immune responses rose in statistically significant measures during this small early-stage trial, it's unclear if that equates to real-life protection. And there's some good reason to be wary. In 2023, Vaxart &lt;a href="https://vaxart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vaxart-Monovalent-Norovirus-Challenge-Study-Data-Review.pdf"&gt;released results of a challenge study&lt;/a&gt;, in which 141 brave souls (76 vaccinated and 65 given a placebo) were deliberately exposed to norovirus to see if the vaccine was protective. The results were weak: 53 placebo-group members (81.5 percent) became infected with norovirus, as determined by a PCR test looking for genetic evidence of the virus in their stool—and so did 76 vaccinated people (60 percent). That worked out to the vaccine offering only &lt;a href="https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-announces-topline-data-phase-2-challenge-study-its"&gt;a 29 percent lower relative risk of getting infected&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at whether infected people developed symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, the vaccine had a protective efficacy of about 21 percent: 34 vaccinated people (48 percent) versus 37 placebo-group members (57 percent) developed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified a critical “midlife window” for preventing age-related brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2416433122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled that brain aging follows a distinct yet nonlinear trajectory with critical transition points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This represents a paradigm shift in how we think about brain aging prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted by an international team of scientists led by Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi of Stony Brook University, offers new insights into when interventions to prevent cognitive decline might be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed functional communication between brain regions (brain networks) in more than 19,300 individuals across four large-scale datasets. Their findings reveal that the brain networks degrade in a manner that follows an S-shaped statistical curve with clear transition points, rather than either the late-life clinical onset or gradual linear decline previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is first seen around age 44, with the degeneration hitting peak acceleration around age 67 and plateauing by age 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work by the team, led by collaborator Nathan Smith, had shown that the brain’s signaling is impacted by neurons’ loss of energy (hypometabolism). Thus, population-level transition points suggest there are specific windows when intervention could be most impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding exactly when and how brain aging accelerates gives us strategic timepoints for intervention,” says lead author Mujica-Parodi, director of the Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics (LCNeuro), chair for metabolic neuroscience, and professor of biomedical engineering in the Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve identified a critical midlife window where the brain begins to experience declining access to energy but before irreversible damage occurs, essentially the ‘bend’ before the ‘break.’ During midlife, neurons are metabolically stressed due to insufficient fuel; they’re struggling, but they’re still viable,” Mujica-Parodi explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, providing an alternative fuel during this critical window can help restore function. However, by later ages, neurons’ prolonged starvation may have triggered a cascade of other physiological effects that make intervention less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers not only mapped this aging trajectory but identified its primary driver: neuronal insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers, they found that metabolic changes consistently preceded vascular and inflammatory ones. Gene expression analyses further implicated the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4 and the lipid transport protein APOE (a known &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/exhausted-immune-cells-alzheimers-disease-3165972/"&gt;Alzheimer’s risk factor&lt;/a&gt;) in these aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these same gene expression analyses also identified the neuronal ketone transporter MCT2 as a potential protective factor, suggesting that enhancing the brain’s ability to utilize ketones—an alternative brain fuel that neurons can metabolize without insulin—might be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding of the ketone transporter then motivated an interventional study, in which researchers compared administration of individually weight-dosed and calorically matched glucose and ketones to 101 participants at different stages along the aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects were striking in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike glucose, ketones effectively stabilized deteriorating brain networks, but with effects that differed significantly across critical transition points. Ketones showed moderate benefits in young adults (20-39 years), showed maximum benefits during the midlife “metabolic stress” period (40-59 years) after which networks begin destabilizing, but had diminished impact in older adults (60-79 years) once the network destabilization hit maximum acceleration and the domination of compounding vascular effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mujica-Parodi and coauthors say that these findings could revolutionize approaches to &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/games-puzzles-slow-cognitive-decline-3253082/"&gt;preventing&lt;/a&gt; age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments typically target symptoms after they appear, often too late for meaningful intervention. This research suggests that metabolic intervention—whether through dietary approaches like ketogenic diets or supplements—might be most effective when started in one’s 40s, well before cognitive symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This represents a paradigm shift in how we think about brain aging prevention,” notes Botond Antal, postdoctoral associate in biomedical engineering at Stony Brook and first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than waiting for cognitive symptoms, which may not appear until substantial damage has occurred, we can potentially identify people at risk through neurometabolic markers and intervene during this critical window.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a public health standpoint, these findings could inform new screening guidelines and preventive approaches, emphasizes Mujica-Parodi. Early (mid-life) identification of increasing insulin resistance in the brain (not just the blood), coupled with targeted metabolic interventions, might substantially delay cognitive aging for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the global population aging rapidly and dementia cases projected to triple by 2050, these insights into the timing and mechanisms of brain aging offer new hope for preventive strategies that could maintain cognitive health well into later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional researchers from Stony Brook University, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Oxford University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the research came from the WM Keck Foundation and the National Science Foundation (NSF) Brain Research through Advancing Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
