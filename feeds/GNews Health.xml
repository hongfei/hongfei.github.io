Federal data released Friday, for example, shows COVID-19 is trending up in most states, with emergency department visits up among people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what to know about summer viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much are colds and the flu circulating right now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of people seeking medical care for three key illnesses — COVID-19, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV — is currently very low, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu is trending down and RSV has been steady. But COVID-19 is trending up in most states. Wastewater data from around the country estimates "moderate" COVID-19 activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC wastewater also shows the XFG variant — nicknamed "stratus" — is most common in the U.S. Stratus can cause a "razor blade" sore throat and is considered a "variant under monitoring" by the World Health Organization. The WHO said the variant is only marginally better at evading people's immune systems and vaccines still work against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectation is that COVID-19 will eventually settle into a winter seasonal pattern like other coronaviruses, but the past few years have brought a late summer surge, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at University of California, Davis Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other viruses circulating this time of year include the one that causes "hand, foot and mouth" disease — which has symptoms similar to a cold, plus sores and rashes — and norovirus, sometimes called the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do viruses spread less in the summer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many viruses circulate seasonally, picking up as the weather cools in the fall and winter. So it's true that fewer people get stuffy noses and coughs in the summer — but cold weather itself does not cause colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just about seasonality. The other factor is our behavior, experts say. Nice weather means people are opening windows and gathering outside where it's harder for germs to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But respiratory viruses are still around. When the weather gets too hot and everyone heads inside for the air conditioning, doctors say they start seeing more sickness. In places where it gets really hot for a long time, summer can be cold season in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I grew up on the East Coast and everybody gets sick in the winter," said Dr. Frank LoVecchio, an emergency room doctor and Arizona State University researcher. "A lot of people get sick in the summer here. Why is that? Because you spend more time indoors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;With stratus spreading, should you get another COVID-19 booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are otherwise healthy, timing is a key consideration to getting any vaccine. You want to get it a few weeks before that big trip or wedding, if that's the reason for getting boosted, doctors say. But, for most people, it may be worth waiting until the fall in anticipation of winter cases of COVID-19 really ticking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to be fully protected at the time that it's most important for you," said Dr. Costi Sifri, of the University of Virginia Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at higher risk of complications should always talk with their doctor about what is best for them, Sifri added. Older adults and those with weak immune systems may need more boosters than others, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;A lot of people get sick in the summer (in Arizona). Why is that? Because you spend more time indoors.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Frank LoVecchio, Arizona State University&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are more younger kids getting sick with COVID-19?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the CDC noted emergency room visits among children younger than 4 were rising. That makes sense, Blumberg said, because many young kids are getting it for the first time or are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51320066" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt; that the shots would no longer be recommended for healthy kids, a decision that health experts have said lacks scientific basis. The American Academy of Pediatrics still endorses COVID-19 shots for children older than 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How else can I lower my risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same things that help prevent colds, the flu and COVID any other time of the year work in the summer, doctors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend time outside when you can, wash your hands, wear a mask. And if you're sick, stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Known as Chagas disease, it is carried by the so-called “kissing bug,” a small insect that feeds around the face and leaves behind dangerous parasites. Now confirmed in dozens of states, including California, Texas, and Florida, Chagas is creeping into public awareness as more cases and the silent risks emerge. What’s more concerning? Without early detection and treatment, this condition can quietly damage the heart and digestive system and lead to fatal complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising threat across the US&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and carried by triatomine insects known as kissing bugs, has entered a new chapter in the United States. Once rare and primarily confined to Latin America, it’s now detected in at least 32 US states, with human cases confirmed in eight states, including California and Texas, and researchers urge classifying it as endemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a CDC-backed study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases recommends updating Chagas’ status due to consistent local transmission, especially in the South. In Texas, more than 50 human cases were locally acquired between 2013 and 2023, and canine infection rates in some kennels hit 31%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildlife like opossums and raccoons help sustain the parasite in the environment. In California, particularly in Los Angeles and San Diego, kissing bugs carrying T. cruzi are increasingly common, raising alarm for possible spread to places like the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Chagas Disease, and why is it deadly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is a parasitic infection transmitted when kissing bug feces containing T. cruzi enter the body, often through skin contact or mucous membranes. These bugs usually bite around the face during sleep and then defecate near the wound, allowing the parasite to infiltrate the body, requiring just a scratch for entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early symptoms: What to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease unfolds in two phases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Acute Phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lasting weeks or months, this phase is often mild or silent. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, rash, swollen eyelids (known as Romaña’s sign), body aches, headache, and digestive upset. Because these signs mimic common illnesses or don’t appear at all, many people may never realize they’ve been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic Phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Occurring decades later, chronic infection affects about 20-30% of individuals and can cause fatal heart complications like heart failure, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, as well as digestive tract issues like an enlarged esophagus or colon. In many cases, the first sign may be a life-threatening event like a heart attack or stroke, especially in individuals unaware of their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who’s at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the surge in this many states across the country, awareness regarding this particular disease remains extremely low. Even though roughly 300,000 people in the US are estimated to be infected, fewer than 2% know they carry the parasite. In Los Angeles County alone, around 45,000 cases are thought to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Risk factors include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in or near southern or rural regions where kissing bugs thrive, such as Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working or sleeping in poorly constructed buildings or outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact with wildlife reservoirs or pets that carry the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barriers to detection include low physician awareness, lack of routine screening, and the silent nature of early infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis and treatment&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis of Chagas disease involves blood tests to detect the parasite in the acute phase or to identify antibodies during chronic infection. Prompt testing is vital, especially if exposure is suspected and vague symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to treating the disease, it involves antiparasitic medications like benznidazole and nifurtimox. These are most effective early in the infection, achieving cure rates of up to 80-100% in acute or congenital cases. Efficacy drops in chronic infections, but treatment can still slow disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who develop serious heart or digestive issues, management may involve medications, pacemakers, or even heart transplantation, which can help patients live well post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention: How to stay safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no vaccine exists yet, public health officials recommend these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid contact with kissing bugs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seal cracks around doors and windows, maintain screens, and eliminate nearby debris or wild animal nests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Use vector control practices:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smoke out bugs, use insecticides, and bed netting where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Screening and diagnosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get tested if you live in risk areas, or if symptoms arise.

New research suggests that the right kind of sleep can help ward off memory trouble in people whose brains already show signs of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studied older adults with no diagnosed dementia and found something striking. When these adults spent more time in the deepest stage of sleep, their memory held up better even if amyloid deposits were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-amyloid-plaque"&gt;Understanding amyloid plaque&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked with Alzheimer’s disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/amyloid-plaque" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt; are clumps of protein fragments, called amyloid-beta, that build up between nerve cells in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, your body produces and clears these protein fragments without a problem. But in Alzheimer’s, the cleanup process doesn’t keep up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fragments start sticking together, first in small clusters that may be toxic, and eventually in larger, sticky deposits known as plaques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These plaques interfere with how neurons communicate, almost like static on a phone line, and they can also trigger the brain’s immune cells to overreact, causing damaging inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists study amyloid because it seems to play a central role in the chain of events that leads to memory loss and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the tricky part: we still don’t know if amyloid plaques are the main cause of the disease or more like a byproduct of deeper problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-brain-waves-and-alzheimer-s"&gt;Sleep, brain waves, and Alzheimer’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tracked 62 cognitively healthy older adults and measured sleep and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; on the same timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure amyloid in the brain and monitored sleep with electroencephalography to capture brain waves overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep here means NREM slow-wave sleep, a stage marked by large, slow oscillations that help the brain reset. The team then gave participants a face-name memory task the next day and compared performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work comes from Matthew Walker and colleagues at the University of California, &lt;a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. The project also examined whether sleep helped beyond other known cognitive reserve factors like education and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deep-sleep-resets-the-brain"&gt;Deep sleep resets the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep helps the brain tune synapses and prepare for new learning the next day. It also supports the transfer of fragile short-term memories into more stable long-term storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another piece that matters for Alzheimer’s biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sleep, the brain’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/space-travel-alters-the-flow-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-in-the-brain/"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt; ramps up clearance of waste proteins, including amyloid and tau, by moving cerebrospinal fluid through tiny channels that flush neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-findings-from-older-adult-brains"&gt;Findings from older adult brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people with similarly high amyloid levels, more deep sleep lined up with stronger next-day memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That link was specific to the deep, slow-wave part of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, not lighter sleep or REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of deep sleep almost like a life raft that keeps memory afloat, rather than memory being dragged down by the weight of Alzheimer’s disease pathology,” said Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit appeared where it was needed most – in those carrying a higher amyloid burden. It also remained even after accounting for age, sex, body mass index, gray matter atrophy, education, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-sleep-higher-alzheimer-s-risk"&gt;Poor sleep, higher Alzheimer’s risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short sleep in older adults is linked to more amyloid and lower &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large analysis of more than 4,000 adults found a higher amyloid burden among those reporting six hours or fewer per night, along with worse memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers see a two-way pattern. Poor sleep can go hand in hand with rising amyloid, and rising amyloid can disrupt sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These feedback loops make sleep a practical target. It is a daily behavior with clear, measurable features and plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pills-don-t-replace-deep-sleep"&gt;Pills don’t replace deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all sleep is equal, and some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/natures-sleep-aid-cannabinol-shows-promise-as-a-safe-sedative/"&gt;sedatives&lt;/a&gt; change the structure of sleep in unhelpful ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 review reported that benzodiazepines tend to reduce the time spent in the deepest NREM stages while expanding lighter stage 2 sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also interest in a newer class of sleep medicines that act on the orexin system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small randomized trial, the insomnia drug suvorexant reduced cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau over several hours in healthy middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings do not mean a pill will protect memory or that anyone should change treatment without medical guidance. However, they do suggest that the type and depth of sleep matter at least as much as the number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-better-sleep-lower-alzheimer-s-risk"&gt;Better sleep, lower Alzheimer’s risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple habits can tilt sleep toward deeper stages. Avoiding caffeine – especially later in the day – helps the brain reach consolidated slow-wave sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement, a cool and dark bedroom, fewer screens at night, and even a warm shower an hour before bed can all make it easier to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists still need long-term studies to determine whether training &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-clears-toxic-waste-from-the-brain/"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt; over months or years can slow cognitive decline in people with rising amyloid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams are also exploring safe ways to amplify slow waves during sleep, using sound cues or gentle electrical stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is simple: help the brain keep learning day after day, even in the face of early disease markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 21:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNa2RzSEVod2xEaUJCRXBxbjhtcjZlVmRHR0Z6NTlNSlctNEZlVXFScjFRU3J1QjNGSVB2dFRoY002LXdNRkpkTjlDNmV4M2ZkbXJtMmNUZ1J4YnJEaHRMa2ktNktmaUdrRHpJS1piTHdpWWZ1Tk40R0VqNXNQVS1TVXhuQ1QtbjR1akJ6WTZnb1FsbmNkZkoyTTVucEJTU2xncW8teUtTV2hNRXJHNFE</guid></item><item><title>对您是否有资格接种新冠疫苗感到困惑？在华盛顿州，您可享受保障- KUOW</title><link>https://www.kuow.org/stories/confused-about-your-eligibility-for-the-covid-shot-in-washington-state-you-re-covered</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Washington state’s health department is trying to straighten out confusion about who can or should get a Covid vaccine — and has given legal heft to their recommendation. Thanks to a &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/COVID19VaccineStandingOrder.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;standing order&lt;/a&gt; signed by the state health officer Thursday, anyone in the state can get the vaccine without consulting their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standing order means that pharmacists, nurses, and other health care providers can give the Covid vaccine to everyone 6 months or older, including pregnant people, unless there’s a specific, individual reason not to. The agency issued the order in the wake of confusing and sometimes conflicting guidance from the federal government about who’s eligible for the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RELATED&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/senators-from-both-parties-grilled-rfk-jr-on-vaccines-and-more" target="_blank"&gt;Senators from both parties grilled RFK Jr. on vaccines and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state agency said they continue to recommend that everyone stay up to date with the most recent Covid shot. That’s in line with advice from the major medical associations of pediatricians, family doctors, and OB-GYNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standing order is a prescription from the state health officer that addresses a disease or health threat — such as &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/Pubs/150-127-StatewideStandingOrderToDispenseNaloxone.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;one that authorizes pharmacists to give Naloxone&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who wants it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="story-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This standing order gives legal cover to pharmacists, who might be confused about to whom they’re allowed to give the shot, and it gives all Washington state residents the right to get vaccinated, if they choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state health agency said &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/3481125-COVID19VaccineFAQForPublic.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;people can bring a printed copy of the order to their vaccine appointment&lt;/a&gt; at, say, a pharmacy, if they’re worried they could be denied the shot. If they still cannot get vaccinated, they can file a complaint against the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on state Medicaid, or Apple Health, can get the Covid vaccine for free. For people with private insurance, coverage will depend on their individual health status and insurer, but many insurance companies are expected to continue covering the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

This is because other animals have an active gene for an enzyme called uricase, which breaks down uric acid in the blood and thereby prevents the formation of crystals. However, due to a number of mutations picked up over our evolutionary history, the uricase enzyme in humans cannot process uric acid. Some researchers believe this happened because increased levels of uric acid can also turn fruit sugar into fat, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1096/fj.13-243634" target="_blank" data-url="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1096/fj.13-243634" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;helping primates survive winters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and grow bigger brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/us-baby-receives-first-ever-customized-crispr-treatment-for-genetic-disease" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/us-baby-receives-first-ever-customized-crispr-treatment-for-genetic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US baby receives first-ever customized CRISPR treatment for genetic disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320393111" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320393111" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously identified&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which ancient genes may have been responsible for producing uricase by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/3/msac041/6530294" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/3/msac041/6530294" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inferring ancestral genes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This means figuring out what the genes of ancient organisms looked like by studying the DNA of living species today. Scientists compare the genes of different animals or people, use computer programs to build family trees, and then make educated guesses about what the original, ancient gene sequences were. Once they have a good idea of what those old genes looked like, they can recreate and "resurrect" the ancient proteins that the genes encode in the lab and possibly open the door to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers used CRISPR gene editing to insert the ancient uricase gene into the genomes of human &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/12/2228" target="_blank" data-url="https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/12/2228" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;liver spheroids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spheroids are 3D blobs of lab-grown tissues that mimic complex, full-size organs found in the body. The insertion of the ancient gene resulted in a drop in uric acid, as well as a reduction in fat buildup related to fruit sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are existing gout therapies that use uricase to manage high levels of uric acid; for example, the treatment &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.krystexxa.com/?cid=PPC-accountype:GOOGLE-campaign:CP2TYXD_25_NEP_KRX_UG_DTC_BRND_SRC_AL_GO_Core_N/A_7300806379-searchterm:krystexxa-adgroup:Core-keywordid:p81859646413&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwzt_FBhCEARIsAJGFWVk8zNOrHHvHxXoddGa6TgHCWlxwzzi9N4WEgkSWsXDBhzQ50TXFsMMaArrxEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22451017598&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADNzm_rBfI_Cg7BvcHx8f_Mchb1gd" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.krystexxa.com/?cid=PPC-accountype:GOOGLE-campaign:CP2TYXD_25_NEP_KRX_UG_DTC_BRND_SRC_AL_GO_Core_N/A_7300806379-searchterm:krystexxa-adgroup:Core-keywordid:p81859646413&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwzt_FBhCEARIsAJGFWVk8zNOrHHvHxXoddGa6TgHCWlxwzzi9N4WEgkSWsXDBhzQ50TXFsMMaArrxEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22451017598&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADNzm_rBfI_Cg7BvcHx8f_Mchb1gd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Krystexxa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involves injections of uricase proteins made using a combination of pig and baboon gene sequences. However, these protein-based therapeutics often elicit &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017216302888" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017216302888" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strong immune responses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and require clinical monitoring due to the risk of anaphylactic shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a gene therapy that restores the original, ancient human gene sequence could enable the body's own cells to produce uricase. In theory, the immune reactions could be minimized because much of the uricase protein sequence is already recognized and accepted by the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers have a long way to go before such a gene therapy could be used in human patients. For next steps, they are transitioning from liver spheroids to lab mice, and they're using nanoparticle delivery systems that introduce CRISPR gene-editing components directly into liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="666e1d2d-d576-44c1-b766-a7aed78bd3c1"&gt;Such a gene therapy has the potential to transform gout treatment by providing a long-lasting and possibly safer alternative to current therapies, the researchers say. Gene-editing therapies like this, however, are still in early stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that this approach — of taking and adapting ancient genes for modern therapies — could be more broadly applied in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My ultimate goal is to be able to wed molecular evolution and clinical medicine," Gaucher said. "Ideally we can use ancient proteins or ancient enzymes to develop therapeutics to help modern society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ-NgRdMxYMdMNQqo8DYgk0mkb4gKC5DiiR" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-bWE8zqcR4swuDdR3r6wqxZ-NgRdMxYMdMNQqo8DYgk0mkb4gKC5DiiR slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="p-2703-background-1" class="anchor" href="#p-2703-background-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is currently facing concurrent outbreaks including mpox, cholera and malaria (1-4). The Ministry of Public Health, DRC has declared the 16th Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak on 04 September 2025 after PCR confirmation of Ebola virus (EBOV), formely &lt;em&gt;Zaïre ebolavirus,&lt;/em&gt;  in patient’s specimens from Bulape Heath Zone, in Kasai Province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The re-emergence of EBOV in remote areas with very limited access is not unprecedent since 15 Ebola outbreaks have previously occurred in the country &lt;a href="https://10.1016/S2666-5247(23)00259-8" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"&gt;(5)&lt;/a&gt;. In late August 2025, the local health authorities in Bulape Heath Zone, Kasai Province, DRC raised an alert about cases presenting with haemorrhagic fever symptoms and associated fatalities among both infected individuals and healthcare workers. Suspecting EVD, a buccal swab (from a fatal case) and five blood specimens were collected from six suspected cases then shipped to the national reference laboratory, Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa, for diagnosis confirmation and whole genome sequencing (WGS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="p-2703-methods-2" class="anchor" href="#p-2703-methods-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 03 September 2025, six samples were tested at INRB using the point-of-care GeneXpert Ebola assay, the automated BioFire FilmArray System (Global Fever Panel), and real-time PCR with Altona RealStar Filovirus RT-PCR kit. EBOV PCR positive samples were subsequently sequenced on a nanopore sequencing device (Oxford Nanopore Technology).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 140 µL of inactivated specimens using viral RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with LunaScript RT SuperMix kit (New England Biolabs). Multiplex PCR was performed on cDNA using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X master mix (New England Biolabs), and EBOV-specific primer pools, designed for EBOV Mangina variants, were used to amplify the EBOV genome. Library was prepared in triplicate using the rapid sequencing DNA V14 barcoding kit (SQK-RBK114.96; Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing library was loaded on a R10.4.1 flow cell and run on a GridION sequencer. Reads were base called with the High accuracy model from Guppy. Subsequently, iVar tool ( &lt;a href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"&gt;GitHub - andersen-lab/ivar: iVar is a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing.&lt;/a&gt; ) was used for trimming sequencing adapters, primers, and low-quality bases, and for generating the consensus genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="p-2703-results-and-discussion-3" class="anchor" href="#p-2703-results-and-discussion-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results and Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to generate an accurate consensus genome in less than one hour starting from the library preparation. The newly EBOV genome is 99.97% complete and consists of 18,819 nucleotides. Multiple sequence alignment of 71 complete EBOV genomes, including the newly generated genome, was performed using MAFFT (6). A phylogenetic tree (&lt;a href="/404"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;) was constructed using IQ-TREE v2.1.4 (7). The new EBOV genome has a nucleotide similarity of 99.52% to the most closely related genome, Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-Mayinga (GenBank accession number NC_002549.1), suggesting that this case represents a new zoonotic spillover event and is not directly linked to the 2007 Luebo or 2008/2009 Mweka EVD outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta vividly remembers the day he impaled himself on a wrought iron fence. He had just turned 12, and he was running through the neighborhood when he spontaneously decided to vault over a fence that he usually ran around. Except he didn't quite make it. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the spikes caught me on my side and went in the back area of my side and out the front," Gupta says. "It was the skin, thankfully, as opposed to going into the chest or into the abdomen, which would have been much worse, but it was sort of a classic in-out sort of injury."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Gupta says he was impaled for several minutes before his mother arrived to help hoist him off the fence. Looking back now, he remembers feeling a strange sense of euphoria when it happened, which he attributes to his body's natural pain relief system. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For some people, it reacts really vigorously — like really, really churns out a bunch of endorphins," he says. "And so you could have this really sort of ironic situation where you've got a terrible injury and you're almost laughing. It's a very protective sort of response from the body. And not everyone responds the same way."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his new book, &lt;em&gt;It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life&lt;/em&gt;, Gupta, a trained neurosurgeon, writes about pain — what causes it, and the various medications that can be used to treat it. He also reflects on ways to train the mind to minimize certain kinds of pain, using distraction and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"With pain, people are usually hyper-focused on a particular sensation. Being able to take them out of that hyper-focus can be really helpful," he says. "The idea [is] that you could take someone's pain score from really terrible pain to a zero out of 10 ... for the 30 minutes that they are meditating. ... I think the brain can be trained that way."&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On mistakes the brain makes in processing pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the best examples of how the brain can make a mistake is phantom limb pain ... It was amputated, and yet it still hurts. I think that's one of those sort of insights about the brain that I think led to a lot of learning about what exactly the brain's role was with pain. If the brain's the decider of pain, can it create pain as well? And the answer is yes. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Referred pain is another sort of mistake. So some people may be having what should be chest pain from a heart attack, but instead of having chest pain, they may have jaw pain. They may have just left arm pain. ... And then there's sorts of things where whatever the reason may be, the brain continues to play the loop of pain over and over again. I guess that's not so much a mistake as it is maybe some sort of glitch, where the pain loop doesn't stop and it just gets recycled over and over again, and that's chronic pain. So those are some of the ways that the brain can sort of either mistake or misinterpret the signals and the pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how pleasure can rewire brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What I think is really interesting is that we have this system within our body, the endogenous opioid system. … This is like our internal morphine system, endorphin system. We can activate this system in all sorts of different ways. And by activating, I mean exactly what it sounds like. You just basically release a lot of these endorphins, these basically personalized morphine molecules all throughout your body. And one of the ways that they have shown can really facilitate that is to not just practice gratitude, but to actively practice gratitude. Meaning, actually savor something. I'm not just grateful for this ice cream cone. I'm so enjoying this ice-cream cone. I'm just not grateful for being able to look at this sunset. I am gazing at every different color in the sky and just taking it all in. It's a very active form of gratitude. And it seems to be very associated with basically activating the endogenous opioid system, which is really fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On opioid drugs compared to the body's natural opioid system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So many techniques and medications that we use in real life take their inspiration from our human body, and that's one of them. … With your own opioid system, it is very, very sensitive. So it can turn on and it can turn off really, really well. So instead of having the lingering sort of side effects of opioids and sedation and all these other things, the opioids that you make yourself can just be washed away very, very quickly. … &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I always say if the endogenous opioid system didn't exist, women would probably never have more than one child. It can be a painful experience, but those [natural] opioids help with the pain. They help with the mood, and … [they] can actually inhibit your memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how inflammation serves a purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I think for the most part, inflammation has sort of gotten a bad rap. ... I think when you look at a sprained ankle, for example, and it looks swollen and red, the idea that I want to get rid of that. That's associated with my pain makes intuitive sense. I think the idea that that inflammation serves a real purpose, that not only is it sort of helping protect the site of injury, but also sending all these various molecules to the site of injury to help with the healing. ...&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The thing about pain is that everyone's threshold is going to be a little bit different. … I think for a lot of people, they think they need to take anti-inflammatories. Oh, this is bad, I gotta treat that, that inflammation's not good, that's hurting my body. But if I flip the script on you and I say, "It's not bad for your body, that is exactly how your body is supposed to work. This is your body doing its job."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a new FDA approved non-opioid pain medication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The medication is called Suzetrigine. … It is a fascinating story of how it came about. There were these families of circus performers in Karachi, Pakistan. That got the attention of researchers, whatever, 25, 30 years ago. And they saw that these circus performers were able to do all these remarkable things, like they could put sharp things through their appendages and they could walk on hot coals and do all that sort of stuff. But what they found was that when they were doing this, they could feel the coals on their feet and they could feel that they were hot, they just didn't have pain. … And that was pretty striking because it gave these researchers a clue as to which sodium channel blocker may be important when it came to just targeting pain and not sensation overall. They studied this family. They found that they had a gene in common. ... And basically for 25 years, these researchers tried to replicate what that gene was doing in the body. ... Now, one of the big challenges of creating a medicine like that is you didn't want to take away pain forever. Pain has utility. It can keep you safe. It can teach you lessons. So they wanted to create a half-life for the drug. So they basically now have an oral formulation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resnx-s1-5527017-103" class="bucketwrap pullquote"&gt;
            
   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Cannabis for pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I walked into it thinking that if I really examined all this literature, there was going to be a pretty compelling case made for using cannabis for all sorts of different pains … and I walked away not as impressed, to be quite honest, as I thought I would be. And this is just the data talking. I will say it's hard to collect this data when you're dealing with a substance that has been a level one substance in the United States for a long time. It's just really hard to get good studies.  …&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But having said that, the best available data seem to suggest that for about a third of the people, it could be pretty effective, and maybe in some cases as effective as the best other options for that neuropathic pain. … For about two-thirds of people, it really did not seem to be that effective. And this is the case, I think, for about a third of people, they get significant benefit. And we don't quite know who those third of the people are. We don't know what makes them different than the other two-thirds that they're getting that kind of relief.  &lt;/p&gt;

      Results for the flu vaccine appear in Maps, but not COVID. The only working COVID results are hundreds of miles away.

          &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars reached out to Google for an explanation, receiving a cryptic and somewhat unsatisfying reply. "Showing accurate information on Maps is a top priority," says a Google spokesperson. "We’re working to fix this technical issue."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we are not aware of other Maps searches that have been similarly affected. Google has yet to respond to further questions on the nature of the apparent glitch, which has wiped out COVID vaccine information in Maps while continuing to return results for other medical services and immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden eroding of federal support for routine vaccinations lurks in the background with this bizarre issue. When the Trump administration decided to rename the Gulf of Mexico, Google was widely hectored for &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/bowing-to-trump-google-maps-plans-to-quickly-rename-the-gulf-of-mexico/"&gt;its decision to quickly show&lt;/a&gt; "Gulf of America" on its maps, aligning with the administration's preferred nomenclature. With the ramping up of anti-vaccine actions at the federal level, it is tempting to see a similar, nefarious purpose behind these disappearing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, we have no evidence that the change in Google's search results was intentional or targeted specifically at COVID immunization—indeed, making that change in such a ham-fisted way would be inadvisable. It does seem like an ill-timed and unusually specific "technical issue," though. If Google provides further details on the missing search results, we'll post an update.&lt;/p&gt;

However, instead of making her value her life and body more, the experience has made her hedonistic!&lt;/p&gt;

Her logic is, she was healthy before and still developed cancer, why not indulge? I’ve shared with her that alcohol is carcinogenic, and studies have shown that healthy diets and exercise make a significant difference in cancer survival, but she keeps saying that it’s her choice. She even kicked me out of her house the last time I was there! I have high blood pressure so I can’t eat certain foods, and she has cancer and needs to steer clear of anything that will trigger it. It’s not her fault, but that’s what it is to have a disease. She refuses to discuss any of this, and every conversation ends in a fight now. How do I get through to her that this is not judgement, it’s concern for her very life?&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, so, when people are lucky enough to survive cancer, they have all sorts of feelings! In the past 18 months since my stage 1 lung cancer surgery, I have been: euphoric, ragey, terrified, exuberant, depressed, desperate to be alone, desperate to be surrounded by people, energized, fatigued, and lots of other things. I have also had to balance &lt;em&gt;other people’s&lt;/em&gt; feelings about my cancer. And that is, pardon me, fucking exhausting. I get that you are operating from a place of love and concern, but unless you are an oncologist, you need to back off, now, or risk seriously damaging your relationship with your daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

I really hate that you had to manage other people’s emotions when you were going through so much yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54fz00223579lesbzd8n@published"&gt;Also, one doesn’t have to have had cancer to understand this kind of mom and this kind of fretting. I think it’s fair to say that the Letter Writer is probably what the kids are now calling an “&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/almond-mom"&gt;Almond Mom&lt;/a&gt;”—someone whose identity is really wrapped up in staying healthy (read: thin) and all that it entails, who thinks three almonds make a totally reasonable snack, and who gets really bent out of shape if other people (especially people who are her daughter!) are not following the same program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54md0023357918jzgwcl@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizzie&lt;/strong&gt;: I had not heard of an “Almond Mom” before, but that is quite a coinage. When someone we love gets sick, there is a desire, often unconscious, to make sure we keep the worst at bay. It is natural, it is human, and it also comes very close to blaming a sick person for being sick. You’re not wrong that alcohol is carcinogenic. It is! But there is a fine line between noting that something is a carcinogen and saying it will “trigger” cancer. I say this especially as someone who had a kind of cancer with a huge stigma. You would not believe how many times people asked me if I am a smoker (no, I have a genetic mutation, but even if I had been a pack a day smoker–rude question!).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54st00243579wsohu5ew@published"&gt;Nothing makes a cancer patient feel worse than the implication that they are being cavalier with their health. Tell your daughter that you love her, that her cancer scared you, and that your fear about her mortality has made you phrase some things badly. Apologize, then ask her what you can do to support her. I promise this will be vastly more effective than shame and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s54yj00253579wcpgfv9q@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenée&lt;/strong&gt;: I can’t believe people asked if you smoked! I mean, I can totally understand if they wondered whether you smoked, but to actually ask? Wow.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5s555800263579a4h8hvq4@published"&gt;Anyway, that’s great advice that is hard to follow. But I guess I will add one more little thing: LW, you clearly love your daughter. And you clearly have a strong sense that physical health is precious and important, which tells me you’re someone who is in touch with how valuable life is. So I hope you can take all that and expand it a little to embrace the idea that living a good, enjoyable life—not just surviving for a long time—is also valuable! Your daughter is doing things that bring her pleasure. Might they lead to a shorter life than consuming a strict, no alcohol diet and spending every spare minute doing calisthenics and popping supplements instead of watching TV? Sure. However, maybe the goal is not to live as long as humanly possible, but to live a reasonably long time in a way that’s not defined by restriction. And do you know what else is bad for quality of life? Fighting with your mom. So if you really care about her, drop this topic and make sure conflict with you isn’t a part of her last five, 10,15 or 50 years on &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried to lose weight, you've probably been told that cooking your own meals is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been backed up by a recent study, which found that people who ate home-cooked, minimally processed foods lost twice the weight compared to those who ate mainly ultra-processed, ready-made foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, involved 50 adults who were randomly assigned to eat either a diet high in ultra-processed foods or one with mostly minimally-processed foods. Both diets were designed to meet the UK's &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/"&gt;national dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to Early Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups lost weight, which makes sense as they consumed fewer calories than they usually did. However, the group that consumed mostly minimally processed foods ultimately consumed fewer calories overall – thereby losing more weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also saw slightly greater improvements to other measures of their health, such as having lower fat mass, reduced triglyceride levels (linked to heart health) and fewer cravings for unhealthy foods at the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultra-processed foods group still lost weight and saw some improvements in blood lipids (fat) and blood glucose (sugar), but these changes were generally smaller than those seen in the minimally processed foods group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, this is both an interesting and important piece of research – even though the results are not entirely surprising. In fact, a surprising result is that the consumption of ultra-processed food still resulted in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimally processed diet group consumed fewer calories overall, which would explain why this group lost more weight. But the fact that this group saw greater improvements in other areas of their health highlights how health encompasses far more than calories or a number on the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_118286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118286" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-642x260.jpg" alt="Pizza and processed foods" class="size-medium wp-image-118286" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/02/ProcessedFoods.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-118286" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Processed foods tend to have less fibre, more added fats, sugars and salt. (Anastasiia Krivenok/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why processing matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bad press, &lt;a href="https://www.ift.org/-/media/policy-advocacy/files/ift_spi_white-paper_processed-foods_1023.pdf"&gt;food processing&lt;/a&gt; plays an essential role in food safety and preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much processing a food has undergone seems to be the factor associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231655/"&gt;worse health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. These foods tend to have less fibre, more added fats, sugars and salt. This is because they're designed to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231655/"&gt;tasty and long-lasting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/"&gt;most common definition&lt;/a&gt; of an ultra-processed foods are foods which are industrially produced and which contain extracts of original foods alongside additives and industrial ingredients. Think crisps or frozen ready meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food system in much of the world has become increasingly reliant on ultra-processed foods, with these foods contributing to about half of food intake in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37905428/"&gt;the UK, Europe and the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's clear evidence that high intake of ultra-processed foods is linked with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231655/"&gt;poorer health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="173152" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more calorie-rich, less nutritious foods we consume, the more our health will suffer – as this recent study has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can you work out which foods are classified as "ultra-processed" and which are only "minimally processed"? In short, this depends on how much processing a food product has undergone to be ready for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are industrially formulated products made mostly from ingredients extracted from foods (such as oils, starches and proteins) and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples include: sugary breakfast cereals, flavoured yoghurts with sweeteners and thickeners, soft drinks, instant noodles, packaged biscuits and cakes, mass-produced bread with emulsifiers and reconstituted meat products – such as chicken nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimally processed foods are whole foods that are altered only to make them safer or easier to prepare. Importantly, this processing doesn't change their nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples include: fresh, frozen or bagged vegetables and fruit, plain yoghurt or milk, whole grains (such as oats or brown rice), eggs, fresh or frozen fish, and tinned beans or tomatoes without added sugar or salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150795" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-642x428.jpeg" alt="Foods including meat, eggs, bananas, broccoli, sunflower seeds, beans, lentils, avocado, mushrooms, peanuts and sweat potato" class="size-medium wp-image-150795" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-642x428.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-622x415.jpeg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/FoodsWithVitaminB6.jpeg 724w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150795" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Minimally processed foods are whole foods that are altered only to make them safer or easier to prepare. (fcafotodigital/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Including minimally processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can sometimes feel overwhelming to work out whether a food is ultra-processed or minimally processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advice that is often suggested for working out whether a food is ultra-processed include checking to see if a product contains more than five to ten ingredients and considering if it contains ingredients you wouldn't use at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the number of ingredients, it's also the type of ingredients that matter. Ultra-processed foods often contain added sugars, refined starches, emulsifiers, stabilisers and flavourings that serve cosmetic purposes (such as improving colour, texture or taste), rather than preserving the food's freshness or safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimally processed foods will not contain these types of ingredients, nor will they have as many ingredients on their label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to be aware of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/"&gt;smoked meats&lt;/a&gt;. While this is a common preservation method, most commercially available smoked meats – such as bacon, ham or sausages – are considered ultra-processed because of the curing agents and other additives they contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While plain smoked fish (such as smoked salmon) is still classed as a processed food, it uses fewer curing agents and additives than other smoked meat products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet rich in minimally processed foods usually means more fibre, more nutrients and fewer calories – all of which can support weight and long-term health, as this recent study showed. So if you're keen to include more minimally processed foods in your diet, here are a few tips to help you get more onto your plate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build meals around vegetables, whole grains and pulses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use tinned or frozen products for convenience and to save time while cooking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose plain dairy products without sugar or fruit purees, then add your own fruits, nuts and seeds for flavour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;healthy meals don't have to be complicated. Aim to include a protein source, a wholegrain carbohydrate and plenty of veggies or fruits at each meal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;batch cook meals when you have time and freeze them if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, it's important to point out that there's a distinction between the potential harms of excessive consumption of ultra-processed foods and the essential role processing can play in ensuring food safety, preservation and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important not to panic about enjoying the occasional biscuit or ready meal, and we should avoid demonising convenience foods – especially for those who face barriers such as limited mobility or lack of cooking facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because remember, the group that ate a diet high in ultra-processed foods but met dietary guidelines still lost weight and saw health benefits in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well doesn't mean that you need to completely eliminate ultra-processed foods. But shifting the balance towards eating more minimally processed foods, with more home-cooked meals where possible, is a step in the right direction.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262669/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

They can be a sign of high cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, cholesterol levels are a major risk factor for heart disease, though &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/actual-best-way-measure-risk-201426063.html" data-ylk="slk:a simple blood test is gaining popularity as the key predictor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a simple blood test is gaining popularity as the key predictor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“High cholesterol or high LDL (bad) cholesterol or high triglycerides directly increases your risk of heart disease because high levels of these can lead to a &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/dietary-habit-that-leads-to-plaque-buildup-in-arteries-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:buildup of fatty deposits called plaque on artery walls;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;buildup of fatty deposits called plaque on artery walls&lt;/a&gt;, a process known as atherosclerosis,” explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/faculty-bio/?n=Moore,%20Angela" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Angela Moore, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Angela Moore, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a dermatologist and the associate professor of clinical sciences at Burnett School of Medicine at TCU. “This plaque narrows and hardens arteries, restricting blood flow to the heart and increasing the risk of heart attack and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/why-women-face-78-higher-120000270.html" data-ylk="slk:stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/why-high-cholesterol-isnt-always-bad-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:High Cholesterol Isn’t Always a Sign for Alarm—Here’s Why, According to Cardiologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Cholesterol Isn’t Always a Sign for Alarm—Here’s Why, According to Cardiologists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But back to xanthomas. “Xanthomas are associated with familial hyperlipidemia (genetically related to high cholesterol levels in the blood),” Dr. Arunachalam says. “Subsequently, people can develop conditions such as coronary artery disease or atherosclerotic heart disease, stroke and non-healing leg ulcers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are various kinds of xanthomas too, doctors say. Xanthelasma is the most common; it’s found around the eyelids and is either benign or a sign of high cholesterol. Other types include eruptive xanthomas, tuberous xanthomas, tendinous xanthomas and plane xanthomas. Depending on which one we’re talking about, they can appear on your elbow, palm, joints, tendons, hands or feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not sure if you’re looking at that or something different? You can get a biopsy to rule out skin lesions, Dr. Arunachalam explains, but usually, an experienced clinician and dermatologist will be able to identify the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/common-issue-people-over-50-152500696.html" data-ylk="slk:The Common Issue for People Over 50 That’s a Surprising Sign of Heart Disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Common Issue for People Over 50 That’s a Surprising Sign of Heart Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then, treating the high cholesterol (if present) can prevent new xanthomas and may reduce existing ones, Dr. Moore adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ways to lower cholesterol include &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/one-thing-cardiologist-begging-start-112500786.html" data-ylk="slk:fitting in 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;fitting in 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week&lt;/a&gt; and eating &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/worried-cholesterol-levels-try-incorporating-215159479.html" data-ylk="slk:foods that lower cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;foods that lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, such as oats, salmon, raspberries, dark chocolate, carrots, whole grain bread, extra virgin olive oil, apples, cashews, black beans, green tea and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Other Skin Changes That May Be Linked to Heart Disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to note that xanthomas aren’t the only skin change that can point to a heart issue.

In mice, this mutation reduced sociability and defensive aggression by limiting vasopressin reaching the lateral septum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers showed that vasopressin acts through two distinct receptors: AVPR1a for sociability and AVPR1b for aggression. By selectively targeting AVPR1a, they restored social interaction without triggering unwanted aggressive responses, opening the door to personalized therapies for autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Shank3 mutation reduces vasopressin release in the lateral septum, impairing sociability and aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receptor Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; AVPR1a receptor regulates sociability, while AVPR1b controls aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Selective AVPR1a activation improved social behavior in mice without increasing aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UMH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cognition and Social Interactions laboratory, led by Félix Leroy at the Institute for Neurosciences, a joint center of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the Miguel Hernández University (UMH) of Elche, has identified for the first time the mechanism linking a mutation in the &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; gene with alterations in social behavior. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model carrying this autism-associated mutation, the study shows that vasopressin, a brain hormone essential for social relationships, is not properly released in the lateral septum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that the proper release of vasopressin in this region regulates social behaviors through two distinct receptor pathways: one controlling sociability and the other controlling social aggression, and that selective activation of these receptors can reverse deficits in social interaction without triggering unwanted aggressive responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings provide the first detailed explanation of how a genetic mutation linked to autism leads to problems in social interaction. Until now, the &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; gene had been associated with the disorder, but the biological mechanism underlying this connection remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key, as this study demonstrates, lies in vasopressin: a brain hormone that acts as a messenger between neurons and is essential for regulating sociability and aggression in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that in animals with the mutation, part of the population of vasopressin-releasing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) was lost. In addition, they confirmed that these neurons release vasopressin in the lateral septum. As a result, little vasopressin reached the lateral septum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alteration explains why the mutant mice showed reduced sociability and a marked decrease in defensive aggression, a behavior that, under normal conditions, allows males to defend their territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also shows that vasopressin acts in the lateral septum through two different receptors, each responsible for a specific aspect of behavior: receptor AVPR1a controls sociability, while receptor AVPR1b regulates social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers manipulated these receptors, they were able to restore each behavior independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We managed to improve sociability without increasing aggression, which is fundamental if we are thinking about a future treatment”, explains Leroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the team used a new vasopressin biosensor developed in collaboration with Yulong Li’s laboratory at Peking University. This tool, never before applied to this hormone, made it possible to visualize in real time how vasopressin was released in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to this technology, we were able to demonstrate that the alteration was not present across the entire nervous system, but in a very specific circuit,” emphasizes María Helena Bortolozzo-Gleich, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, collaboration with researchers at the University of Zurich made it possible to validate the reliability of the results through computational data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this research are protected by a patent application aimed at developing drugs capable of selectively activating the AVPR1a receptor, which is responsible for sociability. The goal is to design therapies that improve social deficits in people with autism without inducing side effects related to aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was carried out in male mice because the vasopressin pathway is more developed in males, and only they display the territorial aggression under study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sex difference could help explain, at least in part, why autism is more frequent in males, although it is also possible that in females the disorder manifests differently or is underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that future treatments could be personalized, taking these differences into account,” adds Leroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study has been supported by funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, the CIDEGENT fellowship program of the Generalitat Valenciana, the Severo Ochoa Foundation, and the “la Caixa” Foundation. It was also supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA), the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is part of the &lt;em&gt;MotivatedBehaviors&lt;/em&gt; project (H2020-ERC-STG/0784, n°949652), which aims to study the role of the lateral septum in regulating motivated behaviors to uncover the changes that occur in disorders associated with social behavior deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this line, Leroy has developed extensive expertise in studying this brain region. In 2023, his group published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; a study showing how corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling from the prefrontal cortex to the lateral septum suppresses interaction with familiar individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scientific trajectory has consolidated Leroy as a reference in the field, a recognition further reinforced by the EBBS Mid Career Award, recently granted by the European Brain and Behaviour Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#711016101d1d100331041c195f1402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angeles Gallar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umh.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angeles Gallar – UMH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61994-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impaired vasopressin neuromodulation of the lateral septum leads to social behavior deficits in Shank3B+/- male mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Félix Leroy et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impaired vasopressin neuromodulation of the lateral septum leads to social behavior deficits in Shank3B+/- male mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has been repeatedly associated with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Shank3B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; male mice, a model of ASD, exhibit deficits in sociability and social aggression, we focused on the lateral septum (LS), a brain region involved in the regulation of motivated behaviors and observed reduced AVP inputs from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to LS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manipulating AVP release from the BNST to LS of wild-type male mice, we found that AVP promotes both sociability and social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) in LS impaired sociability, while blocking the receptor 1b (AVPR1b) disrupted social aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, selective activation of AVPR1a or AVPR1b rescued the respective behavioral deficits in &lt;em&gt;Shank3B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal that AVP release in LS modulates two distinct social behaviors via different receptors and highlight a possible strategy to rescue sociability during ASD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:24:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5DNmtqVDYwMmw3aWxCSGxLMVBmNjY5WjNiaEVDLXUwRFZmMnk3d1E2WkpFV0pPb3E4R3NXUDBReTYzcG9xVi1VN0c0bzU0NGVybnE5N1ZFcDU1eGVSQXR6Q05STXlWWkpsUmhXSnp1bU5md3lBaWREbjNwVQ</guid></item><item><title>旧金山猫在食用受禽流感污染的宠物食品后被安乐死- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/sf-cat-food-bird-flu-21030651.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Yet despite an abundance of research, the earliest brain changes that trigger this disease still remain unclear, making it challenging to find effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could lithium – a metal most of us know better for its use in batteries or as a treatment for mood disorders – play a role in cognitive health? &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02471-4"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; shows that this mineral may play a key role in protecting against Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is linked to the buildup of two harmful proteins: amyloid-beta and tau. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3505"&gt;Amyloid-beta&lt;/a&gt; clumps outside brain cells (neurons), forming sticky plaques that block communication. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28386764/#:%7E:text=Tau%20is%20well%20established%20as%20a%20microtubule%2Dassociated%20protein%20in%20neurons.&amp;amp;text=Recent%20advances%20in%20our%20understanding%20of%20the,synaptic%20plasticity%2C%20and%20regulation%20of%20genomic%20stability."&gt;Tau&lt;/a&gt; twists into tangles inside cells, disrupting their structure and function. Together, they damage the delicate network of neurons that supports memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for nearly a decade now, scientists from Harvard University have also been uncovering lithium’s unexpected importance in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium is naturally present in small amounts in the brain. This lithium comes from our diet, where it’s transported through the bloodstream to the brain’s cells. But researchers have found that as people move from &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1533317518791401"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; – a stage often seen as a warning sign for Alzheimer’s – to full Alzheimer’s disease, their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Sec11"&gt;lithium levels drop&lt;/a&gt;. This loss of lithium appears to set off the cascade of changes that lead to memory loss and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Sec11"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; now helps to explain why a loss of lithium is linked with Alzheimer’s disease. The study showed that lithium acts as a natural defender – helping to keep amyloid and tau in check. When lithium levels fall, the brain becomes more vulnerable to these toxic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers uncovered this connection by conducting postmortem examinations of brain tissue taken from people who had been in different stages of cognitive health. Those with mild cognitive impairment had noticeably less lithium in their brains compared to those who had been in good cognitive health. Levels were even lower in Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found that the lithium doesn’t just disappear. Much of it becomes trapped within amyloid plaques, which lock it away from the brain cells where it’s needed most. This means even if total lithium levels don’t drop drastically, brain cells may still be starved of its protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to explore what happens when lithium is missing completely, the scientists then studied mice – both healthy mice and mice that had been genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer’s symptoms. They cut the mice’s dietary lithium by 50% and observed the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects were striking. Mice with reduced lithium showed faster amyloid and tau buildup, more brain inflammation and lost connections between neurons – all crucial for learning and memory. The genetically engineered mice also performed worse in memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this process is an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2860202/"&gt;GSK3β&lt;/a&gt;. Lithium normally keeps this enzyme under control. But when lithium is low, GSK3β becomes overactive, encouraging tau to behave abnormally and form tangles that damage neurons. This enzyme acts like a switch, tipping brain cells toward disease if unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is the study didn’t stop at identifying the problem. Researchers treated mice with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8413749/"&gt;lithium orotate&lt;/a&gt;, a form of the mineral that’s less likely to get trapped by amyloid plaques. This treatment prevented the harmful buildup of amyloid-beta and tau, reduce inflammation, preserved neuron connections and improved memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lithium’s importance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research recasts lithium as more than a forgotten trace mineral. It appears to be a vital guardian of brain health, protecting neurons and maintaining cognitive function throughout life. Disrupting lithium balance might be one of the earliest steps toward Alzheimer’s – even before symptoms show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium’s protective role isn’t entirely new. It’s been used in psychiatry for decades, particularly to manage &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9484534/"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; where it stabilises mood. But medicinal doses are much higher than the tiny amounts naturally present in the brain. This study is the first to reveal that even these small, natural levels have a crucial protective function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Alzheimer’s, lithium supports brain growth, shields nerve cells, and calms inflammation, all important for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10227915/"&gt;healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping lithium levels stable could have wider benefits in preventing dementia and supporting brain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason lithium hasn’t featured prominently in Alzheimer’s research before is its simplicity. It doesn’t target one molecule but acts like a conductor, balancing multiple brain processes. This makes it harder to study but no less important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that lithium deficiency worsens Alzheimer’s damage opens new possibilities. Unlike current treatments focusing on removing amyloid plaques or tau tangles, lithium replacement could boost the brain’s defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium orotate is especially promising because it doesn’t get trapped by amyloid and delivers lithium where neurons most need it. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6643006/"&gt;Lithium salts&lt;/a&gt; have long been used safely in medicine, so this approach could be easy and accessible for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s unclear why lithium levels fall in some people. Is it due to diet, genetics or another cause? Could differences in the natural levels of lithium in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11364728/"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; worldwide influence Alzheimer’s risk? These puzzles invite future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that much of this work was done in mice. While animal models offer valuable insights, human brains are more complex. Clinical trials will be needed to see if lithium orotate can safely prevent or slow Alzheimer’s in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also don’t yet know how supplements or diet might affect brain lithium levels over time, or if this would be practical as treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the idea that a simple mineral could delay or prevent one of the world’s most devastating diseases is both exciting and hopeful.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262880/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262880/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

She revealed that she learned on the third day after Devi’s birth that her daughter was born with two holes in her heart. Bipasha described the experience as far tougher than the smile she now wears and said she wouldn’t wish it on any mother. She shared her story to support other mothers, noting how difficult it was to find guidance and support during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early days were overwhelming&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress further spoke about Devi’s condition, visibly emotional as she spoke. She admitted that neither she nor Karan fully understood what a ventricular septal defect (VSD) was initially. The early days were overwhelming for the couple, leaving them in a blur. While they wanted to celebrate the birth of their daughter, the reality of her heart condition left them feeling numb and unsure of how to process everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also opened up about preparing for Devi’s surgery, revealing that Karan Singh Grover initially struggled to come to terms with it. She shared that the first five months after Devi’s birth were extremely challenging, but praised their daughter’s resilience from day one. Doctors advised monthly scans to monitor if the ventricular septal defect could heal on its own, but given the size of the hole, surgery was deemed inevitable and best performed when Devi was three months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Facing the tough decision&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipasha recalled the third month when they went for Devi’s scan. She shared that she had done extensive research, met surgeons, visited hospitals, and consulted doctors, feeling mentally prepared for the surgery, while Karan was not. She was determined that their daughter would be fine, and thankfully, Devi came through successfully. The most challenging part, she added, was making the decision to operate at the right place and the right time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress also revealed to Neha that Devi’s surgery lasted six hours, and admitted she didn’t sleep for 40 days and 40 nights, emphasizing the emotional toll the period took on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwJBVV95cUxOUk11NVJNc19NZE54bFR0VW1XOHBQWDhtT2tFM0hhVHpPLXN1TmQzdXpIUTJ1a1E2SnNfN29hX1hLUGotR0tWYUVrd1A2RjFIUHhTUjFHa0hIamNXc1BGMUtvcUJCZ05NdjR4aDU2UmdRaDVkbE0yTDZvVlJ6bDdPaDM2YXBTMTBoXzBENGhUMnFObGZkaTkwX1UtSDNoSUozOGJySmJJUkQ4Qi1hWlBzUkxvbzVkMldOaGx1a3ByT09pcFJjeUpiZFR0ay1ucjlSWlZoZ2ZJVjJtVldkRm1hdHllQWJ2MEpqOFZMbFBlX1oxMjJXLUJRTEk3RHBhNnJXTnMzMnRKWjFxSElkWEZuQXdzQjZ2U0FRNWNnTlNFd3lJZXh6bFNyWEdRSVNtNzlEemdnSElkNA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，空气污染会导致毁灭性的痴呆症-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/04/fine-particulate-air-pollution-trigger-forms-dementia-study-lewy-body</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fine-particulate air pollution can drive devastating forms of dementia by triggering the formation of toxic clumps of protein that destroy nerve cells as they spread through the brain, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exposure to the airborne particles causes proteins in the brain to misfold into the clumps, which are hallmarks of Lewy body dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"environment","tags":[{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"society/dementia","type":"Keyword","title":"Dementia"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/iansample","type":"Contributor","title":"Ian Sample","twitterHandle":"iansample","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=8e4848b5cd47215a09f2a5d1f2d4dd9d","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample,_L.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9455f2ae800441cdaea2f1e216d52ea5"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-environment","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Environment"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"environment/2025/sep/04/fine-particulate-air-pollution-trigger-forms-dementia-study-lewy-body","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The finding has “profound implications” for preventing the neurodegenerative disorder, which affects millions worldwide, with scientists calling for a concerted effort to improve air quality by cutting emissions from industrial activity and vehicle exhausts, improving wildfire management and reducing wood burning in homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unlike age or genetics, this is something we can change,” said Dr Xiaobo Mao, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US and the study’s lead investigator. “The most direct implication is that clean air policies are brain health policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers began by analysing hospital records from 56.5 million US patients who were admitted for the first time between 2000 and 2014 with Lewy body-related neurodegenerative disease. Armed with the patients’ zip codes, the scientists estimated their long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution, airborne particles that are smaller than 2.5 thousandths of a millimetre. These can be inhaled deep into the lungs and are found in the bloodstream, brain and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 raised the risk of Lewy body dementia, but had less of an impact on rates of another neurodegenerative brain disease that is not driven by the toxic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lewy bodies are made from a protein called alpha-synuclein. The protein is crucial for healthy brain functioning, but can misfold in various ways to produce different kinds of harmful Lewy bodies. These can kill nerve cells and cause devastating disease by spreading through the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To see if air pollution could trigger Lewy bodies, the team exposed mice to PM2.5 pollution every other day for 10 months. Some were normal mice, but others were genetically modified to prevent them making alpha-synuclein. The results were striking: in normal mice, nerve cells died off, leading to brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. The genetically modified mice were largely unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Further work in mice showed that PM2.5 pollution drove the formation of aggressive, resilient and toxic clumps of alpha-synuclein clumps that looked very similar to Lewy bodies in humans. Although the work is in mice, the findings are considered compelling evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Putting the two together, to me, indicates that there’s a pretty strong association with air pollution causing Lewy body dementia. We think it’s a very important driving factor for dementia,” said Ted Dawson, a senior author on the study and a professor in neurodegenerative diseases at Johns Hopkins. “There needs to be a concerted effort to keep our air clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The work, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu4132" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Science&lt;/a&gt;, builds on previous studies that have found PM2.5s in people’s brains where damage has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/toxic-air-pollution-particles-found-in-human-brains-links-alzheimers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/air-pollution-causes-huge-reduction-in-intelligence-study-reveals" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reductions in intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our findings have profound implications for prevention because they identify air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for Lewy body dementia,” Mao told the Guardian. “By lowering our collective exposure to air pollution, we can potentially reduce the risk of developing these devastating neurodegenerative conditions on a population-wide scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, researchers at University College London and the Francis Crick Institute in London &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/20/does-air-pollution-cause-dementia-uk-scientists-launch-study-to-find-out" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launched a project called Rapid&lt;/a&gt;, for Role of Air Pollution in Dementia, to investigate how the air we breathe may harm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is an important and compelling study that deepens our understanding of how air pollution can drive neurodegenerative disease,” said Prof Charles Swanton, a co-leader of the Rapid project and deputy clinical director at the Crick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By linking fine-particulate matter exposure to the biology of Lewy body dementia, it provides a mechanistic bridge between environmental exposure and disease pathology. More broadly, the work underscores the urgent need to understand and mitigate the impact of air pollution on dementia and disease risk more broadly, given its enormous and growing public health burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNQmhoU0E2MWNxWTJ6ZjVIeTliY25ONzhpNzktam94aVJHa3o1aU5rRkIyMTZiX2Jsd2xVb3ZmZmdrZXVnbHlJMHRKSVlmdFVOcm9WelYwWmRySDBaMVdsekE5b09GT3VEUWlBNVBiNkg3TVNiY0FJYk55ZnkzTnlRb29FWTZBd1VJbkNuS09zaTYycnpoRkJGNG9DOGMxanR6SVVNaTJkS0RpSS1qYjAzQzdSN3Q2VmRHRVh6ZUxn</guid></item><item><title>美国心脏协会发布血压指南改革...对您意味着什么-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15066223/American-Heart-Association-issues-overhaul-blood-pressure-guidelines-means-YOU.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New blood pressure guidelines have been introduced to encourage people to take action earlier on as more young people are being struck by heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the widespread belief that hypertension or high blood pressure is an old-age problem, doctors are increasingly treating younger generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now estimated that about 25 percent of young adults (aged 18 to 39) have hypertension, a reading of anything higher than 130/80 mm Hg, and a notable percentage of children and adolescents (aged eight to 19) are also affected. Meanwhile, half of US adults suffer from high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This condition can lead to serious health complications later in life, such as heart disease and stroke, as well as kidney disease, cognitive decline and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/new-high-blood-pressure-guideline-emphasizes-prevention-early-treatment-to-reduce-cvd-risk"&gt;American Heart Association's&lt;/a&gt; guidelines, which have been revamped for the first time since 2017, there is a greater emphasis on preventative measures to 'address the growing burden of morbidity and mortality attributable to high blood pressure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart specialists have established a tool called PREVENT: Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease events. It is a calculator to estimate 10- and 30-year cardiovascular disease risk in people aged 30 to 79 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It includes variables such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and other health indicators, including zip code as a proxy for social drivers of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measures also provide updated guidance on medication options, including using GLP-1 medications for some patients with high blood pressure who are overweight or obese, and recommendations for managing hypertension, before, during and after pregnancy, as the condition can cause life-threatening complications during these periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New blood pressure guidelines have been introduced to encourage people to take action earlier on as more young people are being struck by heart issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the American Heart Association's PREVENT equation for estimating cardiovascular risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New diet recommendations were also made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to small dietary changes, in adults with or without hypertension, the new guidelines recommend potassium-based salt substitutes over traditional table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cardiologists note that this can be useful to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure and hypertension, 'particularly for patients in whom salt intake is related mostly to food preparation or flavoring at home'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults are advised to limit their sodium intake to less than 2,300mg per day, moving toward an ideal limit of 1,500mg per day, by checking food labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at diets as a whole, the heart health experts recommend the DASH diet, which emphasizes reduced sodium intake and a diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and low-fat or nonfat dairy, and includes lean meats and poultry, fish and non-tropical oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, concerning alcohol consumption, the guidelines recommend consuming no alcohol or for those who choose to drink, consuming no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other pointers in the guidelines to prevent the risk of high blood pressure include managing stress with exercise, as well as incorporating stress-reduction techniques like meditation, breathing control or yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also advised to maintain a healthy weight, and increase physical activity to at least 75 to 150 minutes each week, including cardio and weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heart specialists have established a PREVENT (Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease EVENTs) risk calculator to estimate cardiovascular disease risk in people aged 30 to 79 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the change in hypertension prevalence among all American adults, as well as among men and women from 1999 to 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 CDC report found 47.7 percent of adults 18 and older had hypertension between 2020 and 2023, which is about the same as the prevalence in the CDC's report from 2017-2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, four in 10 adults of that percentage don't know they have the condition, the CDC said, meaning they are not receiving treatment and are therefore at much higher risk of deadly complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is a primary or contributing factor in more than 685,000 deaths each year in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings mean the government is on track to fail in its goal to bring hypertension prevalence down to 41 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence among men remained mostly unchanged from survey-to-survey and women's prevalence dropped by about one percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And between the sexes, the 2024 CDC report showed that men had a higher prevalence than women - 50.8 percent compared to 44.6 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People 18 to 39 years old had a prevalence of 23 percent. Prevalence was about 53 percent in people 40 to 59 years old and it was 72 percent in Americans 60 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphs show all cardiovascular disease risk (top), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (center) and heart failure risk (bottom) for men (right) and women (left) based on how many risk factors, which include blood pressure, medication regimen, smoking status, cholesterol level and diabetes status, a person has&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While prevalence slightly decreased in the older age groups, younger age groups saw a slight rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This slight increase could be a contributing factor to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13451921/strokes-rate-surge-young-people-cdc.html"&gt; the rise in strokes and cardiac events among young people&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strokes in Americans under 45 have risen nearly 15 percent since 2011, according to a separate report from the CDC.  The agency partly attributed the rise to an increase in high blood pressure, but also to an increase in nationwide obesity and drug addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cleveland Clinic lists recreational drug use, an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle a risk factors for hypertension. However, healthy and active people are not immune to hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newest CDC 2024 report found, among people with hypertension, 59 percent were aware they had the condition and about half were taking medication to lower their blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this varied widely across age groups. Just 27 percent of 18- to 39-year-olds were aware they were suffering from hypertension, compared to the 74 percent of people 60 and older who were aware of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, treatment also varied. Just 14 percent of younger people were treating their hypertension compared to 69 percent of seniors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the level of treatment, however, just 21 percent of all people had their blood pressure controlled to a healthy level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2024 CDC report found 47.7 percent of adults 18 and older had hypertension between 2020 and 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows hypertension prevalence in counties across the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was no significant change in the percent of people who were aware of, in treatment for or in control of their hypertension observed from the 2017-2021 survey and 2021-2023 survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, hypertension does not cause symptoms, which is why doctors call it a 'silent killer,' according to the Cleveland Clinic, but when blood pressure is higher than 180/120 mmHg - considered a medical emergency called a hypertensive crisis - a person may experience headaches, heart palpitations and nosebleeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, high blood pressure was the primary contributor to approximately 685,900 deaths in the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, high blood pressure can weaken the heart and blood vessels, which can cause cardiovascular disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13154677/young-people-having-heart-attacks-lead-seemingly-healthy-lifestyles-suffered-heart-problems.html"&gt;including sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;, and increase risk for stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat hypertension, doctors will recommend lifestyle changes, such as reaching and remaining at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, limiting alcohol, exercising and making sure to consume enough potassium, a mineral and electrolyte involved in important body processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

His dad died suddenly of a stroke, and not long after, his mom was diagnosed with dementia. It shook him. He started taking better care of himself and signed up for a whole-body MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full-body scans are on the rise – attracting celebrity promoters, tech mogul investors, and waiting lists of people hoping to identify life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend told me about &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com"&gt;Prenuvo&lt;/a&gt;, a company founded in 2018 that offers radiation-free MRI scans designed to detect hundreds of conditions and cancers. He said the process was simple: he booked the scan, spent an hour at the clinic, and within days, results were waiting in his inbox. His experience got me curious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prenuvo doesn’t have any clinics in Idaho, so when I found myself in Phoenix recently, I decided to try it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process was simple. I booked an appointment online, filled out a detailed health history, and fasted for a few hours before the appointment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d never had an MRI before, and to be honest, I was somewhat nervous. I get claustrophobic, and as the table slid me into the machine, I felt my chest tighten. However, Prenuvo has a nice solution: patients can watch Netflix during the scan using special glasses and headphones. It was surprisingly calming — I actually got caught up on a show I’d been meaning to watch, and it helped the time go quickly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table.jpg" alt="nate on table" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-775301" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-300x169.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-768x432.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-860x484.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-889x500.jpg 889w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nate-on-table-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;EastIdahoNews.com reporter Nate Eaton prepares for his MRI. | Jordan Wood, EastIdahoNews.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The scan itself took about an hour. Between the machine’s beeps, thumps, and taps, the technician guided me through everything via headset, even reminding me when to hold my breath. I always had a “panic button” in my hand if I needed to get out, which helped me relax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it was over, I changed back into my clothes, grabbed a few snacks waiting outside the room, and went on with my day. Three days later, the results were ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I logged into the Prenuvo site and scheduled a 40-minute virtual appointment with Dr. Vikash Modi, their Senior Medical Director of Preventive Medicine. He walked me through every detail. The scan picked up a small cyst on my kidney and liver — both benign and nothing to worry about — but otherwise, everything looked good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst.jpg" alt="kidney cyst Nate Eaton" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-775298" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-300x196.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-768x501.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-860x561.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-767x500.jpg 767w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kidney-cyst-600x391.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A small cyst was found on Nate Eaton’s left kidney during his MRI. | Prenuvo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Modi made it clear that Prenuvo isn’t a replacement for certain screenings, like colonoscopies, and it can’t detect calcium deposits in the heart’s arteries and veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some physicians &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/18/nx-s1-5009259/full-body-scan-mri-prevention-cancer-screening"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; whether expensive full-body MRIs are necessary for people without symptoms, pointing out risks like false positives, unnecessary follow-up tests, and limited data proving the scans extend life. Prenuvo has also faced legal challenges in the past, such as a lawsuit claiming a radiologist missed signs of a stroke on a scan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That being said, I now feel more aware of my health — and more motivated to keep making good choices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prevuno has clinics across the country. You can find locations &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/locations"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

However, each lab studied this question in different mice's brains, and performed slightly different behavioral tasks with each set of rodents. Once you added in uncertainties around how each research group defined distinct regions within the brain, these inconsistencies muddied the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wouldn't know whether we actually agree or disagree, because so many things were different," Carandini told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/most-detailed-human-brain-map-ever-contains-3300-cell-types" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/most-detailed-human-brain-map-ever-contains-3300-cell-types"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most detailed human brain map ever contains 3,300 cell types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZXewFsX2meZaxAmQazVt6i" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZXewFsX2meZaxAmQazVt6i slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the IBL came together to design a single, robust, standardized experiment on a scale that no individual lab could tackle alone. They then paired this megatest with precision brain measuring tools and preset analysis methods to make the results as reproducible as possible. The aim of the experiment would be to overcome an enduring obstacle in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the longest-standing challenges in neuroscience is to decipher how variation in neural systems — both structural and functional — maps onto variation in behavior," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/federico-turkheimer" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/federico-turkheimer" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Federico Turkheimer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at King's College London who was not involved in the study, said in a statement to the U.K. Science Media Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project ultimately included 139 mice, spread across 12 labs around the world, that were implanted with brain-recording devices called Neuropixels probes. The probes can record up to 1,000 individual neurons simultaneously. The researchers tested the mice with a simple behavioral task that each of the dozen labs could reliably replicate: Researchers placed mice in front of a screen, and a black-and-white striped marker would flash either on the right or left. If the mice moved a small wheel in the same direction as the flash, they received a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what you'd read in a neuroscience textbook, said Carandini, you'd expect the brain activity that occurred during the experiment to follow a linear path. First, cells in the visual cortex that recognize images would fire up, followed by neurons in a different part of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex, known to be involved in abstract decisions. This information might then be combined with additional activity that represented the mouse's prior experiences — in other words, memories — before being sent to motor regions of the brain that control muscle responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="2a0476d9-8c5c-4d58-b04c-d6ab6d1d520c"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The studies included data from more than 600,000 brain cells across 139 mice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Dan Birman, International Brain Laboratory)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="9f964cb6-8fb3-4fff-bcd1-cb250703e96c"&gt;The researchers' findings supported some of this chain reaction; the visual cortex was the first thing to activate, for example. Yet other findings clashed with the team's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found decision signals and signals related to the prior information in way more brain regions than we might have thought," Carandini said. Taken together, the activity across nearly all of the brain regions studied could be used to deduce whether or not the mouse had received a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some of the experimental trials, the researchers made the on-screen marker incredibly faint, so the mice essentially had to guess which way to move the wheel. The second Nature paper focused on how the mice used prior expectations — based on where the marker had been in previous tests — to inform their guess. The brain activity that flashed up when the mice guessed in these tasks was also far more widely distributed in the brain than the team anticipated it would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBL modeled its approach to understanding the brain on similar initiatives, such as the particle physics experiments conducted at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/cern" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/cern"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CERN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/complete-gapless-human-genome-sequenced" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/complete-gapless-human-genome-sequenced"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Human Genome Project's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; work to understand our DNA. To describe the project's impact, Carandini reaches for yet another field: astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="515793c1-b40c-47c0-a815-e4f99f1ca98f"&gt;He noted that the earliest astronomers could look up at the night sky and see every star, but in very poor detail. With the advent of the telescope, individual celestial bodies could be explored. Previous work in neuroscience, he said, was "as if somebody had pointed a telescope only to one galaxy, and then different astronomers had pointed their telescopes at different galaxies, and said, 'My galaxy does this!' or 'No, my galaxy does that!" The new project, he explained, was like being able to view all the features of the night sky at once and up close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such work has only been possible with recent technological advances and improved collaboration across labs, but Carandini hopes that it can now be used to address other big questions about the brain. The current paper's findings are only correlational, so it is currently not possible to say whether the observed brain activity directly causes a decision to be made or is only associated with the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's the next frontier," he said, "is to add causality to the study."&lt;/p&gt;

She grew up as the eldest child in an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/i-got-all-of-my-dating-advice-from-my-evangelical-church.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;evangelical Christian family&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a mother who was often bed-bound due to health problems and a father who worked long hours outside of the house. Jordan took on child care, laundry, and other parental duties starting at age 7. She also served as her parents’ confidante, constantly kept abreast of their financial and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/couples-therapists.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;marital woes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. By the time she was a teenager, she had &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/adult-friendships-vs-kids.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lost all interest in ever becoming a parent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “I’d seen what that responsibility looks like and how it could consume your whole identity,” the 39-year-old says. She envisioned her adult life as child free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blake had grown up with a career-driven mom, and hearing about his childhood, Jordan started to envision a different model of motherhood. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jd5rd001c3b78vudyj0i5@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“All the men I had grown up with had very limited views of what women’s roles were supposed to be, and here was this guy who had grown up admiring a mom who was at the top of her field,” says Jordan, who has two graduate degrees and works for a startup in Boston. “I had this sense of, &lt;/em&gt;I’m going to be supported for who I am, who I want to be, and I how I want to grow with this guy.&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Several years later, after copious journaling, reading, therapy sessions, and consultations with friends, Jordan decided she was ready to start trying. “I decided I didn’t want fear to hold me back from something that could open up my life,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She and Blake had long been candid about their sexual fantasies about other people, so Jordan said, “What if we actually tried this for real?” Blake was “immediately game,” Jordan remembers. They started seeing other people together — going to sex parties where they’d swing or have a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/how-to-arrange-three-way-with-husband.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;threesome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a woman or nonbinary person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was really hot and we were both really into it,” Jordan says. “We even framed it as: This is our last hurrah before we have kids. Let’s go wild and crazy.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it shifted for me when I realized, &lt;em&gt;I’m interested in women separate and apart from my relationship with my husband&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

With men, I’d always needed to feel smaller to feel sexy, but with her, I was taller and I was attracted to that dynamic. That was a lightbulb moment. I thought, &lt;em&gt;I would want to hook up with her regardless, not just because we’re in this sexy circumstance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000o0ihqk3hxdz5u@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;When I told Blake I was bi, I thought I was taking this awareness in one area of my life and integrating it — making it more meaningful and giving it more texture. I thought I was strengthening our relationship by being vulnerable with him. But he was immediately fearful. He even said, “We’re going to get divorced over this.” That was really hard to hear. I felt betrayed. I had tried to be honest, but was met with fear and anger. I left for the weekend to stay with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

He apologized and framed his response as an initial reaction that he wasn’t standing by. He said he was very supportive. So we resumed going to these parties and working through my sexuality as something that was going to be part of our lives that we’d figure out together.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jbihx000q0ihqlf1uncm1@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;About a year after I came out to Blake, I told him I was interested in dating other people — but now without him involved. He said he was as well. So we set boundaries: We could see people multiple times, but it was supposed to be casual — we weren’t supposed to be falling in love with other people or developing emotional attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600243b78oi45ho26@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;On my first date with a woman, Nora, I remember feeling nervous and hyperaware of my body. I felt very locked in with her in terms of our eye contact and easy conversation. I walked her to the train afterwards and I was like, &lt;em&gt;How do I say good-bye? &lt;/em&gt;We had a quick kiss. It was the beginning of the summer. Soon we had that new-relationship energy and I wanted to see her all of the time. I started falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600253b786ffix028@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;But that fall, Blake and I also started to try to conceive. We thought: &lt;em&gt;We’re both done with grad school, we both have good jobs, and we’re both in our mid-30s. &lt;/em&gt;We also both wanted two kids, so timing-wise, I felt like, &lt;em&gt;I need to get pregnant tomorrow.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jeem600263b78pie2alcf@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;I knew our sex life was in a tricky stage, but we had figured out hard things before. We’d been through moves and a parent’s death and had a good track record of managing all of that. After a few months of failed attempts, I felt my conviction to become a mother intensify. Getting my period made me really sad. I realized there had been an energetic shift within me — I’d moved away from ambivalence about parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jep5g002j3b78cfdjpf4z@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;I was in a Pilates class when I heard a little voice within me say, “It’s time to go on an adventure.” So on some level I wasn’t surprised when, later that day, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I had this sense that &lt;em&gt;This is right where I want to be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfj7q003l3b78hxow0tnc@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;Blake was over the moon. He insisted on coming with me to the first appointment to confirm the pregnancy. The doctor said, “Oh, there’s two little people in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfj7q003m3b78ehtisffw@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;I was shocked but also not shocked. One of my big fears around pregnancy had been feeling like I was in &lt;em&gt;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&lt;/em&gt; — the body-horror aspect&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Blake had always joked that he hoped I would get pregnant with twins because he wasn’t sure he’d be able to convince me to get pregnant a second time. So my first reaction was, “You manifested this.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jevvl00303b78wtsu13cb@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;Blake and I closed our relationship during the pregnancy. I had been very honest with Nora that I was going to try to get pregnant in the fall and that Blake wasn’t supportive of how emotional our relationship had become, so she wasn’t surprised when I ended things. I didn’t let myself feel too upset about it. I just put it in the&lt;em&gt; this-is-how-it-was-always-supposed-to-be&lt;/em&gt; box.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003v3b78kyrsr55u@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;I had a dream pregnancy. I had a little nausea, but not bad. I got tired more easily, but also had an ideal work-from-home situation, so it wasn’t a problem. And even though the pregnancy was high risk because of the twins and my age, it never felt stressful because I had amazing medical care through my tech job. I’d been worried I was going to feel invaded by the pregnancy, but instead I felt connected to the babies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003w3b78ye98y6bl@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;Meanwhile, Blake and I started trying to understand and digest what my relationship with Nora had meant and how we were going to move on and figure out the rules post-pregnancy. He’d told me about a few of the women he’d enjoyed dating, but he hadn’t fallen in love like I had.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jfwl7003x3b78w6mgl05h@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;I also wasn’t feeling very sexual, so sex wasn’t an aspect of our relationship at that point. We thought, &lt;em&gt;Let’s just focus on the pregnancy and the nesting and the excitement.&lt;/em&gt; Our relationship was good, but there was an elephant in the room.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jg58800443b78phqz6144@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;During a doctor’s appointment at 34 weeks, the doctors found that one of the twins wasn’t growing anymore, and sent me to the hospital to receive the first of two steroid shots. The next day I returned for the second shot and they found I was showing signs of preeclampsia — and they wouldn’t let me go home. So all of a sudden it was like, “You’re having the babies tomorrow.” When Blake and I woke up the next morning in my hospital room (he slept on a pull-out chair bed), we sang to the babies together so they could hear our voices. It was sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgbkv004b3b78pca5hot2@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;The doctor pronounced my C-section “textbook.” Giving birth was very surreal. Everything was super-smooth and the babies were healthy but very small, so they were whisked away immediately for tests before I could even hold them. An hour or so later, before I’d even had a meal, the clinicians wheeled a breast pump into my hospital room. I felt like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’m just a mammal.&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t even get to hold both of them the first night because they needed to be in an incubator. It felt like I wasn’t in charge — it was the NICU nurses who were calling the shots, and I didn’t mind that so much, but in retrospect, I was a little bit sad about it. But I was sad about everything for a while because one baby came home a couple of days before the other baby. When one was in the NICU and one was home, I was just a mess.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgnvb004o3b78deg7keqp@published" data-word-count="205"&gt;In the initial weeks after they were born, it was all hands on deck — figuring out sleep and feeding schedules and getting help. It was very hard for me to bond with the twins, because I was tied to a very grueling schedule: pumping and then feeding one (with a mix of breast milk and formula, as suggested by our pediatrician) and then feeding the other (with that same mix) and then pumping again. I’d put them down to sleep and start all over. It was a blur and felt very mechanical. Plus, about six weeks into my leave, I got laid off. I had guessed that it was coming — my company had recently been acquired — and in a way, it was a good thing, because I had been itching to leave this job for a while and had only stayed because I had great health insurance. I was worried about finding a new job as a mom, but I’m also accustomed to this kind of thing. I’m an elder millennial who entered the workforce in a recession. And most importantly, I was able to negotiate a good severance package: an additional four months of pay on top of my maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgtet004v3b78m2sxra7t@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;Blake was incredibly supportive through that whole process, encouraging me to find a new job that I’d like better than the old one that I’d outgrown. Our strength as a couple was figuring out all of these logistics. It was easy for us to do that and not really emotionally connect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgteu004w3b78w9t0sut5@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;About three months after the twins were born, Blake returned to work and I stopped pumping. That’s when my schedule finally opened up and I was able to spend more relaxed time with the twins. I started taking them on long walks and meeting up with other moms. That felt really good, and it boosted my confidence. I was starting to bond with the twins at that point — just by being able to hold them and snuggle them more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jgteu004x3b78pymqtiot@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;Blake and I also stayed very focused on seeing friends and family. One of my favorite memories is hosting Thanksgiving that first year with longtime friends. It was the first time we had hosted that holiday rather than being guests. It felt like we were establishing our own family traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhcwr005a3b784pky0o6u@published" data-word-count="135"&gt;When the twins were 8 or 9 months old, we visited my parents. Blake and I had always agreed that I was never going to come out to my family or his family. He also had a Christian upbringing. But during this particular visit, I was struck by the fact that being closeted with my family meant I couldn’t truly be out to my kids. And if I was closeted to them, what would that mean if they ever wanted to come out themselves? I felt like a hypocrite — hiding myself but expecting my children to be comfortable with whomever they turned out to be. Simultaneously, I had the realization that I couldn’t be honest with Blake about how I was feeling since he’d always been adamant that my sexuality should be a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj77005h3b78cakzu1f2@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;I really started feeling this alarm in my head going off all the time. Whenever I had a moment where I wasn’t taking care of my kids or trying to find a job or actively busy, my inner self was a five-alarm fire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj77005i3b78foevjtlm@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;I tried to have conversations with Blake, but he resisted acknowledging that we were in a crisis. After a couple months, I said, “I don’t quite know what to do here. I feel like I have to start to consider divorce.” That got his attention. We both started doing individual therapy and couples therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4jhj78005j3b78igq6h751@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;Our biggest issue was my bisexuality: Blake didn’t think it was possible for me to come out to our families without &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; outing us as nonmonogamous. He knew they viewed that as very taboo, and he wasn’t willing to have that confrontation. That felt invalidating to me. Our inability to be vulnerable and emotionally connect in this one area kind of spread throughout the whole relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

It was heartbreaking, but we finally decided that we weren’t going to be able to figure it out. We needed to get divorced.&lt;/p&gt;

They didn’t acknowledge the divorce. I felt isolated and unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;

I came out to them as bisexual and said I needed a break from talking to them so they could digest the news. Three months later, I got on a video call with my parents and siblings. They said they love me even though they don’t agree with my “lifestyle.” In other words, they still think I’m going to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, my parents haven’t tried to reach out to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmf4ji95g006i3b787251vpc3@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;About three months after deciding to divorce, Blake and I found a second apartment. We started bird-nesting right away, which is a way of co-parenting where the kids stay in the same home all the time and the parents switch back and forth between the two homes they share. It was really disorienting at first. I would jerk awake not sure where I was, thinking I was hearing my kids crying even when they weren’t there.&lt;/p&gt;

But I did reach out to another woman I’d dated around the same time. We are now in an open relationship, and I’m deeply in love with her. I’m not dating other people right now because there’s a lot on my plate, but I don’t necessarily see myself being in a monogamous relationship ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

I had always had these emotionally rich, intimate relationships with women. And I also always thought that everyone just acknowledged that women were more beautiful than men. In retrospect, maybe I should have put those two pieces together earlier. But because of how I was raised and how early I got together with Blake, I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven’t introduced them to my girlfriend, who I’ve been with for a little over a year, because I want to take things slow on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

It hasn’t always been easy, but we’ve put our ability to handle difficult situations and be on the same team to use. Our bird-nesting arrangement is still going strong. We’re embedded in each other’s day-to-day lives in terms of groceries and laundry and rent pay. Our custody is 50-50 too. He is a wonderful dad and a really good co-parent, even though we parent differently. I really hope he’s happy romantically, but he keeps that information to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

I was &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/the-evangelical-obsession-with-corporal-punishment.html"&gt;spanked regularly as a child&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m definitely not doing any physical correction with my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was growing up, I felt I couldn’t reveal anything I was struggling with. And when I did, it became a running joke in the family. I got a lot of messages very early on that my emotional interior state was not something that there was space for. So I’m really trying to give space for what my kids feel. Toddlers have a lot of big feelings. My mantra with them is: Be brave, be curious, and be kind. When I see that behavior in them, I try to point it out.&lt;/p&gt;

I want them to know they can be exactly who they are. I also have gratitude for them. Coming out to my family was something I did for my kids — I never would have done it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s surprising and humbling how much you can communicate with a little nonverbal creature. The bond that I was afraid wouldn’t develop actually did without me having to force it.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is reportedly planning to add seven new members to the Centers for Disease Control’s vaccine advisory panel, including known vaccine skeptics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, physician and writer Jeremy Faust &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-rfk-jr-seeks-to-rush-7-new"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; the list of potential new members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, in his newsletter, Inside Medicine, with other sources seeming to confirm its authenticity. Among the names on the list are several researchers and clinicians who have misrepresented the scientific consensus around vaccinations, or otherwise questioned their use. The panel’s purpose is to act as an independent adviser to the CDC, and its recommendations help steer vaccine policy, as well as insurance coverage for jabs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;News of the list comes after Kennedy fired the panel’s members in June and installed his own picks, causing concern among public health experts and lawmakers alike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a hearing in front of the Senate Finance Committee Thursday, Kennedy deflected criticisms of his ACIP picks. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) noted that several of Kennedy’s current ACIP members have received money from testifying in vaccine-related lawsuits. Cassidy argued that this history constituted a financial conflict of interest—the same rationale Kennedy used to dismiss the old ACIP members. Kennedy disagreed entirely, instead claiming that someone being paid to testify against vaccines was merely evidence of them potentially having a bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s first vaccine target&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early June, Kennedy unilaterally fired all 17 ACIP members, citing conflicts of interest despite significant vetting and disclosure processes. He then quickly restocked the panel with several ideological allies, some of whom have a record of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; vaccine safety by citing widely criticized research, or who have &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/fda/two-of-kennedys-new-acip-picks-were-paid-expert-witnesses-in-merck-vaccine-cases"&gt;financially benefited&lt;/a&gt; from testifying against vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later that month, the new but still short-staffed ACIP &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; the removal of an additive called thimerosal that contains mercury from the very few remaining vaccines that contain it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccination proponents have long blamed thimerosal in vaccines for causing autism and neurological problems, but a mountain of studies over the past two decades have failed to find any such connection, and it is widely considered to be safe. Regardless, Kennedy and the HHS &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/thimerosal-mercury-removed-from-us-flu-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; the panel’s recommendation in July.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Stacking the deck&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, Kennedy appears to have picked who will fill the remaining seats on the panel. At least half of the reported new selections appear to have some bias against at least one vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the names on the list is Joseph Fraiman. An emergency medicine specialist in New Orleans, he has authored &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X22010283?via%3Dihub"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.18.25329352v1"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; claiming to show the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines caused more serious adverse effects than commonly believed. At an event led by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in late 2022, Fraiman even &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2022/12/scicheck-desantis-dubious-covid-19-vaccine-claims/"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID-19 vaccines were not safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, many other scientists have &lt;a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/67E0F21A314339B377BB5DC412A4A8"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; Fraiman’s research and methodology, and the vast majority of studies have reaffirmed the safety and life-saving benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another person on the list is pediatric cardiologist Kirk Milhoan, who has also attacked the COVID-19 vaccines and testified in a 2024 congressional hearing on vaccine injuries &lt;a href="https://greene.house.gov/forms/form/?ID=60"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Milhoan’s also a senior fellow at Independent Medical Alliance, a group that has &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fringe-doctors-groups-promote-ivermectin-for-covid-despite-a-lack-of-evidence/"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; dubious treatments for the coronavirus and questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Also named is John Gaitanis, a pediatric neurologist who has &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-cofc-1_19-vv-00795/pdf/USCOURTS-cofc-1_19-vv-00795-0.pdf"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; as an paid expert witness in a specialized federal vaccine court on behalf of people who believe they or their children were harmed by vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so is Catherine Stein, a tuberculosis expert at Case Western Reserve University who &lt;a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/university-vaccine-mandates-must-end-now/"&gt;previously called&lt;/a&gt; for an end to COVID-19 vaccine mandates at universities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy also seems to have tried eliminating pro-vaccine voices from elsewhere in the government.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, a former ACIP member, and outspoken Kennedy critic, was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/02/health/offit-fda-vrbpac"&gt;reportedly barred&lt;/a&gt; from further participation on the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biologics Products Advisory Committee. Offit claims he was offered an extension of his current term by FDA officials until 2027, but that this extension was overturned by HHS without any explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grim outlook ahead&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ACIP is set to meet later this month, when it is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/acip-review-covid-hep-b-and-mmrv-vaccine-recommendations-september-meeting"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to weigh in on several issues that could have widespread implications for vaccine access moving forward. The panel will discuss and potentially offer recommendations on the COVID-19 vaccines, the hepatitis B vaccine, and the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Several members of Congress have called for the meeting to be delayed, including GOP members &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures"&gt;previously supportive&lt;/a&gt; of Kennedy’s nomination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, it takes months of vetting before prospective new members are formally added to the ACIP, so it’s not clear whether the people on the possible additions list will be part of that meeting. It’s also unclear whether the vetting and disclosure process for ACIP members will change as a result of these moves, or how it might affect vaccine policy more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the Senate hearing on Thursday, Sen. Cassidy said Kennedy appeared to be disrupting access to vaccines through his actions as health secretary—an accusation Kennedy denied. The health secretary also repeatedly criticized the CDC for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Kennedy seems as committed as ever to pushing forward his agenda, even as his decisions &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819"&gt;fueled the collapse&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s senior leadership last week. And without a drastic change of course, it seems unlikely that Kennedy and the new ACIP will be deterred.&lt;/p&gt;

And nearly 18million use it daily or near daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But because marijuana boosts levels of certain enzymes in the liver, those who take the drug regularly may also break down anesthetics, both the kind used for sedation during medical treatments and over-the-counter painkillers, much faster, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana also interferes with the same system in the brain as anesthetics, which can also make the sedation-inducing drugs less effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the drugs are less effective, people could wake up during surgery, which poses dangers because it could prompt muscles to move suddenly, increasing the risk of injury, and cause psychological distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest marijuana users may need up to 10 times more anesthetics than people who do not take the drug in order to ensure that their anesthetics are effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above picture shows a woman receiving anesthetic in a hospital (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors urge patients to alert their physicians whether they smoke, vape, or consume marijuana as edibles, since all can affect their response to anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who have previously woken up during surgery have described it as 'terrifying' and causing them significant distress from seeing their body cut open, leading to regular nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But patients do not experience pain, reports suggest, with their nerves still remaining numbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sood shared the advice online in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorsood/video/7543620531510054157"&gt;clip on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; that has gone viral and received 2.1million views and more than 185,000 likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It showed the Maryland physician with the phrase across the top of the video: 'Did you know if you do cannabis long-term you will require a higher dose of anesthesia to achieve the same effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Make sure you tell your anesthesiologist if you smoke or consume cannabis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were quick to respond to the post, with many praising the doctor for raising awareness and some self-described marijuana smokers saying they had woken up during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient wrote, 'Yup, woke up during my colonoscopy [due to this]. Horrible feeling.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors said edibles posed the greatest risk to patients because their effects are longer lasting (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several also said they had woken up during wisdom teeth removals, which they thought was due to their cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some patients also said they had told their doctor about their marijuana use but had been told 'not to worry'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'I told them that before surgery and they said that's not real', while a second said, 'I&lt;span&gt; asked my anesthesiologist before my surgery. He told me I watch too much TV and to not be worried'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kunal Sood, pictured, raised awareness over the complication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that edibles have the greatest effect on anesthetics because these are longer-lasting and can be released from the intestines for hours after consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect of marijuana that is smoked or vaped typically lasts just one to three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are also advised to tell doctors the strength of the marijuana's THC, the ingredient in the drug that produces the high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians will not judge patients for cannabis use, the society said, and will not share the information outside of their medical team. It will only be used to ensure a patient receives the right amount of anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alerting doctors to this would ensure patients avoid unintended hospital admissions after surgery, longer hospital stays or readmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is not clear how many patients wake up during surgery in the US due to marijuana, but it may be in the thousands, with between 40 and 50million surgeries completed in the country every year. And 17.7million Americans describe themselves as habitual pot users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2020/10/cannabis-and-postoperative-pain"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that people who used marijuana before surgery required 50 percent more anesthetic than those who did not use the drug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/marijuana-and-anesthesia-why-tell-your-doctor-about-your-use/"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have even suggested marijuana users may need up to 10 times more anesthetics than other patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows how cannabis use has risen among 19-to-30-year-olds and older adults as more states have legalized the drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Jiff Zafar, an anesthesiologist at Yale, said previously on the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/what-to-tell-your-anesthesiologist-before-surgery"&gt;Yale University website&lt;/a&gt;: 'We want patients to tell us what form of marijuana, and how much, they are using, so we can understand the potency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This is important because it can affect how well the anesthesia works. You may actually have more of a tolerance to anesthesia, which means you need more of it.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The American Society of Anesthesiologists tells people to avoid marijuana from midnight the day before surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They warn the drug can raise heart rate and blood pressure, putting further strain onto the cardiovascular system alongside anesthetics that can cause a surgery-related heart attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After surgery, the experts also recommended that people avoid the drug to ensure they recover correctly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The 59-year-old Melville, New York, resident knew he faced a higher risk of heart disease because of blood pressure that remained high despite medications and a family history of cardiac problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malin thought he’d covered all the bases. But at a visit with his primary care doctor in early 2023, the grandfather of one mentioned a new development — dull, come-and-go pain in his left shoulder and arm when exercising. He soon found himself getting an electrocardiogram (EKG) to gauge his heart’s electrical activity and an exercise stress test with nuclear imaging. &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Northwell Health&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Jeffrey Kuvin, M.D., looked at Malin’s risk factors, symptoms and test results and quickly set up a coronary angiogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A window into a widowmaker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results made the scope of Malin’s heart problem stunningly clear: He had a 99% blockage of his left anterior descending (LAD) artery. A heart attack originating in the LAD is sometimes called a &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/widow-maker-heart-attack-treated-with-therox" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“widowmaker”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“widowmaker”&lt;/a&gt; because the artery plays such a key role in supplying blood to the heart. The interventional cardiology team fixed the problem on the spot, inserting a mesh stent in Malin’s LAD to prop it open. Six hours later, Malin went home, healthy, grateful and ready to adopt the medications and lifestyle changes his doctors advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got pictures of my heart that clearly show the before and the after,” says Malin. “It’s very alarming how close I was to a tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was able to avoid a major — and perhaps life-ending — heart attack,” agrees Dr. Kuvin, senior vice president of cardiology at Northwell Health and co-director of the Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital at North Shore University Hospital. “It speaks to the importance of picking the right test for the right patient at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Communication points the way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when it comes to a heart check-up, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all checklist. The most crucial factor is a frank conversation with your care provider. “There are a number of factors that go into choosing the appropriate tests,” explains Dr. Kuvin, who is the health system's Lorinda and Vincent de Roulet Professor of Medicine. “Everyone’s on their own path, and the clinician’s analysis can determine whether certain tests might be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Difference-making cardiac tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the tests your doctor might recommend — and how can they help you stay healthy? Here are some examples, and what they can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cardiac MRI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; To get detailed information about your heart function, including the texture of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll lie on a platform that slides into an MRI machine. Often, dye is injected through an IV to help produce refined images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; The size of the heart and its pumping power, damage or scarring from a previous heart attack or disease, heart valve function and other cardiac conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chest x-ray&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You need a baseline test or you have chest pain and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; While standing, you’ll be positioned between an X-ray machine and a plate that creates an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; “It provides a good view of the entire chest cavity and can give us information about the size of the heart and how it functions in relation to the lungs,” Dr. Kuvin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary angiogram&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re having new or worsening symptoms suggestive of heart disease or received abnormal test results that require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; A flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in your wrist or groin and threaded to the coronary arteries in your heart. Dye is injected to make it easier to get a detailed view of blood vessels on an X-ray image called an angiogram. You’ll likely get a light sedative to help you relax. As with Malin, results might lead to the immediate placement of a stent; a short hospital stay may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; It can detect restricted blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary calcium scan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; It can show whether there’s hardened plaque in the coronary arteries, which indicates a higher risk of heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll lie on a table that slides into a &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/imaging/services/cardiac-ct" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CT scanner.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CT scanner.&lt;/a&gt; Electrodes on your chest connect to a device that records heart activity and allows images of the coronary arteries to be taken between heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; Levels of calcium-containing plaque in arteries that can restrict blood flow to your heart. Results can determine if you need medication or lifestyle changes to reduce your heart attack risk. The test isn’t appropriate for someone with active heart symptoms, such as chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coronary CT angiography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it&lt;/strong&gt;: You have symptoms suggesting heart disease or have received abnormal results from other heart tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;: You’ll lie on a table that slides into a CT scanner. An IV will inject contrast dye that will help blood vessels show up better on CT images. Chest electrodes will also record heart rate. You might require medication to slow your heartbeat so the images are clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows&lt;/strong&gt;: Detailed images of the arteries can detect abnormalities in blood flow, show areas of plaque buildup and pinpoint areas in need of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Echocardiogram&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You have symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort or palpitations; you had a heart attack; or you may have heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; An ultrasound probe on your chest will bounce or “echo” sonogram waves off heart structures, showing moving images of heart walls and valves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; “It’s a great window into the heart,” Dr. Kuvin says. “We can see how the heart is functioning, including the muscle, valves and surrounding tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Electrocardiogram (EKG)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might need it:&lt;/strong&gt; You need a baseline test or you’re having symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Electrodes and wire leads will be placed on your chest, arms and legs. The leads are attached to an electrocardiograph machine that records your heart’s electrical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it shows:&lt;/strong&gt; The electric impulses of the heart and whether you’re having abnormal heart rhythms; it can also reveal a history of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When should you see a cardiologist?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people across the world. Seeing a cardiologist can make all the difference, but sometimes people don’t realize they should make an appointment, says Dr. Kuvin. ”We have advanced technologies that allow us to diagnose and treat heart conditions and improve and prolong life,” Dr. Kuvin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons to make an appointment with a cardiology provider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort (which may include pain in the arm, neck, jaw or back), palpitations or flutters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure or cholesterol that’s not responding to treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise intolerance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes or diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizzy spells or fainting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family history of early-onset or major cardiovascular problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications during pregnancy, including high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia or eclampsia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy or other cancer treatments, such as radiation or immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease or other systemic inflammatory diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of smoking or obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genetic condition known to raise the risk of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/insights/heart-checkup-9-tests-that-can-help" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northwell Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>aol.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE9Ga2VhaHNLMjJCX2lBLWZCM2ljRDI2anJLZnlOV2RBdUpuWnNCX3pCcVBPeFpETTFsRWF5bkQwTTc0b0FLaUI5Wkctem1RYVZabkFrUGE2aHRCTlN1</guid></item><item><title>家庭建议：我的争吵姻亲不可能在身边。现在他们毁了我女儿的生日派对。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/parenting-advice-bickering-in-laws.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqqk000i3b79603jydu6@published"&gt;My husband’s parents get along about as well as oil and water, but last weekend their bickering caused a major upset for our 6-year-old daughter “Alicia,” ruining her birthday party at our local kids’ fun center/arcade.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5f82zn000x3b7933ivl7n1@published"&gt;My father-in-law went to get another piece of cake, and my mother-in-law criticized him and made a snide remark about his weight. This ignited an argument that escalated to a shouting match, which culminated in her dumping a cup of soda on his head. They did this right in front of Alicia, her friends, cousins, and no small number of other parents who were there with their own children. The staff ended up asking my in-laws to leave. Alicia was left in tears and asked why her grandparents are always mean to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqsp000j3b795h52u04h@published"&gt;I want to impose a six-month timeout on my in-laws visiting with the condition that they either get into some kind of anger management or from now on they will have to take turns coming over individually. My husband thinks this is too much to ask; he says his parents have “always been like this” and to let it go. I don’t think it’s asking too much to shield my daughter from their dysfunction because two people in their 60s can’t behave like adults for a few hours. This is a perfectly reasonable position, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezqy4000m3b79jhzk90b0@published"&gt;It’s a fact that a solid quarter of the questions this advice column receives wouldn’t need to be asked if people stopped dismissing their spouses’ legitimate concerns and held their own parents accountable for the wild things they’ve done. But it is also true that some people in more volatile families learn to survive or cope by keeping their heads down, and I really do understand that, to a point. While I don’t think you need to just ignore what happened at the Fun Zone, as your husband seems to be suggesting, I read a lot of experience and resignation (and maybe hopelessness) in his comment about how his parents have “always been like this.” He has probably had to let a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things go just to stay sane and in a relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr02000n3b79dva7l0ju@published"&gt;Your expectations regarding your in-laws’ behavior seem totally reasonable to me. But sometimes there’s a lot of daylight between “reasonable” and “realistic.” Your husband’s parents have been sniping at each other all their lives. And some people are just not going to deal with their anger issues or go to therapy, no matter what you say to them. Some parents also refuse to listen to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; criticism from their own children, even when those children are fully grown and 100 percent correct. I don’t know if your in-laws are reachable on this—they may well be! That would be great. But it is often impossible to get people to change, even when they should.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr27000o3b79aif5stzr@published"&gt;You and your spouse cannot control how his parents choose to behave. You &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;decide who your family sees and spends time with, and how, and how often. If you personally need a break from your in-laws, that’s fine. If you strongly feel that your child needs to be “shielded” from her grandparents’ terrible behavior, that is also something you and your husband can discuss and figure out how to address. You can’t &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; your in-laws to change, but you can make suggestions (like anger management therapy), attempt to establish some rules for the time they spend with their granddaughter, or even insist on separate visits, as you suggested. The next time they cross a line, you and your family can also just leave.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr3x000p3b79x3rq02dr@published"&gt;I’m not making any excuses for your in-laws’ treatment of each other, which would also drive me up the wall. And I’m not saying that you have to just tolerate their particular brand of dysfunction. But you cannot hope to shield your child from all dysfunctional behavior forever. She’s already seen some things, and she will notice more and more as she gets older.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf5ezr5r000q3b79o72x7o31@published"&gt;Given all that, I think maybe the most important thing you can do, as a parent, is talk with her honestly about what she’s seeing and experiencing. Ask how she feels about what happened at the Fun Zone, or at other times with your family. Don’t pretend like everything is okay, or that certain behaviors are acceptable when they’re not. Make sure your child knows she can always share what she’s thinking or feeling with you. As she gets older, she, too, will have decisions to make about what she thinks is right, what sort of boundaries she needs, and what she’s willing to tolerate for the sake of relationships she cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

This was often painful for me, and I frequently felt like an odd duck. I grew up to be a still introverted but more outgoing adult. I have only a few close friends, but those friendships are rewarding and I’m generally a content person.

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian Randall “Bash” Williams, of Wellington, was taken from us tragically on Monday, September 1, 2025 at the age of 19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian was born the son of Brett Williams and Crystal Hill on July 11, 2006 in Wichita.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A charismatic and dedicated soul,  Bash could always be found with a sly grin that was his signature. He lived a life of loyalty, supportiveness, and energy that was as infectious as his smile. Sabastian was a young entrepreneur with an unwavering spirit of determination. He was a supportive friend, a dependable family member, and an individual who radiated respect and trustworthiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="more-105612"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;His love for cooking was notable, as he harbored dreams of becoming a chef one day. His other passions included music, collecting shoes, and the sanctuary of video games. Bash’s personality was as warm as a Kansas summer; his presence was like a melody that resonated within people’s hearts, leaving an indelible imprint. His love for hoodies was a testament to his laid-back style and a reflection of his easy-going nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;He will be remembered for his charisma, dedication, loyalty, and the unwavering support he offered to those around him. His memory will live on in the hearts of those he touched, as will his infectious grin and his love for life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sabastian is survived by his father, Brett Williams; mother, Crystal Hill (John); sister, Chenoa Williams (Hunter); brother, Sullivan Williams; nephew, August Cowherd; and grandparents, Randy Williams (Dianna); and Lisa Moore who will forever cherish their memories with him. His absence will be profoundly felt, yet his spirit will continue to flourish in their hearts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A viewing for Sabastian will be held on Friday, September 5, 2025, from 1 to 7 p.m., with family present from 5 to 7 p.m. at Cornejo Funeral Home &amp;amp; Crematory, 1030 Mission Road, Wellington, 67152. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Red meat, processed foods, and sweets are kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While variations of the Mediterranean diet have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-diet-helps-lower-dementia-risk-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;linked to reduced dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; before, a team led by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that it could be especially protective for people with two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; gene variant, almost acting as a countermeasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vegetarian-diets-can-slash-cancer-risk-by-up-to-45-large-study-finds"&gt;Vegetarian Diets Can Slash Cancer Risk by Up to 45%, Large Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.1668"&gt;in a randomized trial&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Yuxi Liu, from the Harvard Chan School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a complex condition, with risk factors known to include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-critical-thing-we-can-all-do-to-hold-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-tea-and-a-vitamin-supplement-could-protect-against-alzheimers"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-linked-to-stress-and-depression-and-we-may-know-why"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;. There's also a genetic element, because having one or two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene significantly increases the chances of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;getting the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated the Mediterranean diet in people with specific genetic backgrounds, while also analyzing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;blood metabolites&lt;/a&gt;: molecules that can act as indicators of how the body is functioning and processing food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173023" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173023" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign.jpg" alt="Study design" class="wp-image-173023 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyDesign-600x359.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173023" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study combined data on diet, cognition, and genetics.

This could give us a greater understanding of how Alzheimer's risk factors influence each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; genetic variant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the association is significant, the findings are based on well-educated individuals of European ancestry, and don't show direct cause and effect, suggesting there may be unknown factors having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the metabolite markers were only measured once, so the researchers don't have a full picture of how diet or the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-in-younger-people-is-often-overlooked-here-are-5-key-reasons"&gt;symptoms of dementia&lt;/a&gt; might have changed them over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, metabolite markers might be used to evaluate dementia risk and to target specific biological pathways for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03891-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In a small 2025 study published in the journal Biomolecules, 37 healthy people consumed 37 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil a day for 100 days. Blood and fecal tests showed that multiple markers of inflammation had decreased compared with pre-study levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="28e1f724-05ec-46e0-9efe-3ed7509eec91" data-toc-id="28e1f724-05ec-46e0-9efe-3ed7509eec91"&gt;Kefir or live yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A healthy gut microbiome containing "good" microbes is thought to lower markers of inflammation, according to a 2020 review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/5-fermented-foods-ex-noma-chef-has-in-fridge-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; such as kefir and live yogurts typically contain prebiotics — fiber that promotes "good" bacteria — and probiotics — or gut-friendly bugs — which make the gut microbiome more diverse and release helpful molecules. Buckley usually has one of the two for breakfast with some oats, milled chia seeds, and frozen berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some emerging evidence that fermented foods may reduce inflammation, too, Buckley said. A 2021 study published in the journal Nutrients found that of the 1,753 people involved, those who ate yogurt had lower levels of two markers of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1b7d130c-4949-47da-b02f-bcd00f93dc11" data-toc-id="1b7d130c-4949-47da-b02f-bcd00f93dc11"&gt;Oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foods containing omega-3 fatty acids — such as oily fish like salmon, sardines, and trout — have anti-inflammatory properties, Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 rich foods are thought to lower the risk of heart disease, which is partly why the American Heart Association recommends eating fish (particularly the oily kind) twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests it could decrease the risk of abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to sudden death, lower triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood, and slow the growth of fatty deposits that clog arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley likes to grill hers, season it with lots of extra virgin olive oil, lemon, and fresh herbs, which she keeps in the freezer, and pair it with a salad and rice or potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that excessive alcohol consumption &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-related-liver-deaths-have-increased-sharply-and-it-s-not-the-age-group-you-think"&gt;damages the liver&lt;/a&gt;, but a new study reveals a previously unknown vicious cycle that makes that damage worse. Chronic alcohol use makes it easier for bacteria to leak out of the gut and migrate to the liver, causing further harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by scientists at the University of California San Diego, examined human liver biopsies as well as mouse models of alcohol-associated liver disease. The team &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/alcohol-opens-the-floodgates-for-bad-bacteria"&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; chronic alcohol use impaired the production of a cellular signaling protein called mAChR4 in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower levels of this protein were found to interfere with the formation of what are called goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs). These specialized structures play a key role in teaching the immune system to respond to microbes, particularly those that escape the gut into other parts of the body, where they don't belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-what-happens-to-your-liver-when-you-quit-alcohol"&gt;Expert Reveals What Happens to Your Liver When You Quit Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this layer of protection, gut bacteria could escape and infiltrate organs such as the liver, where they risk exacerbating the damage associated with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172860" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172860" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-642x336.jpg" alt="Alcohol Could Help Gut Bacteria 'Leak' Into Your Liver And Cause Damage" class="wp-image-172860 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-642x336.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-793x415.jpg 793w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS-600x314.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Organoid-teaser-1200x628-UCSDHS.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172860" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A mouse liver  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="172857" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoid&lt;/a&gt;, used in the new experiments. (UC San Diego Health Sciences)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, though, it's a two-way street. The researchers found that if they restored the function of mAChR4, GAPs would form again, which in turn repaired the immune system's response to wayward gut bacteria, reducing liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be done either by using drugs to directly activate mAChR4 or by targeting related pathways that end up having the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the most direct health benefits would of course come from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol"&gt;reducing alcohol intake&lt;/a&gt;, that's not always as simple as it sounds. The team says that targeting mAChR4 could help minimize liver damage in other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protein could also play a bigger role in alcohol disorders. While it plays an important role in parts of the brain that regulate habits and addiction, mACHR4 is known to exist in lower levels in the brains of patients with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs that boost its levels in the brain are already being tested in &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04659161"&gt;clinical trials for schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, and could eventually be explored as a treatment for alcohol disorders too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09395-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” in 95% of the 23 beers tested across the United States, Mexico, and the Netherlands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The highest PFAS levels appeared in beers brewed near North Carolina’s Cape Fear River Basin, a region with documented water contamination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PFAS exposure has been linked to immune suppression, altered cholesterol and liver enzyme levels, and an increased risk of certain diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It seems that more and more people are becoming aware of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, better known as PFAS or "forever chemicals," which are found in a wide range of products and environments. As we previously reported, there has been a seven-fold increase in Google searches for the term "PFAS" over the last five years. While you may already know that these chemicals can be found on products that range from non-stick cookware to microwave popcorn bags, a new study reveals they are also widespread in beer. Here's what you need to know before ordering your next pint.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
As &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/how-to-avoid-pfas-chemicals-8636867" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine previously explained&lt;/a&gt;, PFAS chemicals are manmade chemicals and have been commonly used in certain consumer products since the 1950s. These chemicals are popular in consumer goods as they "impart oil, water, stain, and soil repellency," as well as "thermal stability and friction reduction," the Regulatory Council of Interstate Technology explained. That includes many of those moisture-wicking fabrics found in some athleticwear, along with certain beauty products like some waterproof mascaras, and even in our electronics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "PFAS is one of those super chemicals that can do just about anything, from making sure that your food doesn't stick to your pan to letting you wear a piece of clothing that can wick away water and just about anything in between," Dr. David Nadler,  research assistant professor at New York Institute of Technology, told F&amp;amp;W in 2024. "History shows us that these types of super chemicals that can do anything tend to be the most hazardous."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In April, researchers published their study, “&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c11265" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hold My Beer: The Linkage between Municipal Water and Brewing Location on PFAS in Popular Beverages,&lt;/a&gt;” in the journal ACS Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology. The study analyzed beers brewed in various regions across the United States, including North Carolina, Michigan, Colorado, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Missouri, as well as international beers from Mexico and the Netherlands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “As an occasional beer drinker myself, I wondered whether PFAS in water supplies was making its way into our pints,” research lead Jennifer Hoponick Redmon &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/study-finds-95-of-tested-beers-contain-toxic-forever-chemicals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “I hope these findings inspire water treatment strategies and policies that help reduce the likelihood of PFAS in future pours.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Redmon, she and her team adapted an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) method used to test PFAS levels in drinking water for analysis of 23 beers, including several brewed in regions with known water contamination, covering both domestic and international brands. They found PFAS in 95% of the beers tested, including perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The highest levels were detected in beers brewed near the Cape Fear River Basin in North Carolina, an area with documented PFAS pollution in the past, including both PFOS and PFOA.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The science of PFAS exposure is still evolving; however, Food &amp;amp; Wine previously pointed to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), which shared several "potential outcomes," including changes in cholesterol and liver enzyme levels, changes in infant birth weight, and changes in the immune system and response to certain vaccines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "One of the main outcomes is suppression of your immune responses after you get a vaccine," Dr. Jamie DeWitt, the director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at Oregon State University, who has long studied the human immune response to PFAS, shared. "The type of suppression that has been observed from PFAS and other environmental chemicals would be considered clinically to be mild to moderate. It doesn't mean that people are going to immediately get sick and immediately have problems, but we know from studies of people who are mildly to moderately immunosuppressed that there is an increased risk of infection and there is an increased risk of other types of diseases such as cancer."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-so-what-does-this-new-study-mean-for-beer"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; So, what does this new study mean for beer? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, there is no real way to avoid PFAS in your beer other than not drinking it. The authors mention that while they identified water as the likely source of PFAS, they also state that it is "possible that additional sources contribute to PFAS." This suggests that beer brewers could take responsibility for identifying and removing those sources to reduce the problem. As they concluded in the study, "By pinpointing the stages in the brewing process where PFAS contamination is most likely to occur, brewers can adopt best practices to minimize PFAS levels in their products. This not only enhances the quality and safety of the beer but also increases consumer trust and brand integrity."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, it's important to remember that the presence of PFAS in beer doesn't necessarily mean it's harmful at the levels detected. Many factors, including how much is consumed and the PFAS concentration, influence potential health effects. While staying informed is good, there's no need to panic; this study is a step toward understanding and improving the brewing process for everyone's benefit. Still, practicing moderation when drinking alcohol is wise, not just to ease concerns about PFAS, but also for overall health and well-being.&lt;br&gt;

Samples tested on 3 September at the country’s National Institute of Biomedical Research in the capital Kinshasa confirmed the cause of the outbreak as Ebola Zaire caused by Ebola virus disease.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national Rapid Response Team joined by World Health Organization (WHO) experts in epidemiology, infection prevention and control, laboratory and case management has been deployed to Kasai Province to rapidly strengthen disease surveillance, treatment and infection prevention and control in health facilities. Provincial risk communication experts have also been deployed to reach communities and help them understand how to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, WHO is delivering two tonnes of supplies including personal protective equipment, mobile laboratory equipment and medical supplies. The area is difficult to reach, taking at least one day of driving from Tshikapa (the provincial capital of Kasai), with few air links.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re acting with determination to rapidly halt the spread of the virus and protect communities,” said Dr Mohamed Janabi, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Banking on the country’s long-standing expertise in controlling viral disease outbreaks, we’re working closely with the health authorities to quickly scale up key response measures to end the outbreak as soon as possible.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case numbers are likely to increase as the transmission is ongoing. Response teams and local teams will work to find the people who may be infected and need to receive care, to ensure everyone is protected as quickly as possible.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country has a stockpile of treatments, as well as 2000 doses of the Ervebo Ebola vaccine, effective to protect against this type of Ebola, already prepositioned in Kinshasa that will be quickly moved to Kasai to vaccinate contacts and frontline health workers.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s last outbreak of Ebola virus disease affected the north-western Equateur province in April 2022. It was brought under control in under three months thanks to the robust efforts of the health authorities. In Kasai province, previous outbreaks of Ebola virus disease were reported in 2007 and 2008. In the country overall, there have been 15 outbreaks since the disease was first identified in 1976.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola virus disease is a rare but severe, often fatal illness in humans. It is transmitted to people through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats (thought to be the natural hosts). Human-to-human transmission is through direct contact with blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola, objects that have been contaminated with body fluids from a person sick with Ebola or the body of a person who died from Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Lobel shielded her eyes and expected to have a deadly anaphylactic reaction, she said in a 2015 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Farticle%2F20150327-how-a-bee-sting-saved-my-life&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65972471%2Fbee-venom-lyme%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC article;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BBC article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describing her experience. The 45-year-old English woman was in palliative care in California because she was &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65400717/third-state-life-after-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dying;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt; from Lyme disease. She had stepped outside to experience some sunshine and peace when the bees attacked. Swollen and in pain, Lobel expected the end was imminent. At least, that’s what she thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fifteen years earlier, Lobel had unknowingly endured a tick bite. The &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65801609/red-meat-allergy-ticks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tick;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; carried the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, which causes Lyme disease. If caught in time, Lyme disease is treatable with antibiotics, though the bacteria are known to sneak around the immune system and even cause flare-ups long after apparent recovery. &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; can travel everywhere in the body, even to the heart and brain, causing neurological degradation, terrible pain, and a host of complications. About 476,000 people per year get Lyme disease in the U.S., according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=This%20number%20reflects%20cases%20reported%20through%20routine,disease%20each%20year%20in%20the%20United%20States." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from March. Unfortunately, Lobel—whose doctors didn’t identify the symptoms as Lyme disease until over a year after she was bitten at age 27—was one of the unlucky ones. Suffering with increasingly unbearable symptoms in a body that was breaking down, Lobel had accepted that she wouldn’t live long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For three days after the bee attack, Lobel endured fevers and throbbing inflammation. On the fourth day, she woke and unexpectedly felt normal, the first time she felt a sliver of normalcy in 15 years. Over the next days, weeks, and months, Lobel’s condition improved dramatically, her brain fog clearing, her pain diminishing, and her strength returning. While researching bee venom, she realized that the melittin in the venom, which causes an instant burning sensation under the skin during bee stings, must have been her savior. Blood tests later confirmed that there was no more &lt;em&gt;Borrelia&lt;/em&gt; in her body. It was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many cultures have touted the benefits of animal venom. Bee venom therapy in particular has been used as far back as ancient Egypt, says a 2024 article from research database company &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/health-and-medicine/bee-venom-therapy#:~:text=Bee%20venom%20therapy%2C%20also%20known,debate%20within%20the%20medical%20community." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EBSCO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;EBSCO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Modern studies show that bee venom’s key component melittin has “antibacterial and antifungal activities, and potential anti-tumor properties,” according to a 2017 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5563768/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10385528/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mice and in vitro studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mice and in vitro studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have also proven its antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-cancer effects. A small protein molecule composed of 26 amino acids, melittin contains both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory compounds, and it can literally make bacterial cells explode because it weakens a cell’s protective membrane. A November 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/6/4/31" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of bee venom and melittin published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/em&gt; showed that, at least outside of a living organism, the compound killed &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers looking for new therapeutic drugs have been making forays into the potential of animal venom for decades, with some succeeding. Perhaps the most famous contemporary example is Ozempic, whose main drug compound mimics a venom component of the Gila monster, a venomous lizard native to the southwestern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 1997, Glenn King at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia put the venom of the deadly Australian funnel-web spider under scrutiny, and figured out how to tease out its disparate components. “I was just blown away,” he told the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Farticle%2F20150327-how-a-bee-sting-saved-my-life&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65972471%2Fbee-venom-lyme%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BBC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This is an absolute pharmacological goldmine that nobody’s really looked at.” Now he and other researchers are developing a &lt;a href="https://news.uq.edu.au/2024-10-07-spider-venom-heart-drug-moves-clinical-trials" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; from a key molecule in the venom that prevents injuries to heart cells during heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many therapeutic venom studies haven’t passed the point of animal testing though. Anecdotal and preliminary studies show that bee venom could relieve pain, symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis when a trained medical professional injects it under the skin. Bee venom is also being investigated for use in killing HIV cells. However, more research is needed before it could potentially become a standard treatment for any of these conditions, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lobel herself went on to experiment extensively with bee venom—on herself—and eventually developed a self-administered treatment protocol for Lyme disease, ensuring the elimination of her own disease in the process. She has spent the past several years promoting her Bee Venom Therapy protocol for Lyme disease—which uses live honey bees’ stings—and educating people about the disease. Lobel has also written a book about how to self-administer bee sting therapy if you suffer from this disease. However, medical professionals consider it a controversial alternative treatment because it is not approved by any medical agency, and the Centers for Disease Control doesn’t mention it as a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people who have used the therapy and found relief, like &lt;a href="https://lymediseaseuk.com/bee-venom-therapy-rebecca-hayward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rebecca Hayward;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rebecca Hayward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the UK, report that it’s a last-ditch effort because nothing else has worked to relieve their terrible symptoms. But the treatment doesn’t work the same for everybody, she cautions, and the very real possibility of dying from a bee venom allergy always hovers in the background. The top of Hayward’s article on the Lyme Disease UK website recommends not attempting self-treatment “without precautionary measures and oversight by a medical professional.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure

class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas Disease, a parasitic infection transmitted by "kissing bugs," has been confirmed in Southern California, raising significant public health concerns. The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is spread through the feces of infected triatomine bugs. While early symptoms may be mild or absent, chronic infection can lead to severe complications, including heart failure and digestive issues. Experts emphasise the importance of early detection and treatment, particularly for individuals in rural areas where kissing bugs are prevalent. Preventive measures include avoiding bug bites and seeking medical attention if symptoms develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection of kissing bugs and local transmission of Chagas Disease in California highlights an emerging public health challenge. With the disease capable of causing severe and sometimes fatal outcomes if left untreated, understanding the risks, symptoms, and treatment options is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chagas disease threat grows in the US: Transmission and ‘kissing bug’ risk explained&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are growing increasingly concerned about the local transmission of Chagas Disease in the United States. So far, at least eight cases have been confirmed to have been transmitted domestically as reported by ABC7 Eyewitness News. This alarming trend has led experts to urge the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to officially declare Chagas Disease endemic in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the threat rises, it is essential to understand what Chagas Disease is, how it spreads primarily through ‘kissing bugs,’ and how to identify its symptoms early to prevent serious health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are ‘kissing bugs’? The insect behind Chagas disease transmission&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name “kissing bugs” comes from the insects’ tendency to bite humans around the face, particularly near the mouth and eyes. These blood-sucking insects have become firmly established in Southern California, with sightings in areas like Griffith Park. But California is not alone: these bugs have been reported in at least 32 other US states, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona as reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs feed on the blood of humans, pets, and wild animals. Their bite is painless but can transmit the parasite responsible for Chagas Disease. According to Texas A&amp;amp;M’s Kissing Bugs Program, their preference for attacking facial areas is what earned them this distinctive nickname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Chagas disease: Know its symptoms &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This infection can remain silent for years, but if left undiagnosed or untreated, it can lead to severe health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization emphasises that timely diagnosis and proper medical intervention are key to preventing life-threatening outcomes associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chagas disease: Symptoms in acute and chronic phases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease manifests in two main phases, each with distinct symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Acute phase symptoms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phase lasts approximately two months after infection. Common symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever and headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enlarged lymph nodes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle pain and fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abdominal or chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling at the bite site, sometimes a purplish swelling of the eyelid (known as Romaña’s sign)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These initial symptoms can be mild and easily mistaken for other illnesses, which often leads to underdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic phase symptoms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, the parasite hides in the heart and digestive muscles, leading to long-term complications one to three decades post-infection. Around one-third of infected individuals develop cardiac problems, such as arrhythmias and progressive heart failure.

It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire," Gallagher, who has had to have multiple surgeries, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Florida mom was warned by doctors that she might die or lose her leg after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria following a swim near a local beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 27, Genevieve Gallagher, 49, of Pensacola, went for a swim with her 7-year-old daughter, Mila, in Santa Rosa Sound off Pensacola Beach, per the &lt;a href="https://eu.pnj.com/story/news/local/escambia-county/2025/09/03/vibro-bacteria-on-pensacola-beach-threatens-life-of-woman-after-swim/85830159007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pensacola News Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher and her husband, Dana, had gone boating behind the Pensacola Beach Boardwalk, before she and her daughter decided to go for a dip near Quietwater Beach, the outlet noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, on July 30, Gallagher started to experience symptoms of an infection, including sweats. Her leg also swelled and bubbled with blisters, so she was rushed into surgery that afternoon, and she learned she'd contracted the flesh-eating bacteria known as Vibrio vulnificus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher believes she caught the infection through a small cut on her left leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Vibrio vulnificus is a type of bacteria that can cause a fatal infection. You get it from eating uncooked or undercooked shellfish or when seawater enters a wound."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms get worse quickly. They include fever, low blood pressure and painful blisters," the site adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher, who has been undergoing treatment at UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, had to have most of the tissue on her left leg below the knee removed to try and stop the bacteria from spreading, the&lt;em&gt; Pensacola News Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Vibrio cholerae bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought I had an infection, but never did I think I had a flesh-eating bacterium,” she told the paper. “[There are] no antibiotics that they can give you to stop it. They just have to get out any infected skin and tissue. They’ve got to get it off your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher was intubated for nearly a week after going into septic shock amid the infection. Medical staff repeatedly scrubbed and cleaned out her leg in an attempt to remove any dying tissue. Doctors ended up warning the family that Gallagher might lose her leg or even her life to the illness, the paper noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were finally able to get me stable enough to wake me up, thank God,” Gallagher told the outlet, adding of her daughter, “Mila saw me in the hospital and said, ‘I wish this happened to me and not you,’ and I started crying. That broke my heart."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was like ‘Mila, no, I'm so glad it didn't happen to you. Your little body could not have taken all this that's going on,’” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher, who has had multiple surgeries, shared, “Just looking at my leg, it doesn't even look like my leg anymore. It looks deformed right now. The pain is unbelievable. It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire. That's what it feels like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Florida Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Florida Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, there have been 23 cases of Vibrio vulnificus in the state this year so far, and five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium that normally lives in warm seawater and is part of a group of vibrios that are called 'halophilic' because they require salt," the government agency said on its website, adding that "infections are rare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site stated, "Water and wounds do not mix. Do not enter the water if you have fresh cuts or scrapes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher said that on the day she and her daughter went swimming, she attempted to cover her cut with a waterproof bandage, per the &lt;em&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/em&gt;. She insisted that if she'd known the risks, she would never have entered the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it's so hot and that water is not moving, that bacteria is just growing and growing and growing,” she told the newspaper. “There are no signs out there saying, ‘Hey, this water has a high infection rate for vibrio,’ or, ‘Hey, this water tested positive,’ like they do in Panama City, because I'm sure if they did, people would not be swimming over there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UF Health and Escambia County Commissioner Ashlee Hofberger, who represents Pensacola Beach, didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE for comment. PEOPLE has also reached out to Gallagher for an update on her recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-flesh-eating-bacteria-swim-near-florida-beach-fatal-lose-leg-11803202" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>aol.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 11:50:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE10Q3FxbVNpYTlDOG5sazUyNTlCYmxKc2tzLTVOWkVCc25McXZWQ1UzcFlqUnl1VG84NS0xMXpqb1h6aXJlc0VkMGZpVWdRcXU3ZEU4dmx1U1U1cjJLMll4UVlfWW56OVVObVF4Tk5ZRXE</guid></item><item><title>我的眼睛干涩是鲜为人知的疾病的迹象，主要是女性-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15065219/My-dry-eyes-gut-symptoms-signs-little-known-disease-mainly-strikes-women-heres-test-you-ask-avoid-years-suffering.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Louise Mountford was blue-lighted to hospital in an ambulance with agonising pain just below her right ribs, she was convinced something in her stomach was about to burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I normally had a high pain threshold, but I was crying out with pain even though I was given morphine,’ says Louise, 66, who runs a farm in Shropshire with her husband David, 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans and tests found no obvious problem, however. Instead doctors concluded it was ‘probably constipation’ and gave her an enema and intravenous paracetamol. But it wasn’t an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louise had been struggling with a range of unexplained gut symptoms, including diarrhoea, bloating and difficulties swallowing dry food for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I could go three days without a bowel movement and then have explosive diarrhoea,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I also had painful bloating, which made me feel heavy and weepy. I thought it was strange to suddenly start having these symptoms in my late-50s.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet neither a gastroscopy (where a camera is passed down the throat to inspect the gullet and stomach) nor a colonoscopy (where a similar device is passed via the anus to inspect the bowel) revealed anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also began to suffer with other new – apparently unrelated – symptoms: dry eyes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, jaw pain and dental problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After four years of mystifying symptoms, Louise Mountford was diagnosed with Sjögren’s disease, a little-known but relatively common condition where the immune system attacks any tissues that produce moisture in the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I also had no tears and couldn’t cry,’ says Louise. ‘I couldn’t eat crackers or any meat unless it was covered in a sauce as my mouth was so dry I couldn’t swallow.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day she was rushed to hospital she’d been doubled up on the floor, rocking back and forth on her bedroom floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalls: ‘The pain had been building up all day from 3pm when I was in a meeting. By 10pm I’d taken the maximum dose of paracetamol, and yet the pain was relentless. I’d never known anything like it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet all standard hospital tests that day came back negative, again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By now frustrated and feeling desperate, she consulted a private gastroenterologist, who ordered a gut transit test – which involved swallowing a pill containing a tiny camera that travelled through her gut, recording images. But again nothing was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the specialist also ordered blood tests to check for antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases – and this proved to be a breakthrough after four years of mystifying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louise was found to have antibodies called anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La – both are associated with Sjögren’s disease, a little-known but relatively common condition where the immune system attacks any tissues that produce moisture in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It explained the odd mix of symptoms that had plagued Louise for four years – she saw a rheumatologist privately a month later who confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Professor Simon Bowman, a consultant rheumatologist at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, told the Daily Mail, Sjögren’s affects secretory glands all over the body, which include secretory glands from the mouth to the anus, in the nasal passages, breathing tubes, lungs, vagina and bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Louise’s symptoms included dry eyes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, jaw pain and dental problems. ‘I had no tears and couldn’t cry,’ she says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the gut symptoms are related to dryness and research by Limoges University Hospital in France, published in Advances in Rheumatology in 2021, found 95 per cent of the Sjögren’s patients studied had gut symptoms, such as abdominal pain and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sjögren’s used to be considered rare. However, Dr Kelsey Jordan, a consultant rheumatologist at the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, says it’s now believed to affect around 1 per cent of the population. But this could be an underestimate – some estimates put the true figure at half a million sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically it’s women aged 40 to 60 who are affected. However, 10 per cent of cases are men and younger people can also develop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact cause is unclear, but certain genes are implicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But lack of awareness of the condition, coupled with the varied nature of the symptoms, means it can often be overlooked by healthcare professionals, says Dr Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, patients with milder symptoms may never be referred for specialist assessment or else get referred ‘many years after their symptoms first start, meaning they could miss out on treatment for years’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Updated guidelines from the British Society of Rheumatology published in the journal Rheumatology earlier this year [2025] recommend a number of specific tests for Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as tests for dry eyes, salivary flow and the Schirmer test, used to measure tear production, these include the anti-Ro antibody blood test, which detects antibodies produced by our immune system to clear bacteria and viruses: in some people antibodies bind to proteins in our own body causing damage to healthy tissue – several of these autoantibodies are seen in Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bowman notes that some people can test negative for antibodies but still have all the symptoms – in which case, doctors can use their clinical judgement to make a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Delayed diagnosis can cause long-term complications. Over time, left untreated, Sjögren’s can damage the kidneys, blood vessels, liver, pancreas, nerves and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sjögren’s patients also have a four to seven-fold increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bowman says: ‘There is evidence that a high level of Sjögren’s disease activity is linked to a greater risk of developing lymphoma and greater mortality rates – so arguably if there is earlier diagnosis and intervention this risk might be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In addition, some patients have high levels of fatigue, dryness and other symptoms and so an earlier diagnosis may improve their quality of life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years there has been greater awareness of Sjögren’s and in the US at a least, the average time it takes to be diagnosed has improved from six years to around three years. according to the Sjögren’s Foundation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Nevertheless, it is not as well known as other rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus,’ says Professor Bowman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katherine George, 35, a social media director, was diagnosed with Sjögren’s in 2022 aged 33 – after experiencing digestive and dry eye symptoms since the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It sounds silly but I’ve never been able to eat a dry biscuit, I’ve always had to dunk it in tea to be able to swallow it,’ she says. ‘My mouth and throat has always felt so dry and I would sometimes feel like I was choking just trying to get food down.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katherine was finally diagnosed after an optician noticed her dry eyes and ordered an antibody test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Six weeks later I found out I had Sjögren’s – I ticked nearly every box when a rheumatologist showed me a long list of symptoms which included digestive problems, dry eyes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, a persistent cough, mouth ulcers and fatigue,’ says Katherine, who lives in Falmouth, Cornwall, with husband Ross, 35, a heating engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Looking back, I’m amazed no doctor ever connected all the different symptoms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to treatment the new British Society of Rheumatology guidelines recommend preservative-free eyedrops (preservatives can irritate the eyes), using artificial saliva drops for dry mouth and the drug pilocarpine, which stimulates secretion glands, for treating dryness throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug hydroxychloroquine can also be prescribed in more severe cases where previous treatments haven’t worked, as well as newer disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate, which help by suppressing the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research suggests there may be other, improved treatments around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trial results announced in August for the drug ianalumab, a monoclonal antibody drug (which targets immune cells called B cells) showed it significantly improved symptoms in Sjögren’s patients. The manufacturer, Novartis, is set to submit the drug for fast-track approval in the US; with a UK approval expected shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louise was prescribed hydroxychloroquine, but suffered side-effects including severe headaches and nausea and was taken off it. She now uses eye drops, saliva substitutes and vaginal pessaries for dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve seen a dietitian and got advice about a healthy diet and now eat lots of greens and drink three litres of water a day to prevent constipation,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Taking medication for all my Sjögren’s symptoms is time-consuming and like a military operation. I have to spend 20 minutes steaming my eyes and put eyedrops in seven times a day.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s important people know Sjögren’s isn’t just a dry eye or dry mouth disease, greater awareness of the other symptoms could speed up diagnosis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There isn’t currently a drug available that will treat the underlying cause of Sjögren’s just treatments for individual symptoms – but I’m hopeful because of new research that there will be one soon.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Back in my 20s, 30s, and even 40s, there was less of an emphasis on exercise for lifelong health, and I probably (or, definitely) worked out initially for aesthetic reasons. I always loved group fitness, and in my 20s and 30s, I lived in aerobics classes (even taught them for a few years!) and did plenty of cardio. In my 40s and 50s, I mixed it up with running, cycling classes, tennis, high-impact bootcamps, and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a26346087/what-is-barre/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a26346087/what-is-barre/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="barre" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;barre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="but-by-my-40s-and-50s-the-injuries-started-stacking-up" data-node-id="1" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;But by my 40s and 50s, the injuries started stacking up.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I unfortunately tore both ACLs—my right knee in my mid-40s and my left in my early 50s—both while playing tennis.

Still, I continued exercising as much as possible, and in my late 50s, took up &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64272959/reformer-pilates-vs-mat-pilates/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64272959/reformer-pilates-vs-mat-pilates/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reformer pilates" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;reformer pilates&lt;/a&gt; classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;By the time I hit my 60s, a DEXA scan showed that I had osteopenia (the precursor to osteoporosis), and I was shocked  since I had always been so active. Then, last year at age 62, I underwent a left shoulder replacement, also related to osteoarthritis (and possibly worsened by too much reformer pilates). After both my knee and shoulder replacement surgeries, I was blown away by how much muscle mass I lost almost immediately from having to pause working out—and from getting older. I hated to admit it, but at 60, I began noticing how much harder it was to put muscle back on, even though I had never struggled with it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;During my time off after my shoulder replacement, I realized that I needed to make some changes to my workout routine, and I was also learning about how important it is to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61691102/how-much-weight-should-i-lift-2024/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61691102/how-much-weight-should-i-lift-2024/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lift heavy weights" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;lift heavy weights&lt;/a&gt;, especially while getting older, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a42447798/how-to-build-muscle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a42447798/how-to-build-muscle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="to build and maintain muscle" data-node-id="5.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;to build and maintain muscle&lt;/a&gt;. And even though I had exercised  consistently for 40+ years, I had never done pure strength training or just gone to the gym and lifted weights on my own, because I preferred group classes and didn’t really feel great walking into a gym not knowing what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-decided-to-fully-pivot-my-workout-habits-and-go-all-in-on-strength-training-in-my-60s" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;I decided to fully pivot my workout habits and go all in on strength training in my 60s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I started lifting heavier than ever and prioritizing protein. I found a personal trainer and started focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="strength and power training" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;strength and power training&lt;/a&gt; to help me stay strong as I age. I began working with my personal trainer, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/riddickfit_blueprint/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/riddickfit_blueprint/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Justin Riddick" data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="7.3.0"&gt;Justin Riddick&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about five months ago, when we met at my gym. I decided to start training with him because I needed help strengthening my shoulder after the replacement. Plus, I wanted to work on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g44302167/best-bodyweight-exercises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g44302167/best-bodyweight-exercises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="full-body strength" data-node-id="7.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;full-body strength&lt;/a&gt; by lifting weights, and I wasn’t sure what kind of movements to do on my own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I’ve already learned so much from him about proper form, and he’s challenged me to lift heavier than I thought I could. We train strength and power in the big muscle groups, like quads, glutes, and back, continue to rehab my shoulder, and do balance, agility, and plyometric work to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62704292/exercise-for-bone-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62704292/exercise-for-bone-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="improve my bone health" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;improve my bone health&lt;/a&gt;.

Going through rehab and physical therapy was pretty grueling, but in my mind, I had no choice but to do everything I could do to recover, because I want to live a full and active life. So I followed doctor's orders, went  to physical therapy, and continued to work out during my recovery the best I could. My goal was to keep moving no matter what. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-18" data-node-id="27" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-y6m8k e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img draggable="true" alt="dena aloian crews" title="dena aloian crews" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-08-51-pm-68b75d9ebc4b0.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-08-51-pm-68b75d9ebc4b0.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-08-51-pm-68b75d9ebc4b0.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-08-51-pm-68b75d9ebc4b0.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Dena Aloian Crews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;2. &lt;strong data-node-id="28.1"&gt;Instead of focusing on what I can’t do anymore, I think of what I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.2"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="28.2.0"&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.3"&gt;do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="29" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I've had to make peace with the fact that I can't do now what I could do at age 20, 30, or even 40, but I can keep  moving and have a good attitude. For instance, I can’t run or do high-impact bootcamp classes with ballistic jumps because those movements hurt my knees, so I instead focus on lower-impact cardio like walking and cycling. Plus, I love snow skiing, but I can’t hit the slopes hard every day during vacations anymore because of my knees. So, I just take a day off in between and sit by the fire reading instead (which is so nice!), and I don’t go as hard on the slopes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-19" data-node-id="31" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-y6m8k e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img draggable="true" alt="dena aloian crews" title="dena aloian crews" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-59-pm-68b75d6909522.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Dena Aloian Crews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When I'm tempted to feel sad or depressed about what I can't do anymore, I try to turn it around and think about how grateful I am for my body and how it's my vehicle for experiencing the world.

I'm hoping to live 30+ more years, and I want to be able to travel, walk and hike for miles, play with grandkids, lift heavy bags, maintain my balance, and generally get through my days with energy and vitality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I’m especially motivated to reach this goal because when my mother was in the last few years of her life,  she suffered from sarcopenia and literally shrank due to an illness that kept her from doing much physically, which was heartbreaking. Even with all of the exercise I’ve done my entire life, I was still diagnosed with osteopenia, but my goal is to reverse it if possible through my lifestyle and exercise routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-20" data-node-id="37" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-y6m8k e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img draggable="true" alt="dena aloian crews" title="dena aloian crews" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-09-02-at-5-07-55-pm-68b75dc1915e3.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Dena Aloian Crews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;With that, I have the mindset that exercise isn’t optional—it’s as important to my health as brushing my teeth, sleeping, and eating healthily. And I don’t wait until I &lt;em data-node-id="38.1"&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like working out to do it, because I almost never actually feel like it ahead of time. I’m a big believer in scheduling it just like any other important appointment.

Don’t get me wrong—it’s been a slow process to build back strength and muscle after my surgeries, and I definitely have different physical limits now, but I know I can still be strong and active. I’m not giving up on my goal of having a long healthspan, of living healthily for a long time, doing the things I want to do, and spending every day learning, growing, and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-21" data-node-id="40" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;div data-node-id="gallery-carousel" aria-label="Gallery Carousel" aria-roledescription="carousel" role="region" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="PP0-21-0" data-theme-key="carousel-container" class="css-6nqxsx e1kgjrvy4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1t3oi0e e1kgjrvy3"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PP0-21-0" data-theme-key="carousel-hed" class="css-4i2xvz e1kgjrvy5"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Find the Perfect Women's Health Training Program for You&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-1cav9c0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/33873c75-869c-4c6d-8832-b09bfb739ec6_1736521604.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Addison Aloian, NASM-CPT" title="Headshot of Addison Aloian, NASM-CPT" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addison Aloian is the associate health &amp;amp; fitness editor at Women’s Health, where she writes and edits across the health, weight loss, and fitness verticals.

She was tired, and her legs had been swollen for weeks. When her daughter called on a Saturday to see if Zoslocki wanted to come make pizza with her family, her mother told her she wasn’t feeling well and wanted to stay home. Her daughter figured she was struggling with a run-of-the-mill yet stubborn &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a33503442/bronchitis-vs-pneumonia/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a33503442/bronchitis-vs-pneumonia/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="respiratory infection" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt;—bronchitis, perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When her coughing continued all weekend, Zoslocki’s husband finally convinced her to go to urgent care. The nurse on duty, a friend, told her she needed to go to the emergency room for a scan. Her problem, it turned out, wasn’t bronchitis or any kind of respiratory issue at all. Instead, it was her &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;: The left ventricle—the main pumping chamber—had stopped working properly, and her heart had swollen up like a balloon. “I was just really surprised,” Zoslocki says. She never, for even a second, considered that she might be dealing with a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39003295/heart-health-quiz/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39003295/heart-health-quiz/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cardiovascular problem" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cardiovascular problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Zoslocki’s condition, known as takotsubo syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy, is often serious and can be fatal. Up to 8 percent of people who experience takotsubo die from it, and 4 to 10 percent of patients will have another episode within five years. Survivors also have a higher risk of death, heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Takotsubo’s prime target? Postmenopausal women like Zoslocki. In fact, 80 to 90 percent of cases occur in women, and the average age is 69, per a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109724079713" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109724079713" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recent study" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em data-node-id="5.3"&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology.&lt;/em&gt; The syndrome is often triggered by major emotional events, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60965334/allison-holker-yoga-self-care-grief/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60965334/allison-holker-yoga-self-care-grief/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="death of a spouse" data-node-id="5.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;death of a spouse&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a64968989/moving-on-after-divorce-tips/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a64968989/moving-on-after-divorce-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="divorce" data-node-id="5.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;divorce&lt;/a&gt;, which is why it’s colloquially called “broken heart syndrome.” But happy stressors (like a surprise party or winning the lottery) and, increasingly, physical stressors (like a car crash or major surgery) seem to trigger it too.&lt;br data-node-id="5.9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In Zoslocki’s case, the extreme emotional trigger was likely a big family argument, per her doctors. In the months before she was diagnosed with takotsubo, Zoslocki says, her sister was accusing her of trying to take control of their dying mother’s estate. “I was so stressed out, I didn’t know what to do with my emotions,” she says. “I wanted to run into the street and scream.”&lt;br data-node-id="6.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, in as many as one in three cases, doctors aren’t able to identify a single trigger. And even though takotsubo often &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46628300/women-heart-attack-scad/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46628300/women-heart-attack-scad/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="presents like a heart attack" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;presents like a heart attack&lt;/a&gt; at first—usually starting with the classic symptoms of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17857-broken-heart-syndrome" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17857-broken-heart-syndrome" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chest pain" data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and shortness of breath—the syndrome occurs &lt;em data-node-id="7.5"&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the arteries being blocked and often without any heart risk factors either. Instead, the heart’s left ventricle suddenly stops pumping properly (doctors don’t yet understand the biological mechanism that causes this disruption), then part of the heart swells up so it looks like a &lt;em data-node-id="7.7"&gt;takotsubo&lt;/em&gt;, a Japanese pot used to catch an octopus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s taken decades for doctors to begin understanding the condition. Initially, many dismissed takotsubo as a panic attack or &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/03/06/changing-the-way-we-view-womens-heart-attack-symptoms" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/03/06/changing-the-way-we-view-womens-heart-attack-symptoms" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="misdiagnosed" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; it as an actual heart attack (which resulted in patients taking meds to treat a condition they didn’t have). “Some clinicians were not even convinced that it actually existed,” says Dana Dawson, MD, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and a leading takotsubo researcher. “It was brushed under the rug, and people were labeled with acute myocardial infarction [heart attack], treated as such, patted on the back, and let go with the wrong medications.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="unraveling-a-mysterious-syndrome" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Unraveling a Mysterious Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Being misdiagnosed is not a new phenomenon when it comes to women and heart problems. Despite heart disease consistently ranking as a leading cause of death for women around the world—and the number one killer of women in the U.S.—research shows that heart symptoms in women are more likely to be misdiagnosed or missed altogether than they are in men, with often devastating repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Currently, with no single official diagnostic test for takotsubo syndrome, doctors rely on a process of elimination, often performing multiple tests and completing advanced heart imaging to rule out a heart attack and other common heart issues first. Patients who experience more subtle symptoms (think general fatigue, nausea, or simply a vague ill feeling) may put off seeking care, says David Newby, MD, the British Heart Foundation Duke of Edinburgh Chair of Cardiology at the University of Edinburgh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Takotsubo syndrome was first scientifically described in Japan in 1990 but didn’t become widely recognized by doctors until 15 years later, when a group of physicians published a study in &lt;em data-node-id="13.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa043046" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa043046" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New England Journal of Medicine" data-node-id="13.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; looking at 19 patients who presented with dysfunction in their left heart ventricle after “sudden emotional stress.” And in the two decades since then, researchers have established major centers around the world devoted to studying takotsubo. Patient registries now exist on several continents, collecting data in Europe, the United Kingdom, Japan, New York, and California, among other places. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The syndrome is quite rare: Studies estimate it accounts for only about &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.055854" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.055854" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2 to 3 percent" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;2 to 3 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all acute coronary syndrome patients and up to 6 percent of female patients who seek help for suspected heart attacks.

So far, there are no approved methods for treating takotsubo directly, so doctors do what they can to provide “supportive care” for patients, which involves minimizing stress and giving medications that can help address specific heart-related symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But a targeted treatment for takotsubo is necessary, says Dr. Dawson, as research has largely shown that even if existing medications can help with some symptoms, they do not reduce patients’ chances of having another takotsubo episode or dying from heart-related causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And while there’s a clear stress connection with takotsubo, experts also think menopause could be a factor in its development, since the syndrome overwhelmingly affects women. &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/estrogen-and-heart-health" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/estrogen-and-heart-health" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Estrogen protects a woman’s heart" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Estrogen protects a woman’s heart&lt;/a&gt; by relaxing blood vessels and increasing “good” cholesterol while decreasing “bad” cholesterol. As women approach and go through menopause, estrogen levels begin to fluctuate and eventually drop. So researchers believe that having less of that protective estrogen may leave older women more susceptible to developing takotsubo. Indeed, women’s risk for high blood pressure and heart disease increases during menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-22" data-node-id="19" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-1pxsip e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More On Women's Heart Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The different biological mechanisms that women and men use to control their blood pressure may provide another clue, says C. Noel Bairey Merz, MD, director of the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Men are more dependent on their sympathetic nervous system—which uses stress hormones to communicate with other parts of the body—to regulate blood pressure. Women, by contrast, have alternate biological means of regulating blood pressure, including other aspects of their autonomic nervous system and, possibly, estrogen. (Spoiler: Scientists don’t fully understand women’s alternate mechanisms yet.) But this could mean that women going through menopause are more vulnerable to heart injury since they have less routine exposure to these stress hormone surges and are then experiencing them with less protective estrogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-brain-heart-connection" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;The Brain-Heart Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Examining how the heart relates to other parts of the body—especially the brain, with which it has a long-recognized but complex connection—could also help crack the condition’s complex code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many studies have found high rates of depression, anxiety, and other &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.055854" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.055854" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="psychological disorders" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;psychological disorders&lt;/a&gt; among patients with takotsubo—a link that also exists in general cases of cardiovascular disease. But one study shows this connection is stronger for takotsubo patients than for traditional heart attack patients and may be critical to understanding takotsubo, says Jelena Templin-Ghadri, MD, one of the researchers and a cardiologist affiliated with the University of Zurich’s Center for Molecular Cardiology and the University Medicine Greifswald in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doctors now believe that a rush of stress hormones—including adrenaline and dopamine—damages the heart. In fact, Dr. Templin-Ghadri and other scientists working on the InterTAK Registry found that patients with the syndrome often have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6462306/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6462306/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="abnormalities in their limbic system" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;abnormalities in their limbic system&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain that regulates emotional and stress responses. Their findings suggest that heightened activity in those brain areas during emotional or physical stress can trigger the autonomic nervous system to send a rush of stress hormones through the body that may cause the heart to weaken. (But why those hormone surges hurt the heart, especially in women, is still not totally clear.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;At Northwell Health in New York, cardiologists connect the brain-heart dots during treatment and regularly refer patients (not just those with broken heart syndrome!) to a clinical health psychologist with expertise in women’s health and behavioral cardiology. Lead psychologist Bella Grossman, PhD, works with heart patients at Northwell Health’s Katz Institute for Women’s Health using cognitive behavioral therapy to help them with anxiety, depression, sleep concerns, and stress management, all aimed at helping patients manage their particular cardiovascular diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many unanswered questions exist, but the thinking is that “studying this more severe form of heart disease might be able to help us understand other common forms of heart disease,” says Nisha Parikh, MD, MPH, system director of the Women’s Heart Program for Northwell Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="caregivers-heavy-load" data-node-id="30" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="30.0"&gt;Caregivers’ Heavy Load &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Understanding takotsubo isn’t just about unpacking how our bodies biologically handle stress. It’s also about recognizing how a complex set of circumstances creates that stress in the first place. To put it simply, women move through the world differently than men, often facing specific social stressors in mid- to late life that men can more easily avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Women tend to experience a lot more stress around child-rearing. They have particularly high stress around job strain,” says Dr. Parikh. “And then even the stress of caregiving, loss of a spouse—all of that, we know, can affect women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As the U.S. population ages, research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/as-americas-population-ages-women-shoulder-the-burden-as-primary-caregivers" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/as-americas-population-ages-women-shoulder-the-burden-as-primary-caregivers" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="women make up" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;women make up&lt;/a&gt; the majority of unpaid caregivers and often bear the responsibility of caring for senior family members, even as they themselves age. Women also live longer than men on average, which means those in heterosexual relationships often outlive their partners, have more years to experience stressful life-changing events on their own, and can face a high risk of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2819153" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2819153" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="social isolation" data-node-id="33.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Grossman’s female heart patients at the Katz Institute often tell her they aren’t used to thinking about their own health because they’re so used to taking care of others. “For women, it can take a big toll when they’re reminded that they can’t do everything, that they need to slow down, they need to take care of themselves,” Grossman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="takotsubos-lasting-impact" data-node-id="36" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="36.0"&gt;Takotsubo’s Lasting Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The good news about takotsubo, initially, is that it’s considered a temporary condition—most people start to feel better within a few weeks, and the majority recover after a few months. But &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jchf.2018.10.009" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jchf.2018.10.009" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="more recent research shows" data-node-id="37.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;more recent research shows&lt;/a&gt; a substantial risk of both complications and death over the short and long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When Dr. Dawson began studying the syndrome around 2010 in Scotland, she found that even after the heart regained its normal, unswollen shape, some patients continued to have symptoms. “They were still fatigued. They were still getting chest pains. They were breathless, they had palpitations, they weren’t quite themselves,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So she started conducting clinical trials with people who’d experienced takotsubo at least one year prior. Not only were some still suffering symptoms, but their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841855/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841855/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="maximum exercise capability" data-node-id="39.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;maximum exercise capability&lt;/a&gt; was worse than that of a control group matched to their age, sex, and other health conditions. Patients also showed slightly abnormal biomarkers—metrics that tell physicians whether an organ is functioning properly—which led Dr. Dawson to find inflammation in the heart during takotsubo incidents as well as chronic, low-grade inflammation afterward.&lt;br data-node-id="39.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Perhaps most striking, the death rate for takotsubo survivors is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109724079713?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109724079713?via%3Dihub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="consistently similar" data-node-id="40.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;consistently similar&lt;/a&gt; to that of heart attack survivors, and just last year, researchers confirmed that patients whose original incident was triggered by a physical stressor often have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0914508725000097" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0914508725000097" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="worse health outcomes over time" data-node-id="40.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;worse health outcomes over time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-27" data-node-id="41" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="large" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-large embed css-uhpotl e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img draggable="true" alt="broken heart syndrome" title="broken heart syndrome" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125-an2025-brokenheart-003-689f896b937b2.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125-an2025-brokenheart-003-689f896b937b2.jpg?resize=980:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125-an2025-brokenheart-003-689f896b937b2.jpg?resize=2048:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125-an2025-brokenheart-003-689f896b937b2.jpg?resize=2048:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1gccgwy e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Florence Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Patients are eager for more of this information. Sheree, a 77-year-old physician in New Jersey who asked that &lt;em data-node-id="42.1"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt; use only her first name, experienced takotsubo syndrome nearly two years ago. Despite working in health care, she didn’t know much about it before she developed it herself. But when she told her daughter, a nurse, about her symptoms, her daughter guessed it was takotsubo right away—in part because Sheree was in the midst of an intense family conflict at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Now Sheree is back to hiking regularly, which makes her happy, but she’s still anxious for answers. And while Sheree has tried to read up on the condition to prepare herself for any potential future health challenges, there isn’t a lot out there. “I don’t know the long term,” she says. “What happens in the future?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="44" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Similarly, Corinne—a 73-year-old retired nurse anesthetist in Montana who experienced takotsubo syndrome about eight years ago during a period of stress when she and her husband were packing up their longtime home in Minnesota to move to Montana—is still not sure how it might affect her in the years to come. She has been able to go back to her normal routines, walking two to three miles outside each day, but also worries about possible effects later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“They weren’t terribly specific about anything I should be doing,” she says of her doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;On Reddit, Corinne and many other women are turning to each other for advice about ongoing symptoms. Multiple Facebook groups dedicated to takotsubo syndrome have thousands of members who discuss the condition and its mysteries. And while they provide reassurance that takotsubo survivors are not alone, concrete information is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="moving-toward-answers" data-node-id="48" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="48.0"&gt;Moving Toward Answers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="49" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Researchers say they’re unlikely to discover a one-size-fits-all treatment, but with so many medical groups focusing their efforts on takotsubo, there has been slow yet steady progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fourteen years ago, researchers in Switzerland launched the InterTAK Registry to study patient medical data from hospitals around the world and piece together a broader understanding of the condition. Thanks to their hard work, InterTAK now has info on more than 4,000 patients at 60 research centers in 19 countries. Smaller registries exist in the United States, including one at Cedars-Sinai, run by Dr. Bairey Merz, and another at NYU Langone Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="51" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In addition, Dr. Dawson has started the Scottish Takotsubo Registry, which she says is the first complete countrywide database of takotsubo patients, using Scotland’s national electronic health records to include every case diagnosed there going back to 2010. All these databases have significantly helped researchers paint a clearer picture of the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="52" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Using their growing pool of data, InterTAK researchers have developed a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2790718" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2790718" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="machine-learning model" data-node-id="52.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;machine-learning model&lt;/a&gt; designed to help doctors differentiate takotsubo from other acute coronary syndromes and properly diagnose it. The researchers are still validating it for routine clinical use, and the model would likely need to get FDA approval in the U.S., but Dr. Templin-Ghadri hopes that it can one day help doctors diagnose takotsubo faster and more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="53" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This past January, Dr. Dawson launched the world’s &lt;a href="https://dev.fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR157523" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://dev.fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR157523" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="first randomized clinical trial" data-node-id="53.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;first randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; testing a class of medications to see if they can prevent some post-takotsubo complications, including heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, repeat takotsubo episodes, and death. The drugs—renin-&lt;br data-node-id="53.3"&gt;angiotensin system inhibitors—relax blood vessels and are widely used to treat heart failure. They were the one treatment that had a slight association with reduced death in Dr. Dawson’s prior research, and she plans to start recruiting patients for the new trial this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="55" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“We’re starting with a known entity to see whether repurposing something that we’ve already got might give us the first step of help for these patients who are orphaned of any medication in their recovery,” Dr. Dawson says. She’s also working on studies that look at whether a prescribed exercise regimen or cognitive behavioral therapy could help people recovering from takotsubo. At the same time, researchers at NYU are testing the effectiveness of deep breathing for reducing stress and potentially lowering the risk of future heart problems in takotsubo patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="56" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, doctors are fighting an uphill battle if they can’t properly pinpoint what causes takotsubo in the first place. So Dr. Bairey Merz and her team at Cedars-Sinai are using their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666602222000039" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666602222000039" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="patient registry" data-node-id="56.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;patient registry&lt;/a&gt; to try to find answers to this key question by mapping the biological, demographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics of those who have experienced takotsubo syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="57" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Just as people with lighter skin and eyes are more likely to get a sunburn, Dr. Bairey Merz says people who experience takotsubo syndrome seem to have certain protein patterns (the sequence of amino acids within protein molecules) that may make them more susceptible to these stress hormones. The research is still very new: Her team just &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11422094/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11422094/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="published a study last fall" data-node-id="57.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;published a study last fall&lt;/a&gt; that found two abnormality patterns in the way patients’ heart muscles worked during their initial takotsubo incident, which were associated with some increased risk of recurrence. More studies are in the works to explore these patterns further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="59" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The pie in the sky would be that someday we would be able to recognize anyone at risk for a takotsubo,” says Dr. Bairey Merz. “I don’t know that we’re going to be able to prevent all takotsubos. But once someone’s had one, how do we prevent recurrence? That’s the goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="60" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Two years after her diagnosis, Zoslocki mostly feels better, but she’s still adjusting to life post-takotsubo and hoping scientists find more information soon. She’s made up with her sister and has been dutifully undergoing an echocardiogram twice a year as her doctor recommended. But at an appointment in February, the echo showed that her heart’s left ventricle still wasn’t quite back to its normal strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="61" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Zoslocki tells all her friends about her experience so they know what to watch for. “You have to be very vigilant,” she says. She wishes she had more answers and actionable steps to protect her heart. The medical advice on how to keep her stress low (don’t watch the news, for example) is tough to follow. “I wish I knew more,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="62" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hopefully, thanks to the hard work of doctors and researchers across the globe, Zoslocki won’t have to wait too long.&lt;br data-node-id="62.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-doctors-tell-takotsubo-survivors" data-node-id="64" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="64.0"&gt;What Doctors Tell Takotsubo Survivors &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="65" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These four steps are key for recurrence prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="66" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="66.0"&gt;1. Follow up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="67" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Your best protection? Taking whatever meds your physician recommends and &lt;br data-node-id="67.1"&gt;returning for all scheduled checkups. Follow-up appointments are particularly important so that the doctor can monitor your progress after the first phase of recovery and catch any complications on the early side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="68" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="68.0"&gt;2. Find your zen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="69" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Managing your stress level can help with recovery and potentially reduce the risk of future heart problems, doctors say. Therapists can help you avoid internalizing stressful situations. Other techniques, such as spending time in nature and deep-breathing exercises, have been shown to offer physiological benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="70" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="70.0"&gt;3. Reach out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="71" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You may have low energy levels or difficulty exercising for several months after takotsubo, which can be frustrating and isolating. Cardiologists recommend support groups focused on takotsubo or on heart conditions more broadly, which can connect people with similar experiences and help them learn relaxation strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="72" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="72.0"&gt;4.

But according to the acid reflux dietician, drinking too much water too quickly, especially at meal times can also exacerbate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sip slowly—especially during meals. Think gentle hydration, not flooding your stomach,' she advised her followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Aim to hydrate between meals instead of right before or right after eating,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst drinking a glass of water with a meal is unlikely to have a negative impact for most people, it can make acid reflux symptoms worse because it increases the overall volume of the stomach's contents—putting pressure on the valve that stops stomach acid from flowing back up the oesophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kitty Broihier, a registered dietician and mindful eating instructor, drinking water with a big meal can add to stomach distension and a bloated feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that gastric distension—often referred to as bloating—increases the amount of stomach acid reaching the esophageal sphincter, and forces acidic stomach juices to come back up, causing a burning sensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the online publication &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://foodguides.com/blogs/from-the-experts/why-water-might-be-causing-your-heartburn-the-science-behind-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Food Guides&lt;/a&gt;, she warned: 'As good as water is for you, it's apparent that drinking a lot of water at once will make the distention worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The same goes for drinking water during a meal,' she added. 'Don't wait until the evening to compensate for not drinking enough water during the day.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;br&gt;It always best to drink room temperature water, Ms Pelletier added, because water at this temperature can be absorbed more easily by the body, and is comfortably consumed without causing thermal shock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're still dealing with reflux despite doing "everything right", hydration habits might be one of the missing pieces,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may be able to advise on lifestyle changes or prescribe medication and investigations to combat the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But left untreated acid reflux can lead to a condition called Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a condition which triggers some of the cells in the oesophagus to grow abnormally—increasing the risk of oesophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as doctors warned earlier this year that millions may be hooked on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce the amount of acid in the stomach, limiting the distressing symptoms of heartburn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when patients stop taking the tablets, which include omeprazole and lansoprazole, the reflux returns even worse than before, experts have said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) estimates between 3 and 13 per cent of Barrett's oesophagus will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translate to someone with the condition having an 11-times greater risk of being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer than someone without Barrett's oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, CRUK estimates about three in five of the near 9,500 cases of oesophageal cancer diagnosed in Britain each year are preventable. By 2040, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15035953/cancer-research-uk-shock-report-risk.html"&gt;experts predict&lt;/a&gt; there will be 147,000 cases of oesophageal cancer in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:47:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOanhya0E5ZUNSZXdwUW5DWkg4eHAzc2dFNGdSeDN2LUF0Q1R0ekEwU3djWDdydXptd1VvbzBJcXRFN2xjX3BrZ1pBTndNLUlyeGU5aF9lU2RkT2pOcFBqZGRQMGpPNVZ0SlprS2lMSU5JYjRlVi1GbW1QUGFsOHZxSXozOWdXbVlRVkUySGR3QXh4RUnSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnpmNF9oU3EwWThpUWV2NHF4UXYwOUdiZXJNeEhKWjdUOWVoM2V6UTA4WlNrUC1HRS1PLXU2dHJxREtrUU0xcFlnRWMwUDd1QVVjWFpiT016cjlWbURBT3RjN3dqNHF3R3RZMnlxVHgwQTJSWG02dDZEUnRRTFI1NzNmSy1BbHFMSkpEelFRX094SV9yMFJVdWc</guid></item><item><title>糖替代品对大脑健康没有那么好- Medscape</title><link>https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/sugar-substitutes-not-so-sweet-brain-health-2025a1000nes</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming low- and no-calorie artificial sweeteners may harm cognitive function, results of a longitudinal study of middle-aged and older adults showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adjusted analyses, people who consumed the highest total amounts of these sweeteners had a 62% faster decline in overall thinking and memory skills, equivalent to about 1.6 years of aging, than those consuming the lowest amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link was found in people younger than 60 years but not in older adults and was stronger in people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For neurologists, the key message is that dietary exposures in midlife may impact long-term brain health, and artificial sweeteners may not be the harmless alternatives to sugar that many assume,” study author Claudia Kimie Suemoto, MD, PhD, with University of São Paulo in São Paulo, Brazil, told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important to keep in mind when counseling patients, especially those at higher risk for dementia or those with diabetes who often rely heavily on these products,” Suemoto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published online&lt;/a&gt; on September 3 in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Consumption, Faster Decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is the largest and longest prospective study to date investigating the association between artificial sweetener consumption and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While previous research had linked sweeteners to conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/286759-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, their long-term impact on cognition had not been systematically explored,” Suemoto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 12,772 adults participating in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health Brazilian. As part of the study, they underwent standard cognitive tests every 4 years across three study waves (2008-2010, 2012-2014, and 2017-2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A food frequency questionnaire was used to calculate combined and individual consumption of seven low- and no-calorie sweeteners, including the artificial sweeteners aspartame, saccharin, and acesulfame-K; the sugar alcohols erythritol, &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/sorbitol-342033" class="cl_ref_drugs"&gt;sorbitol&lt;/a&gt;, and xylitol; and tagatose, a natural sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were divided into three groups based on the total amount of sweeteners consumed. The lowest group consumed an average of 20 mg/d and the highest group consumed an average of 191 mg/d. For aspartame, this amount is equal to one can of diet soda. Sorbitol had the highest consumption, with an average of 64 mg/d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the overall sample, after a median follow-up of 8 years, participants in the two highest tertiles of combined low- and no-calorie sweetener consumption had a 35% and 62% higher rate of decline in global cognition, respectively, than peers in the lowest tertile. That corresponds to an excess 1.3 and 1.6 years of cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal fluency also suffered, with participants in the two highest tertiles of combined low- and no-calorie sweetener consumption showing 110% and 173% higher rates of decline in verbal fluency decline, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Consequences for Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analyses stratified by age, consumption of low- and no-calorie sweeteners was associated with faster decline in global cognition and verbal fluency in those younger than 60 years but not in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between higher intake of low- and no-calorie sweeteners was more pronounced in people with diabetes, particularly for memory decline, suggesting a heightened vulnerability in this group, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar positive associations with cognitive decline were found in analyses looking at consumption of all of the individual low- and no-calorie sweeteners — except for tagatose, the only natural sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the need to look more critically at what we are using to replace sugar in our diets, and they underscore that dietary choices in midlife can have consequences for brain health decades later,” Suemoto told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who love diet sodas and other sugar-free products (including myself), our findings do not mean that people should panic, but they do suggest it is wise to limit consumption as much as possible, ideally avoiding daily use. Whenever possible, choose natural options to add flavor, like fruit, honey, or spices, and try to shift toward a more balanced diet rich in whole foods,” Suemoto advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that not all artificial sweeteners were included (such as sucralose). And while a validated food frequency questionnaire was used, the possibility of misreporting bias cannot be ruled out. Also, diet was assessed only at baseline, which may reflect diet changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Compelling’ Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in a &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214129" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;linked editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas Monroe Holland, MD, with Rush Institute for Healthy Aging, Rush Medical College, Chicago, said the findings are “compelling” and add to “mounting evidence that common dietary exposures, particularly ultraprocessed food additives, once considered benign, may influence brain health in ways neurologists and other healthcare professionals are only beginning to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous research has linked artificially sweetened beverages to cognitive risk, the use of rigorous and advanced statistical techniques in this study “makes the results more accurate and less biased and strengthen our confidence in the observed cognitive associations,” Holland pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding that associations between these sweeteners and cognitive decline were strongest in younger adults has “profound implications for neurologic counseling. This suggests that midlife dietary exposures, decades before cognitive symptoms emerge, may carry life-long consequences for brain health,” Holland wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may prompt neurologists to reconsider standard dietary recommendations, particularly for patients with diabetes, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/165124-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, or cerebrovascular risk factors, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widespread assumption that low- and no-calorie sweeteners represent a safe sugar substitute may be “misguided, especially given their ubiquity in products marketed as ‘healthier’ alternatives,” Holland added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the medical community, this study poses a fundamental question: In our eﬀorts to prevent &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1916852-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and preserve cognition through dietary modification, are we inadvertently recommending substances that may accelerate the very cognitive decline we seek to prevent?” Holland concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This study was supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation; and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development. Suemoto and Holland had no relevant disclosures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOWUEyRUdtNzZIWjVZeWxzWTRWOTFlWlRUcGVFMUtPbXVCYVdWLWJRYzZzZGVVdE44S0tpazNQMFk1QnROVUZaSEtjQTBlS3c2Y0czTlhYNEkyY2Q5WkZNcVN1NVVaZkhYek1TMWg1Y25zcENXNmZmUEhTN2txWE5JY2wzY1QzSEJzZDE1ZjVGVi1SVkp6NE5EOA</guid></item><item><title>5个令人惊讶的迹象表明您可能正在心脏病发作-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/04/heart-attack-symptoms-surprising/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KGZEUYDVG5GMXBGMBSAQQQ27OA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One night, Lindsay Shanks sat up from bed and felt a sharp pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H7UBMEAAMJG6JBIPLXATZVJ534" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It felt like someone stabbed me right between my shoulder blades,” said Shanks, who was 37 at the time. “My hands started tingling, and I got really nauseous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:04:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPZHNLVm1hckljZnJOSmwtV0R0WjhrdnFjeVF2LVR0ZWxvaXhBN2REVEVwb2lYdzNrQk9LejU1QnR5blpUVTZrQlU5RUpqODZvcUl1dzN6WHN1VmRLNUxCd2VMMk9pUHhMR2NlQnlfZE00emVjbUs3LVMxRkhhOUVSU2VJRFhvZFJkUzJmdw</guid></item><item><title>肌酸补充剂是否就是他们想要的一切？ - NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5526053/are-creatine-supplements-all-that-theyre-pumped-up-to-be</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Creatine supplements have long been popular among iron-pumping gym bros. But these days, interest in creatine has exploded, as social media influencers tout the benefits of creatine for everything from adding muscle to boosting cognition and even helping to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's the supplement of the year," wellness influencer Bobby Parrish said in a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6pYXDyK/" target="_blank"&gt;recent TikTok post&lt;/a&gt;. "Creatine is legit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a compound&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-creatine/art-20347591#:~:text=Creatine%20is%20a%20%EE%80%80compound%20that%20comes%20from%20three" target="_blank"&gt; made&lt;/a&gt; from three amino acids that your muscles use as a source of energy. Your body makes some creatine, and it also comes from red meat, chicken or fish.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But can maximizing your creatine with supplements really deliver all the health benefits influencers claim? Here's what the research shows.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Creatine supplements can help grow muscle and improve athletic performance. Some claim it could prevent age-related bone and muscle loss, improve brain function when you're sleep deprived and boost cognition in other ways, or even protect against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Decades &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5469049/#Sec4" target="_blank"&gt;of research&lt;/a&gt; have shown that taking supplements to maximize the amount of creatine stored in muscles can help to add lean muscle mass and improve athletic performance, providing quick bursts of energy to "do a few extra reps on a bench press or finish a little bit stronger in a road race," says &lt;a href="https://exss.unc.edu/faculty-staff/abbie-smith/" target="_blank"&gt;Abbie Smith-Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And combining creatine with carbohydrates can help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132248/" target="_blank"&gt;boost endurance and speed recovery&lt;/a&gt; from a hard workout, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, you could increase your creatine stores by eating more, but "the problem with that is we're talking like 2 pounds of raw beef every day and not many people are willing to do that," says &lt;a href="https://healthsciences.nova.edu/faculty/human-performance/antonio-jose.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jose Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of exercise and sports science at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. Hence, supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to adding lean muscle mass, Antonio says the evidence for creatine supplements is "overwhelming." They work — but Antonio says there's a big caveat: "You can't just take creatine and then you put on lean mass." In other words, you actually have to work out.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A review of 35 studies found that when creatine supplements were combined with resistance training, adult men added around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35986981/" target="_blank"&gt;2 to 3 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of lean body mass. For older people especially — since we tend to lose muscle mass as we age — that could be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6921011/#:~:text=Collectively%2C%20the%20current%20literature%20allows%20us%20to,to%20prevent%20and%20treat%20frailty%20and%20sarcopenia" target="_blank"&gt;significant&lt;/a&gt;, Smith-Ryan says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also some newer research suggesting creatine supplements may help with bone health, though that evidence is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8756328222001442#:~:text=The%20current%20body%20of%20research,no%20exercise%20intervention%20is%20used." target="_blank"&gt;still emerging&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.pbrc.edu/news/media/2025/hannah_cabre_qa.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Hannah Cabre&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, exercise physiologist and postdoctoral fellow at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. She notes that exercise in general helps maintain healthy bones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Any time we're exercising, moving, lifting weights, the muscles are pulling on the bones, which is what actually increases their bone density. So if you're helping the muscle, you're also helping the bone," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for other potential benefits of creatine supplements — such as helping &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7915263/" target="_blank"&gt;regulate blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; in people with Type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11275561/" target="_blank"&gt;improving memory&lt;/a&gt;, helping the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9" target="_blank"&gt;brain function better when you're sleep deprived&lt;/a&gt; and boosting brain health in other ways? Antonio says the early evidence suggesting those benefits "isn't strong, but it's certainly interesting."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Smith-Ryan agrees. "I would say as a scientist, I would love more data." Still, she says, if you want to try creatine supplements, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Creatine is not going to be the magic bullet," she adds. "But I do think that it's a low-hanging fruit that has minimal side effects."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antonio notes that vegans and vegetarians are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7246861/" target="_blank"&gt;more likely to see a benefit from creatine supplementation&lt;/a&gt;, because they don't get as much, if any, creatine from their diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The nuance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you are taking creatine supplements to boost your performance at the gym or in the sports field, just know the boost might be small. "It's not going to make you necessarily a better baseball player or a better football player. But it will help you train harder," Antonio says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Creatine is considered very safe for adults, though if you have kidney disease, you should talk to your doctor before taking it, says &lt;a href="https://www.challiance.org/doctors/profile?n=7" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Pieter Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who researches supplement safety. He recommends buying supplements that contain creatine monohydrate — the most widely studied form — as the&lt;em&gt; only&lt;/em&gt; ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone wants to use supplements, we need to know exactly what ingredient we're getting and exactly the precise dose," Cohen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He notes that studies have found that products sold as preworkout sports supplements can often be adulterated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10570429/" target="_blank"&gt;prohibited ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. So he says if you do try a creatine supplement, make sure it's certified by a third-party certification program; he recommends &lt;a href="https://www.nsfsport.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NSF Certified for Sport&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cohen says while creatine supplements might mean the difference between winning and losing for a competitive athlete, "for recreational activities and certainly to stay healthy for the long term, I don't personally think there's a role for creatine that's been proven as of yet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And not everyone will see a difference in their performance after supplementing with creatine. Cohen points to &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2004/08000/ACUTE_CREATINE_MONOHYDRATE_SUPPLEMENTATION_.39.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;that suggests that, due to individual biological differences, as many as 20% to 30% of people won't respond to creatine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;If you want to try it&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are two strategies for getting started on creatine supplements for muscle-building benefits. One is what's called a loading dose, says Antonio, which involves taking 5 grams of creatine four times a day for seven days. This will quickly build up creatine stores in muscles, but might cause some gastrointestinal distress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why Antonio and Cabre both say they often recommend the second strategy, which is to take 5 grams of creatine daily. It will take longer for the creatine to saturate the muscles, so you need to take this daily dose for at least four and preferably eight weeks before noticing a difference in terms of lean muscle mass, says Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Once someone has been on creatine for a while, 3 to 5 grams a day is generally considered the maintenance dose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you want to try creatine, but you understand what the potential benefit is — that you might be able to do a heavy, repetitive activity a little faster and you choose to try it for that reason — that's reasonable," Cohen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, what and how much we eat tends to change. However, how meal timing relates to health remains less understood. Researchers at Mass General Brigham and their collaborators studied changes to meal timing in older adults and discovered people experience gradual shifts in when they eat meals as they age.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;They also found characteristics that may contribute to meal timing shifts and revealed specific trajectories linked to an earlier death. The results are published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01035-x" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status. Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+warning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early warning&lt;/a&gt; sign to look into underlying physical and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+issues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health issues&lt;/a&gt;," said lead author Hassan Dashti, Ph.D., RD, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Also, encouraging older adults to have consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promote healthy aging and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashti and his colleagues—including senior author Altug Didikoglu, MSc, Ph.D., of the Izmir Institute of Technology in Turkey—examined key aspects of meal timing that are significant for aging populations to determine whether certain patterns might signal, or even influence, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+outcomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt;, from 2,945 community-dwelling adults in the UK aged 42–94 years old who were followed for more than 20 years. They found that as older adults age, they tend to eat breakfast and dinner at later times, while also narrowing the overall time window in which they eat each day.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Later breakfast time was consistently associated with having physical and mental health conditions such as depression, fatigue and oral health problems. Difficulty with meal preparation and worse sleep were also linked with later mealtimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, later breakfast timing was associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up. Individuals genetically predisposed to characteristics associated with being a "night owl" (preferring later sleep and wake times) tended to eat meals at later times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Up until now, we had limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," said Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/timing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;timing&lt;/a&gt;, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;. These results add new meaning to the saying that 'breakfast is the most important meal of the day,' especially for older individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashti noted that this has important implications as time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting gain popularity, where the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+impacts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health impacts&lt;/a&gt; of shifting meal schedules may differ significantly in aging populations from those in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Walk into any hospital, nursing home, or senior care facility, and you’ll likely see them: small bottles of meal replacement shakes being handed out to patients as “nutrition support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571752 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0001-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0001.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closer look at what’s actually in these products reveals a troubling reality: many of these shakes contain ingredients that can worsen the very conditions they’re meant to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Institutional Shake Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a regular occurrence — seniors in hospitals or care facilities being given shakes that are essentially sugar water with a little protein thrown in,” says Joel Bikman, a nutrition expert who’s now dedicated his life to helping others make better lifestyle choices. “These products are handed out because they’re cheap, not because they’re what’s best for patient health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are staggering. A recent analysis of popular institutional meal replacement shakes found that many contain 15-25 grams of sugar per serving — more than a can of some popular soda pops. For seniors already struggling with diabetes, insulin resistance, or metabolic disorders, this can be particularly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Really Inside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sugar Problem – Many hospital-distributed shakes contain corn syrup, cane sugar, or fructose as primary ingredients. Research published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that high-sugar nutritional supplements can actually worsen glucose control in elderly patients, particularly those with existing diabetes or prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571753 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0002-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0002.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Additives – To extend shelf life and reduce costs, institutional shakes often contain artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. A 2021 study in Clinical Nutrition found that these additives can trigger inflammatory responses — particularly problematic for seniors whose immune systems are already compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Protein Quality – Many institutional shakes rely on soy protein isolate or other cheap protein sources that don’t provide complete amino acid profiles. For seniors fighting muscle loss (sarcopenia), this inadequate protein can actually accelerate decline rather than prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you get older, your need for protein to build and maintain needed muscle mass actually increases — up to double the amount currently recommended,” Bikman said. “The majority of aging adults are significantly below those recommended amounts — to their harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cost-vs-Health Equation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare institutions face budget pressures that often prioritize cost over nutritional quality. A premium, metabolically balanced shake might cost $3-4 per serving, while institutional options can be purchased for little more than a $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The irony is that giving patients this very poor-quality nutrition can actually extend hospital stays and worsen outcomes,” explains Bikman. “A patient who experiences blood sugar spikes and crashes simply isn’t going to recover as quickly as someone getting stable, balanced nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real-World Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact goes beyond individual patient health. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that seniors consuming high-sugar nutritional supplements showed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased inflammation markers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poorer glycemic control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher rates of digestive issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced appetite for actual meals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571754 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0003-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0003-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0003.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Seniors and Families Can Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by asking questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I see the ingredient list of this shake?”&lt;br&gt;
“What’s the sugar content?”&lt;br&gt;
“Are there artificial additives?”&lt;br&gt;
“Are there alternative options?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is if you need a meal replacement shake, simply bring your own. Many facilities allow patients to bring their own nutritional supplements. Look for shakes with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No added sugars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-quality protein sources (whey, egg, or collagen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal artificial ingredients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balanced macronutrients (roughly equal protein and healthy fats)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some progressive healthcare systems are beginning to recognize this problem. Kaiser Permanente and Mayo Clinic have started evaluating their nutritional supplement choices based on ingredient quality, not just cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wouldn’t accept substandard medications in hospitals,” notes Bikman. “Why should we accept substandard nutrition?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the overwhelming need for a truly healthy meal replacement shake that folks 60+ could consume each day, Bikman and his team of metabolic and nutrition experts decided to create the ideal solution: &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=MERIDIAN&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each shake features an optimized, science-backed blend of protein, collagen, healthy fats, apple cider vinegar, probiotics, fiber, vitamins and minerals – with no added sugar or any artificial ingredients,” said Bikman. “For most people, it’s easily the healthiest thing they’ll consume in the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-571755 lazyload" data-src="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0004-300x200.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0004-300x200.jpg 300w, https://latterdaysaintmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Breaking-1-HLTH_Code_2_0004.jpg 728w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bikman notes that thousands of people age 60 and over are using HLTH Code every day to look and feel better, and points to a few of their many 5-star reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m so glad to have found this product. Two words IT WORKS. I was recently diagnosed &amp;amp; have had to make major changes to my diet. Have this for breakfast everyday, Low glycemic index, calories to keep you full longer. Works well with losing weight &amp;amp; maintaining glucose levels,” Maria F. wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wear a continuous glucose monitor and can see that my blood glucose is steady-eddy, no spikes when I consume this shake,” Danalee J. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just what I have been looking for as a well-balanced good tasting meal replacement. Very quick and easy preparation with no clumping in the shake. This is the first shake that keeps me feeling full and sustained throughout my workday,” Gerald B. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So easy to mix and turn into a meal. Tastes great and nutritionally sound. I could just eat these for my meals and be fine,” Patrick I. stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This product is so good. I love the fact that I get 50% of the vitamins and minerals I need with each serving,” Sharon L. said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Satisfaction Guaranteed&lt;/h3&gt;

These include hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, depression, excessive alcohol consumption, hearing loss, and social isolation. Low educational attainment and poor sleep quality are also significant contributors. These factors often coexist and can amplify dementia risk. Managing these through lifestyle changes, such as regular physical activity, healthy diet, quitting smoking, controlling blood pressure and blood sugar, and maintaining social engagement, can reduce or delay dementia onset.

Because of the risks involved, doctors are often cautious about using drugs off-label, but in some circumstances, such as treating a rare disease, their use can offer a meaningful benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;off-label treatment included significant risks: difficulty breathing, a sudden drop in blood pressure, and significant neurologic toxicity causing confusion and delirium, said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Roberts. In some patients, the effects&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of the treatment&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are severe enough that they end up at the hospital’s intensive care unit. Another doctor knew of a patient who had died from the treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Off-label treatments should be pursued with caution, said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Dr. Sarimar Agosto Salgado, an oncologic endocrinologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla. Typically, she said, they should only be pursued in academic medical centers that can bring together experts from a variety of relevant fields. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But for many&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;people with rare diseases and limited treatments, a high-risk option can seem worth taking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When treating this type of cancer, there’s really not much for patients and prognoses are very poor,” said Roberts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "&gt;&lt;span class="caption | margin_right_half"&gt;Robb Jutton, 51, at Massachusetts General Hospital on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025. The Meredith, N.H., father of two went from needing a wheelchair due to stage 4 thyroid cancer to walking and playing cornhole with his family, thanks to an experimental treatment he's receiving at the Boston hospital.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit uppercase"&gt;Erin Clark/Globe Staff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When he met Jutton in April,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Roberts thought of a drug, tarlatamab, that was approved just last year to treat lung cancer. There was scant evidence of its effectiveness treating thyroid cancer, but Roberts thought it might work because of how it binds to a specific kind of protein present in both thyroid cancer and lung cancer. Working with colleagues in other departments, he had tried it off-label with a few of his patients to treat thyroid cancer and had good initial results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But there were issues with the drug’s toxicity. The adverse effect in one patient led to death, according to Dr. Mimi Hu, professor and deputy department chair of Clinical Affairs and the Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Hu reviewed Roberts’s preliminary findings, which he plans to present at a meeting of the American Thyroid Association in September. Hu said the off-label treatment is&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;promising and worthy of further study.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our patients deserve us coming to the table and further evaluating this possibility,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Roberts said he discussed using tarlatamab with Jutton. He told him that there were no established treatments for his stage of thyroid cancer and explained the risks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are a few sort of possibilities, kind of based on a tiny bit of data and a hunch,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For Jutton, that was enough to move forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re so on the cutting edge of what’s going on with medical science that there’s literally no data to rely on,” Jutton said. “They’re kind of using me as a guinea pig to learn how this stuff is working.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cancer had stolen Jutton’s life. Once a bass player in a heavy metal band, Jutton started feeling extreme fatigue in January 2024. By May 2024 he was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer, an extremely rare form of thyroid cancer with only about &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22873-medullary-thyroid-cancer-mtc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;1,000 diagnoses a year&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He began conventional treatment in New Hampshire in June 2024, taking an FDA-approved medication, called &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-selpercatinib-medullary-thyroid-cancer-ret-mutation" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;selpercatinib&lt;/a&gt;, that stops cancer from growing by blocking certain proteins. But by December, the cancer was growing quickly again, and Jutton was getting weaker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It was basically like him just laying in a hospital bed waiting to die,” said his wife, Corrine Jutton.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton was referred to Massachusetts General Hospital for treatment. There, he met Roberts, who gave him the option of trying an experimental treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Roberts said when treating a rare cancer, he tries to figure out if it would be possible to repurpose a treatment from a more common cancer, focusing on biology. He thought of tarlatamab for Jutton because it binds to a protein called DLL3 — a protein that is present on both lung cancer cells and thyroid cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The treatment is a type of immunotherapy. Y-shaped antibodies bind to the DLL3 protein in the cancer with one “arm” and to a T cell with the other, allowing the T cells to do what they’re supposed to do: kill the cancer cells, Roberts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It seemed like an encouraging therapeutic option in patients that were out of options,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

He no longer needed the opioids he had previously taken several times a day, his wife said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From that moment on, he had no more pain, whereas the last year and a half has been a build up of worsening pain,” Corrine Jutton said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He started to regain energy, and now he’s able to once again do activities from the mundane, like mowing the lawn, to the momentous, such as attending his daughter’s high school graduation — a special moment he thought he might not see. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s miraculous, as far as I’m concerned,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton has been able to access the treatment at no cost to his family under a financial assistance program,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;said Roberts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other doctors who treat medullary thyroid cancer said the tarlatamab treatment has promise, but urged further study to understand and limit the potentially severe side effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hu said Roberts’s results raise questions of whether thyroid patients might need a different dose of tarlatamab than lung cancer patients. She said a study could be designed to expand access to the treatment, and also investigate how patients might respond to it if it’s administered earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Salgado called the innovative approach to advanced thyroid cancer “promising.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, she said, more study and data areneeded about the drug’s potential toxicity. Until then, Salgado said she would not recommend the treatment to the general medical community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I am encouraged of how we can bring promising therapies to patients through collaboration between expert teams, patients, and industry to continue moving forward the field,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jutton does not know how much longer he’ll survive his cancer. He said he plans to keep taking the treatment as long as he can, whether that’s for another 30 years or another two weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He hopes his experience can be used to help others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If this crappy experience can make anything better for anyone coming behind me, then there’s a silver lining in it, as far as I’m concerned,” said Jutton. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Propranolol blocks adrenaline’s effects, so those physical symptoms chill out. It kicks in within ~30–60 minutes and lasts a few hours, or up to a week if you're on it regularly. But here’s the catch: it only tames the body’s reaction. The mental jitters—the thoughts like “what if I mess up?”—are still alive and well.&lt;br&gt;Think high-pressure, short-term moments:&lt;br&gt;Speaking at weddings (yes, even the bride-in-waiting might ask her nurse about it)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First dates&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Job interviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big presentations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stage performances (musicians, actors—you name it) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's usually prescribed for high blood pressure and other heart problems, but it can also help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, like sweating and shaking," NHS UK says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 05:53:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
