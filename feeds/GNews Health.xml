To help, her husband, John Briggs, created a spreadsheet with rows for ashwagandha, Omega-3 and curcumin extract. There was ginseng, lion’s mane mushroom and the antioxidant liposomal glutathione, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs, 64, had started taking the supplements last July, a daily regimen that grew to include 34 capsules and tablets along with two scoops of powder. When it became too much, Mr. Briggs began blending them into a shake, to which he added brown food coloring so it looked less like its natural “sickly” olive shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs was taking them all because a doctor had told her that with enough supplements and lifestyle modifications, her Alzheimer’s symptoms could not only be slowed, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It is an idea that has become the focus of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/title-2538046" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;television specials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://youtu.be/UyneMnERmnI?si=5JHTmPvmph-Qim_0&amp;amp;t=8760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;popular podcasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://drtalks.com/summit/reverse-alzheimers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;; the sell behind mushroom supplements and self-help books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the suggestion that Alzheimer’s can be reversed through lifestyle adjustments has outraged doctors and scientists in the medical establishment, who have repeatedly said that there is little to no proof for such a claim, and expressed concern that the idea could harm a large group of vulnerable Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Briggs had come across the idea after learning about Dale Bredesen, who had been performing a series of small and unconventional studies through which he claimed to have designed a set of guidelines to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

              &lt;p&gt;A family vacation to Costa Rica turned sour after 12 of 13 relatives developed symptoms of a fungal lung infection following an excursion through bat-filled caves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In season two of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the cordyceps fungus—spoiler alert—becomes airborne, meaning the fungal infection can spread not just through bites but also when humans inhale its spores. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7417a1.htm"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24811-histoplasmosis"&gt;histoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone—except the one family member who hadn’t toured the cave—became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Five family members sought medical attention. Doctors tested four of them for fungal infections, and two tested positive for histoplasma. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. Notably, the cave they had visited had also likely caused a histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998 and 1999.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame,” the team, led by CDC researchers, wrote in the report. “However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.” In other words, given that it’s harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies—or had lung cancer—and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/histoplasmosis/treatment#:~:text=Most%20cases%20of%20histoplasmosis%20go,infection%20and%20your%20immune%20status."&gt;go away&lt;/a&gt; on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to “consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,” they concluded. In collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health, the CDC hopes to see the risk of histoplasmosis included in the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising that &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski—author of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8205437-there-s-a-grain-of-truth-in-every-fairy-tale-love"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that “there’s a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzfd000o3b77gnanjc6t@published"&gt;I am a gay man, and discovered a Fleshlight in my husband’s underwear drawer while I was putting some of his clothes away a few days ago. When I confronted him about it, he said a (female) friend of his gave it to him as a joke for April Fool’s Day, and he just wanted to “try it out.” We have an active and fulfilling sex life (or at least I thought). Do I have reason to be concerned that I may not be enough for him, or worse, that he may have needs I can’t satisfy?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzjr000r3b778dpii073@published"&gt;The implications of your question trouble me. Do you think your husband is not entitled to self-pleasure? Would you be similarly offended to learn that he uses his … &lt;em&gt;hand&lt;/em&gt; to masturbate? How much control over his sexuality do you think you’re entitled to? You’re gay, so surely you’re aware of the widespread practice of open relationships within your tribe, right? Plenty of relationships survive not only their constituent partners masturbating, but partners having sex with other people, sometimes in large group settings. That’s enough to make a Fleshlight look about as threatening to a relationship as a flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzl4000s3b770qtsoeww@published"&gt;People seek pleasure from sources other than their primary partner for a number of reasons. Yeah, it may have something to do with dissatisfaction, but it just as easily might not. If you are indeed in a monogamous relationship, and I assume so given your reaction to your husband having sex with an inanimate object, maybe all he wants is some variety. People like novelty, and masturbating, even with a toy, is a way to experience it. You are better off going with your gut and what your husband tells you. If you think your sex life is active and fulfilling, it probably is. Unless you are oblivious to signs, you would know if there were an issue. Your husband likely has a healthy libido and an adventurous mind.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that you do satisfy plenty already. No one can be everything. In the future, instead of confronting your husband over something that intimidates you sexually, you should express curiosity. What does he like about that object and why? Is there anything he’d like to try that the two of you aren’t doing? If you went as far as to ask him to incorporate the Fleshlight in your sex life, you’d be showing him the kind of acceptance that will likely make him comfortable communicating about such things. That could take the mystery out of the situation and make it so you don’t have to wonder if you should be concerned or whether you’re fulfilling his needs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001m3b772i8m3ihc@published"&gt;Mike’s birthday was nearly a month ago, and Rachel and I decided the threesome would be the perfect surprise. The trouble was, when the moment came, Mike COULD NOT get it up, which is completely unusual for him. No matter what we tried, he remained a limp noodle. Needless to say, everyone ended up sorely disappointed. But that isn’t the worst of it. Ever since then, my husband hasn’t been able to achieve an erection. I’ve suggested going to see a urologist, but Mike is so embarrassed and depressed that he refuses. Now I’m scared we’ll never have sex again! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001p3b778aixvx8n@published"&gt;Maybe you start by letting Mike know that what he experienced is not uncommon at all. For as much as he wanted the threesome, and as much pleasure as it seemed to promise, years of fantasizing were leading up to that moment. That alone can make for a pressurized situation that promotes performance anxiety. Possibly compounding the situation was that you sprung it on him. You and Rachel had the best intentions for doing so and reason to assume that it would go in a mutually satisfying direction, but it didn’t. Anxiety, period, is a huge boner killer, and one can get stuck in a cycle of worrying about not getting hard, not being hard, and then worrying more about how it’s coming across. It can be difficult to break that cycle, no matter how hot the situation or even how affirming one’s partners are. It certainly helps when the partner(s) don’t buy into the anxiety or pressure, but there’s no guarantee that shrugging it off will actually help. Expressions of “sore” disappointment, though, almost certainly make an already fraught situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="257" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94h001q3b77n5l4r5nu@published"&gt;Erectile dysfunction drugs, in addition to opening up vessels and getting the blood flowing, can work as anti-anxiety meds. Knowing you have a little bit of extra lift can abate some of that nervousness and make it easier to perform. It might be that your husband doesn’t have much experience with PDE5 inhibitors since you report that his limpness during your failed threesome was “completely unusual for him.” (Granted, he may have discreetly popped a Viagra or Cialis in the past that you weren’t aware of.) If he has no experience with these drugs, he should get a prescription—they could be a game changer, and they’re easy enough to obtain online with minimal provider contact. I don’t necessarily condone having minimal contact with a provider, but it’s clear that a lot of guys are embarrassed about this stuff, and don’t like visiting the doctor regardless of the issue, so telehealth companies like Hims and Ro are taking a lot of the discomfort out of the process. Yeah, going to a urologist could help Mike—what you describe sounds like a circumstantial ED issue that has psychological roots, but hearing from a doctor that Mike isn’t broken and this issue is fixable could make a big difference. Still, if the guy won’t go, you can’t make him. Maybe you wait it out a bit more, let the problem remain persistent, and Mike may drop his resistance to the doctor. For a non-medical intervention in the meantime, he could try a cock ring. It’s not foolproof, but it may help.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94n001s3b77u1s9fgaa@published"&gt;My sister has been complaining about her inability to find a decent guy and her lack of luck on the dating scene. I work in an adult entertainment shop, and decided to use my employee discount to get her a super-realistic dildo for her birthday last week. Instead of being grateful, she got angry and accused me of thinking she “couldn’t get a man.” Did I act incorrectly?&lt;/p&gt;

Your sister wasn’t necessarily asking for a solution to her problem, just for your ear and compassion. It sounds like she is more on the emotional side, while you lean pragmatic. It makes a certain kind of sense that you bought her a sex toy, given her issues, and I’m sure you meant well. But you did this, by your own admission, because of her dating problems. She reacted emotionally, but a version of, “You bought this for me because I couldn’t get a man,” is the truth. The gift may have, in fact, reminded her of her dating frustrations primarily, so much so that it didn’t have a shot at ameliorating her sexual ones—if she even has those! She may not be having issues finding sex, or she may already have sex toys she uses and likes, rendering the potential usefulness of your gift moot.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s really never a safe bet to give someone a sex toy, unless you’re intimately involved with them and know they like them. Did you act incorrectly? Well, kinda. I think your intentions were pure, but not necessarily well thought out, and when it comes to giving gifts, it really is the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

I also haven’t been on a date. My life has pretty much been surrounded by doctors and hospitals as I learn to cope with chronic illness. But I’m at a point now where I’d like to date and maybe have sex again. But I don’t know where to start. I’m submissive, and this might sound weird, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/sexual-fantasy-smell-sex-advice.html"&gt;but the absolute most important thing is they have to smell “right.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers are discovering this is especially true of female brains, which get remodeled significantly during the three Ps: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/teen-tween-developing-brains-wellness/index.html"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt; (as do the brains of adolescent males), pregnancy and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/07/health/menopause-effect-brain-gupta-wellness"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            All three transitions are a frequent butt of pop-culture jokes: the  sulky, risk-taking teenager who only wants to be with friends; the scattered mom-to-be who leaves her cell phone in the fridge and can’t remember where she parked the car; and the hormonal middle-aged woman who can’t focus and spontaneously combusts with hot flashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000f3b6mdfseylyx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But far from being laughable, these behavioral stereotypes are the external manifestations of big internal shifts, many of them linked to the effects of fluctuating hormones on the brain.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000g3b6md9args8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive neuroscientist Laura Pritschet, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is fascinated by how female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, affect the brain’s organization and functioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000h3b6m7fpfz720@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad, interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things,” Pritschet told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000i3b6m7u79h7fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the same time in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues,” she said. “I thought we’ve got to connect these two together and understand this more.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000j3b6meb58bn78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet even volunteered as a “guinea pig” during graduate school, having her brain scanned and blood drawn for 30 days, across two complete reproductive cycles (both on and off birth control pills), to begin to answer the question of how the day-to-day fluctuations in hormones relate to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8975130/" target="_blank"&gt;day-to-day changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000k3b6m9s4axi0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around this time, other researchers were studying what happens in the brain during pregnancy, Pritschet said, looking at the brain before and after gestation. They found many changes, but because the studies took a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27991897/" target="_blank"&gt;snapshot approach&lt;/a&gt;, many questions were left unanswered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000l3b6mnr7gqlf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s a 3 to 5% decrease in total gray matter volume, when is that occurring (during pregnancy), and how is it occurring?” Pritschet asked. “We’re missing huge gaps in what we call this metamorphosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000m3b6m5d3ucroc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus: We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption,” she said. “What does this trajectory look like over gestation?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000n3b6m4tqk9xla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To find out, Pritschet and her team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/how-pregnancy-changes-brain-study-wellness"&gt;tracked the brain changes&lt;/a&gt; in one woman, using MRI and blood draws, from pre-conception and fertility treatment throughout her pregnancy to two years postpartum. Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01741-0" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

            “We saw this reduction in gray matter volume pretty much across the whole brain,” Pritschet explained. “We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size.” (Quick anatomy lesson: The brain is made up of gray and white matter. Gray matter is where most of the brain’s thinking and processing takes place. White matter helps connect the different brain areas, allowing them to communicate with one another.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000v3b6mchlf1wko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The inflection point was birth,” Pritschet said. “We saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum, with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in gray matter volume in early postpartum. Others did not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000w3b6mfgdmmeob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet said this “choreographed dance between major features of our brain” is in one respect a physical adaptation to the increased blood flow and swelling that comes with pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000x3b6mpj8vykm0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the changes  may also be a preparation for the next stage: parenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000y3b6mlbxtaxxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a fine-tuning of circuits,” she explained. “We know that pregnancy is the lead-up to this time in your life where there’s a lot of behavioral adaptation that has to occur, and new cognitive demands, and a new cognitive load.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000z3b6m5rjtc4sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient to meet the demands that are going to have to occur,” Pritschet said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00103b6mrusx1xhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This theory is supported by earlier work. “The first pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume — that sort of reduction — correlated with various … maternal behaviors (such as bonding). Again, that’s all correlation,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00113b6my42uf1re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context,” she said. “But you can expect that if there’s fine-tuning in these circuits that underlie cognitive or behavioral process, that the more fine-tuning it undergoes, the better performance you’re going to have. That’s the idea — but it’s so much more complicated than that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00123b6mnqa8qzmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;hat    happens to the brain during pregnancy? Pritschet offers these three insights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00133b6mwxox03ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body is the outward sign of a lot of inner upheaval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00143b6m5rfnesmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pregnancy is a transformative time in a person’s life where the body undergoes rapid physiological adaptations to prepare for motherhood,” Pritschet said via email. “But pregnancy doesn’t just transform the body — it also triggers profound change to the brain and reflects another critical period of brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00153b6msg6kzdpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She called this remodeling   an often-overlooked period of brain development that takes place well into a woman’s adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00163b6mr79by7ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Less gray matter may not sound very positive, but it happens for a reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00173b6mfyywoaz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite what one might think, these reductions are not a bad thing, and in fact, are to be expected,” Pritschet said, noting that some of the losses are eventually regained. “This change could indicate a ‘fine-tuning’ of brain circuits, not unlike what happens to all young adults as they transition through puberty and their brain becomes more specialized.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00183b6miv7xuri0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These changes could also be a response to the high physiological demands of pregnancy itself, she said, “showcasing just how adaptive the brain can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmax6wc6d001e3b6mnfyb8w86@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="these-changes-could-affect-future-health-and-behavior" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        These changes could affect future health and behavior
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00193b6m9csq3658@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mapping these changes could open the door to understanding an array of other neurological and behavioral outcomes including postpartum depression, headaches, migraines, epilepsy, stroke and parental behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001a3b6ma4tqkavx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The neuroanatomical changes that unfold during (pregnancy) have broad implications for understanding vulnerability to mental health disorders … and individual differences in parental behavior,” said Pritschet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001b3b6mkcyjtpwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may even provide critical insight into how the brain changes over a lifespan, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The scan, which takes just 8 minutes, detects brain lesions centered on veins—a hallmark of MS—using a technique called T2*-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers introduced a simple diagnostic guideline known as the “rule of six,” confirming MS if six vein-centered lesions are found. This method not only improves patient comfort and reduces diagnostic delays but could also save healthcare systems millions by reducing hospital stays and complications from lumbar punctures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The 8-minute MRI replaces the need for painful lumbar punctures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Rule of Six’:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding six vein-centered brain lesions confirms MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost and Time Savings:&lt;/strong&gt; Could save the NHS up to £5 million annually and speed up diagnosis by 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts from the University of Nottingham have proven that multiple sclerosis (MS) can successfully be diagnosed using an MRI scan, meaning patients no longer need to undergo a painful lumbar puncture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScuSf_jfL6tpUonbgB2vU9Gt3cvT52lVHXbtlWkFn0OAuJdnIUBEX7va0nHL8K2ld_hegOT7p2IwyyZRxdGHhTg-w2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScIpMCJLRFmrDuBtNOkBwr2LXYTSqoOGghZrcfqqiQodlMYO_1SFiU7aVsJj6OSE02gEj_5nj0h-f8eIFCJHjy5aA2"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology, experts from the School of Medicine found that by using a new MRI scan, they could successfully diagnose MS in 8 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110232"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide the NHS with a scientific approach to diagnosing MS which is safer, more cost effective and more importantly acceptable to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS is a neurological condition which affects around 150,000 people in the UK. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it has many symptoms but not all sufferers experience all of them and the disease can progress at different rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no agreement on the best way to diagnose MS. Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a lumbar puncture, where a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often report they find it painful, and it can cause unintended complications requiring hospitalisation or time off work to recover. Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities are not found in everyone who has MS. Some people with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar puncture abnormalities. Both problems can lead to misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the study, Professor Nikos Evangelou, Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University said: “More than half of all people diagnosed with MS in the UK have had at least one lumbar puncture, following the suspicion of MS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of our research are particularly exciting as we have now shown that we can give the diagnosis of MS without this painful procedure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a clinical MRI scanner, of the type all neuroscience centres have, to carry out a special type of scan called a T2*-weighted MRI which is able to reveal lesions in the brain’s white matter that are centred on a vein &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; a known indicator of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a conclusive diagnosis of MS, the team developed the ‘rule of six’, whereby if there were six lesions found with a central vein, this confirmed a diagnosis of MS without having to analyse all lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out a prospective study, in Nottingham, Cardiff and London with patients who had a suspected, but not definite diagnosis of MS. Each patient was given an 8-minute MRI scan and a lumbar puncture and after 18 months, they were able to find out what the diagnosis was and whether it matched that of their initial scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this study and previous research conducted in Nottingham and in the USA the International Committee for the diagnosis of MS, recently announced that the MRI scan, as first proposed by the Nottingham research team, is enough to diagnose MS. A lumbar puncture is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Evangelou adds: “Not only will our findings have huge benefits for patients, but it will also mean cost savings for the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have lumbar punctures are required to spend at least most of a day in hospital, and for a health service already at capacity, this creates more issues. If there are complications with the lumbar puncture the stay can be longer. With the MRI scan, it takes 8 minutes, is completely safe, and then you can go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, we think we will reach the diagnosis three months earlier and the change could save the NHS up to five million pounds each year, which can be reinvested in better services for our MS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this MS and neuroimaging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97f4fff6e5fbf8e3e3f2b9e0f6fbfbd7f9f8e3e3fef9f0fff6fab9f6f4b9e2fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Nikos Evangelou et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central vein sign (CVS) describes the presence of venules within multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions, visible on T2*-weighted MRI. In the upcoming revision of the MS diagnostic criteria, the simplified “rule of 6” (i.e., finding 6 lesions with a central venule) can support the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to lumbar puncture (LP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated whether a T2*-weighted MRI scan is more sensitive than oligoclonal bands (OCBs) for diagnosing MS at presentation with a typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). We also compared the tolerability of LP and the additional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants requiring an LP to meet the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS were enrolled in this multicenter, prospective, diagnostic superiority study from 3 UK neuroscience centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A six-minute T2*-weighted sequence was used to assess the CVS using 2 definitions: a 40% threshold of all eligible lesions and the rule of 6. These were compared with OCBs, using the clinical diagnosis at 18 months as the reference standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 113 participants, 99 (mean age: 38, female: 73%) have completed all study activities: 80 were diagnosed with MS, 10 remained CIS, 8 had alternative diagnoses, and 1 remained without a diagnosis. No significant difference in diagnostic sensitivity was detected between 40% CVS threshold (90% [CI 81%–96%]) and OCB testing (84% [CI 74%–91%]) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.332).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule of 6 had a sensitivity of 91% (CI 83%–96%). Side effects were reported by 75% following LP compared with 9% following MRI. All participants preferred their MRI scan over their LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS and OCB testing is equally sensitive in supporting the diagnosis of MS in cases of typical CIS. CVS assessed using the 40% threshold, and the simpler rule of 6 produces equivalent diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with OCB testing, CVS testing seems safer and better tolerated by patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate CVS specificity, particularly outside of typical CIS cases, as studied here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Classification of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides Class IV evidence that CSF OCBs and the CVS are equally sensitive in supporting a diagnosis of MS in patients presenting with CIS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:24:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5zVkhQZ1dDMFI3V2dLOUMwSVBZOEhUQ2VhUHU5T29jTHEtNmpwcGV0Vy1xb1dvSTdLWW1STHZoZzc4ZENQbWdsTW9kNktmSjU5dFpBbU11VUhQWjFZQ2hSb2RxaEV3QQ</guid></item><item><title>优于Ozempic ：科学家揭示最有效的减肥药物- SciTechDaily | Better Than Ozempic: Scientists Reveal Most Effective Weight Loss Drug - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:06:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ</guid></item><item><title>官员警告说，在大都会人寿体育场举行的夏奇拉音乐会上潜在的麻疹暴露- NBC新闻 | Officials warn of potential measles exposure at Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSnBLSWlOTzVnYl85U3IzR3lVNmhZQ0JMNm16cllyY1BvSGZfS0J5TFB2UGZpSHF0OWhRTHFfc0Fyblh5b3c0a0tKN011ZUdGYmxKNzc5MWlwYlFMazJpcWJhWUFmSjVOS1Y1WEdBWWJxOFBhTFJtdmtpSHVjaVJweU5iLTZYTGVyeW05Qm1KLWZnNnNBX05vRmtsVVVRU2fSAVZBVV95cUxOcXMtTGhHSnZCUHJRUW1STXo4ZEdvcDlGcE1laHoxV2FTTGVmZW85YTUwQzQ1VzdFemExUVVqdmVVMmFyMHo5MTljWWo0ZnQ5UjhpbUJkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;New Jersey health officials issued a warning about a potential measles exposure during &lt;a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/how-to-get-to-shakira-concerts-metlife-njtransit-strike/4185716/" target="_blank"&gt;the Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) announced that a non-New Jersey resident attended the concert while infected with the disease.

You should not visit a medical facility without calling ahead. Anyone who was exposed at the concert could develop symptoms as late as June 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those who are at risk of being infected by the measles are people who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past.

Measles can also cause pneumonia and swelling of the brain.

              &lt;p&gt;A common class of antidepressant medications might be even more useful than we thought. Research out today suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, can fend off cancer and boost the immune system’s defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Cell. In mice and other lab experiments, they found that SSRIs shrunk a variety of cancers, improved the immune system’s ability to kill cancer cells, and bolstered the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The researchers now hope to conduct clinical trials of SSRIs for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serotonin, a hormone with many important functions, has a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.1750"&gt;complicated relationship&lt;/a&gt; with cancer. While it appears to promote the growth of certain tumor types, it also seems to enhance our immune response to cancer. Accordingly, scientists have hoped that existing drugs that interact with serotonin, including many antidepressants, could be repurposed to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the UCLA researchers &lt;a href="https://stemcell.ucla.edu/news/drug-commonly-used-antidepressant-helps-fight-cancer-mice"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing MAO inhibitors—early generation antidepressants that regulate serotonin by inhibiting MAO—had an anticancer effect in mice. But these older drugs can cause serious side effects and interact badly with many other drugs or foods. So the researchers next decided to see if they could find a similar effect by targeting a different protein that interacts with serotonin, SERT. And as luck would have it, we already have existing and safer drugs that can inhibit SERT, the SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers used SSRIs on mouse and human models of several different cancers (some mice were given cancers derived from human cells, for instance): melanoma, breast, prostate, colon, and bladder cancer. On average, the treatment reduced the size of these tumors by more than 50%. Looking closer, the team also found that SSRIs appeared to make certain immune cells—killer T cells—better at recognizing and killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It turns out SSRIs don’t just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier—even while they’re fighting tumors,” said senior study researcher Lili Yang, a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084293"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Yang and her team then paired SSRIs with another treatment that boosts the immune system’s response against cancer, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy; these drugs work by inhibiting certain proteins that normally keep immune cells from attacking tumors. In tests with mice, the combination further shrunk melanoma and colon cancer tumors, and in some cases, it even seemed to completely eradicate the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the findings come from mice and other lab experiments, so we’re still a long way from SSRIs being the next big thing in cancer treatment. But the fact that these drugs are already approved to treat depression is an added boon, the authors say. Compared to experimental treatments, for instance, it would take much less money and resources to develop and potentially win approval of SSRIs for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;UCLA, on behalf of the lead researchers, has filed a patent covering their combination approach, and the team is next looking to put their hypothesis to the test in an actual human trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not,” said Yang, also a researcher at UCLA’s Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any luck, the same drugs that help ward off the blues can also become part of our arsenal against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Loneliness was closely tied to a cluster of defensive symptoms—pain, fatigue, and low mood—which were especially severe among the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that social connection helped reduce these symptoms, but the protective effects were strongest for those living in poverty.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for social, economic, and health policy, suggesting that strong social relationships may serve as important buffers against some of the health consequences of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defensive symptom cluster refers to set of frequently co-occurring and mutually reinforcing symptoms that, understood from an evolutionary perspective, represent the body’s response to danger and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved in groups which provided access to resources and protection from danger; when we feel socially excluded or isolated our bodies respond with a set of symptoms that are meant to protect us, for example pain helps protect us from injury, and fatigue and low mood may help us conserve energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, led by Dr Arran Davis of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, examined data from a survey of 24,505 respondents across 20 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in the lowest income decile were much likely to report feeling lonely in the last week than people in the highest income decile; 49% compared to just 15%. This is despite there being no difference in the amount of time people in different income deciles reported socialising with family, friends, and colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who report feeling lonely have, on average, higher scores on the symptom cluster. The average lonely person has a symptom cluster score that is higher than 67% of not lonely people. However, the difference in the average symptom cluster score between lonely people and not lonely people is significantly larger in the lowest income decile than the highest income decile. The average lonely person in the lowest income decile has a symptom cluster score higher than 73% of non-lonely people in the same income decile. In the highest income decile, the average lonely person has a higher symptom cluster score than 65% of non-lonely people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30% of lonely individuals from the lowest income decile had high symptom cluster scores compared with just 2% of non-lonely people in the highest income decile, suggesting that social relationships play a particularly important role in influencing the health outcomes of people living in poverty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has identified supportive social relationships as buffers to the negative effects of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study suggest that as material resources decrease the importance of social resources increase, with those who are both in poverty and lonely displaying the highest symptom cluster scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, evolutionary anthropologist, Dr Arran Davis said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The relationship between poverty and poor health is well established, and previous research suggests that loneliness may be as bad for you as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that for people who are both on low incomes and lonely the health costs are particularly marked. I hope this study inspires more research into the factors that lead people to feel socially disconnected and to the development of policies that support strong communities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this poverty and loneliness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a36332020333f743e2f342e323528343f1a3b3e373334743522743b39742f31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne – Oxford University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2025.02.037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/a&gt;” by Arran Davis et al. &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceived social isolation is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and depression.

&lt;p&gt;Up your protein. Add collagen. Walk 10,000 steps. Get more sleep. The list of tips for living longer is endless, and much of the advice comes from people with more social media followers than qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tom’s Guide, the fitness team works hard to cut through the noise. In our latest search for evidence-backed insights, we found a fascinating study that suggests strength training could be a key piece of the longevity puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/a&gt;, the study followed more than 14,000 adults aged 50 and over for 12 years, using grip strength as a simple measure of muscle health. It found that people with lower grip strength had a 45 percent higher risk of death during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: strong muscles aren’t just about how you look, they could help you live a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-grip-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is grip strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is exactly what it sounds like: how hard you can squeeze something with your hand. Think of it as your hand’s power meter. But it’s more than just winning at arm wrestling or opening stubborn jars. It’s actually a quick, simple way for doctors and researchers to get a snapshot of your overall muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because your grip says a lot about how strong your muscles are elsewhere in your body. As this study shows, keeping that strength up might just help you live longer and feel better as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-best-ways-to-build-better-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the best ways to build better strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, you don’t need to live at the gym or lift massive weights to build strength.

Researchers analyzed DNA methylation, a cellular marker of aging, in men aged 50 to 72 who followed a nutrient-rich, plant-forward lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who consumed more methyl adaptogen foods showed significantly greater reductions in epigenetic age, even after adjusting for weight changes and starting biological age. These results reinforce the idea that specific dietary choices can meaningfully impact how we age at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic Aging:&lt;/strong&gt; Measured through DNA methylation, epigenetic age reflects biological, not chronological, aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methyl Adaptogens:&lt;/strong&gt; Foods like garlic, green tea, turmeric, and berries were linked to slower cellular aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight and initial age differences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new research paper was published in &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;, titled “Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, researchers led by first author Jamie L. Villanueva from the University of Washington and the National University of Natural Medicine, along with corresponding author Ryan Bradley from the National University of Natural Medicine and University of California, investigated how diet influences epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110220"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows foods entwined into a DNA strand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that certain plant-based foods containing natural compounds called methyl adaptogens were associated with a decrease in epigenetic age. This effect was measured using DNA methylation, a marker that reflects how the body ages at the cellular level. The findings suggest that targeted food choices may help slow the aging process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Epigenetic age refers to how old a person’s cells appear biologically, rather than their actual age in years. DNA methylation patterns, which are chemical tags on DNA, can indicate whether someone is aging faster or slower than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers used Horvath’s epigenetic clock, a widely accepted tool, to measure changes in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included healthy men aged 50 to 72 who had previously completed an eight-week program featuring a plant-based, nutrient-rich diet, along with guidance on exercise, sleep, and stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on individual dietary differences to understand why some participants experienced greater improvements in epigenetic age than others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that those who ate higher amounts of methyl adaptogen foods—including turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries, green tea, and oolong tea—experienced greater reductions in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight changes and participants’ starting epigenetic age, suggesting that the foods themselves had a direct impact on aging markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural compounds in methyl adaptogen foods are known to influence how genes behave by affecting DNA methylation. Previous studies have shown that these compounds may support healthy aging and help lower the risk of conditions such as heart disease and cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this study involved a relatively small group of middle-aged men, it adds knowledge to growing global research showing that diets rich in polyphenols—found in vegetables, fruits, and teas—are associated with slower aging. These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Future research should include larger and more diverse populations and use updated epigenetic aging tools to confirm these results. Based on current evidence, this study highlights a practical, food-based strategy that may help reduce epigenetic aging and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#670a02030e06270e0a170604130d08121509060b144904080a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ryan Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://impactjournals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact Journals &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Braithwaite – Impact Journals&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.206240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/a&gt;” by Ryan Bradley et al. &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Aging is the primary risk factor for developing non-communicable chronic diseases, necessitating interventions targeting the aging process. Outcome measures of biological aging used in these interventions are mathematical algorithms applied to DNA methylation patterns, known as epigenetic clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Methylation Diet and Lifestyle study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a diet and lifestyle intervention that utilized epigenetic age as its primary outcome, measured using Horvath’s clock. Significant reductions in epigenetic age post-intervention were observed but with notable variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; This research aimed to identify dietary components associated with epigenetic age change across groups. Contributing factors to variability, such as weight changes and baseline differences in chronological and epigenetic age, were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the control group, these changes were not associated with epigenetic age changes in the regression model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that consuming foods categorized as methyl adaptogens may reduce markers of epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:20:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE93WDhhdDBMcVJreXhCbTdUTV9QVDNXWHhyWk5vS0VLNUU2X19YOGJjeXphejdsOV81Yko4WVZkYmxpdkt3UlNtODNGdVEtOW5jMmJWN3ZLRHBUY3FidW5pM2MxNXpMUGNNTGNpaG4xM2s</guid></item><item><title>新的阿尔茨海默氏症药物增强大脑保护，恢复记忆-神经科学新闻 | New Alzheimer’s Drug Boosts Brain Protection, Restores Memory - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9HaVRZUld0dFZGSFg4VUJHRkhaTGV3bzBySmRBUzRiekdtQTluUEtOMVFZaHk3WUV4UFFMOEtEZlpPTmF1a3NpNDlUdUN4M1dBaFpSMkh1aWV1dVlEc3M2YkhfTGJZRlk3U2ZNWTBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have identified a promising drug candidate, DDL-357, that improves memory in Alzheimer’s mouse models by increasing levels of a protective brain protein called clusterin (CLU). CLU helps prevent the buildup of toxic amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins, both key drivers of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, DDL-357 reduced levels of phospho-tau, improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced cognitive performance in maze tests. Though still in early stages, this candidate drug may work alongside existing treatments and could eventually be used for other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; DDL-357 boosts secreted clusterin (sCLU), which protects against toxic brain buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated Alzheimer’s model mice showed improved memory and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The drug may aid treatment for other diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As researchers work to improve treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, new research by UCLA Health identified a candidate drug that reduces levels of a toxic form of a protein in the brain caused by the disease and improved memory in mice by boosting production of a protective protein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; journal &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery,&lt;/em&gt; UCLA Health researchers targeted the protein clusterin (CLU), which is crucial in preventing the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins that that disrupt communication between brain cells and lead to memory impairment — a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110216"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, a variant of the gene that encodes clusterin was identified as the third strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It was recently reported that increased CLU protein could provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCLA Health researchers led by Varghese John identified a candidate small molecule, DDL-357, that increased concentrations of secreted clusterin (sCLU) in Alzheimer’s mouse models, resulting in a reduction of the toxic protein phospho-tau and improvement of mitochondrial function, both associated with progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DDL-357 also improved the memory of treated mice in maze-based cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open the door to the development of new treatments that not only target the underlying causes of Alzheimer’s disease but also restore lost cognitive function – something that existing therapies have yet to achieve,” said John, a professor of neurology and director of the Drug Discovery Laboratory (DDL) at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research and Care at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the drug candidate is still in pre-clinical testing and far from human trials, initial results suggest it could work in concert with existing Alzheimer’s disease treatments and may also be effective in treating other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”, John said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is one of the latest that John and fellow UCLA Health researchers at the Drug Discovery Laboratory have identified as potential candidates for development to treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study published in April found the molecule DDL-218 worked to increase levels in mouse brain of another protective protein, sirtuin 1, that is lower in people who carry apolipoprotein E4, a genetic variant of apolipoprotein, that confers the greatest risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential drug candidates provide an opportunity for the testing of new complimentary therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Neuropharmacology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2859a9d8781869d9cb29f97969c9786dc87919e93dc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Will Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Will Houston – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44386-025-00009-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Varghese John et al. &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite substantial research and drug discovery efforts, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mutation in the clusterin (CLU) gene that hinders expression of the cyto-protective secreted isoform of clusterin (sCLU) that affects the aggregation and clearance of two key proteins implicated in AD, Aβ and tau, is the third most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we present findings from our drug discovery program to identify small molecules that enhance sCLU levels and assess their impact on AD pathology and cognition in a murine model of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-throughput screening campaign identified two classes of epigenetic modulators that increase sCLU levels with subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts leading to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) with enhanced potency, drug-like properties, and oral brain bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead candidate NCE, DDL-357, increased brain sCLU in the murine ApoE4TR-5XFAD model of AD in a subchronic study. In a follow-up chronic study in the murine 3xTg-AD model, DDL-357 reduced phospho-tau in brain and led to improvements in mouse performance and memory in the Barnes maze testing paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic analysis of brain tissue from both AD models revealed changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal the potential of sCLU enhancement as a target for therapeutic development in AD and support the continued development of the preclinical lead candidate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:57:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9HaVRZUld0dFZGSFg4VUJHRkhaTGV3bzBySmRBUzRiekdtQTluUEtOMVFZaHk3WUV4UFFMOEtEZlpPTmF1a3NpNDlUdUN4M1dBaFpSMkh1aWV1dVlEc3M2YkhfTGJZRlk3U2ZNWTBn</guid></item><item><title>一些节育使用者数年没有经期—安全吗？ - CNN | Some birth control users go years without a period — is it safe? - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQeWRBNTZTWlhOS2I1QjFmaVJaQ3VpTzl6VDExSE9wSVc0cjBSZlhEb050OUFVRUE3RGZ0a0phTW1Sa3RnZDBUZWhlbC02QXlWUl9zVGQtOEdLMDdyS1Z3YWVtNFpxMENlY1lMeE9mZjRBbXB3Q3pGYk15NENlb291dGFlMDVNMEXSAYwBQVVfeXFMTXlBb0ZHOVJpOU5JRm5sVEVqWG5uSm9wWXJCc3gyQkh3UTJPNE5oSUk0X0pTVDdybU5FU05WdW9ST2V0UEtXclRuUGNfaE9mU2s4aGlwdHBOR1VxM25lNFp3bk9aUTNRWWcxOUdudjNocF8yb00zeTZNRkZvWHo1TXFhSVZMM3BPcTlLOXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Don’t like having your period? Hormonal birth control can be used for more than just preventing pregnancy — it’s also a popular way to go months or even years without a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/nutrition-early-menstruation-wellness"&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00023j6n529amkuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Continuous use birth control involves taking hormonal pills without what’s called a placebo week or using other methods such as an implant, ring or injections without a break. This method can end the regular bleeding associated with periods, as well as the cramps, migraines and other symptoms of menstruation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As social media becomes a hotbed for amateur medical advice and personal anecdotes, posts about getting off the pill and preventing pregnancy through nonhormonal methods rake in thousands of views daily on apps like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/getting-off-birth-control?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. As influencers share their fears about infertility and the possible harms of suppressing your body’s natural processes, reproductive experts say myths and misinformation about hormonal birth control are on the rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00043j6nq5mo8u5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To understand more about the risks, rewards and science behind using birth control to forego menstruation, I had a chat with reproductive health expert Dr. Kavita Nanda. As an obstetrician-gynecologist and clinical researcher for the North Carolina-based human development nonprofit FHI 360, Nanda has spent over 25 years studying continuous use birth control and other forms of contraception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does hormonal birth control work?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00073j6n6agm2m3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Kavita Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;Combined contraceptives use synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;together. Combination methods work to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovaries. Other methods use synthetic progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only, including pills, implants, injectables and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Both combined and progestin-only methods make the mucus in your cervix thicker, which makes it hard for sperm to enter the uterus, and the lining of your uterus also remains thin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00083j6najdzp7sj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is continuous use? And how does it differ from other methods?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00093j6nr0not83r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The standard way to take combined contraceptives is cyclically, every day for three weeks, and then you have a break in the hormones for a week. You either don’t take a pill, or you take a placebo for a week, so you have what’s called a withdrawal bleed. The lining of the uterus sheds, and that’s what people call a “period,” although it’s really just a hormone-free withdrawal bleed. But when we talk about continuous use, you don’t take any breaks. The uterine lining stays thin and intact, and this means that users can go weeks, months or even longer, without a “period.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000a3j6n4tagypqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How long can you safely go without a monthly bleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000b3j6nmv52co2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004695.pub3/full" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing continuous versus cyclical use, and it’s just as effective and just as safe. There’s no medical reason to have a period or withdrawal bleed when you’re on hormonal contraceptives. As long as you don’t have any contraindications (medical conditions) for the birth control pill, you don’t have contraindications for the continuous use of the pill.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000c3j6nfvhb7bt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, before contraception, women didn’t necessarily bleed all the time, because a lot of time was spent either being pregnant or breastfeeding. In both of those conditions, there’s no monthly bleeding, often for months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000d3j6nng331tw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, if you’re not pregnant or breastfeeding, you’re not on hormonal contraception, and you don’t have a monthly period — that’s something you do need to discuss with your provider, because that could signal an issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there any side effects specific to continuous use?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The side effects in general are similar to those with cyclical use. For example, you might have nausea, breast tenderness and headaches (at any time). With continuous use, some people experience unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting, especially initially, but this usually improves over time, and many people do achieve amenorrhea or (the) cessation of menses. For some people, it may take three to four months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000g3j6nwngmmro1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does continuous use affect fertility after stopping?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000h3j6nwfw3b3ws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no evidence that long-term use of hormonal contraception — whether it’s combined hormonal interception, taken continuously or cyclically — causes infertility, and fertility typically returns within a month or two. Basically, once you stop, the (synthetic) hormones go away very quickly from the blood, ovulation is no longer suppressed, your normal estrogen and progesterone production resume. Assuming that you had normal menstrual cycles before, they would resume. (One exception is) if you’re taking something like the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10335688/#:~:text=The%20proportion%20of%20fertility%20return%20among%20pregnant%20women%20who%20used,100%25%20and%2097.8%25%20respectively." target="_blank"&gt;Depo Provera contraceptive injection&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t cause infertility, but it may take longer for fertility to return after injections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000i3j6n6mz3kz4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why were placebo pills invented if there’s no harm in skipping them?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000j3j6nz48x5fza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;When the combined oral contraceptive pill was developed in the 1950s, the now-standard 21 days of active pills followed by a seven-day hormone-free interval was not based on medical necessity, but rather on cultural and strategic reasons. At the time, there was a widely held belief that menstruating every 28 days was a sign of normal female reproductive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000k3j6nkw075xiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To align with that expectation, the regimen was designed to mimic a natural menstrual cycle, with a monthly withdrawal bleed intended to reassure both users and physicians that they were not pregnant — important in an era before home pregnancy tests were readily available — and, at the time, to help ease religious and societal resistance to contraception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s really a personal preference and a discussion between a person and their provider. Someone might not want to have a period for years, or some people prefer to bleed three times a year. Some people feel reassured by monthly bleeding. Continuous use may be especially helpful for people who have painful periods, heavy periods, endometriosis, migraines, iron-deficiency anemia, physical or intellectual disabilities, and transgender individuals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This rare but severe disorder, marked by hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking after childbirth, can have life-threatening consequences if not treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight a strong familial risk, particularly when bipolar disorder is also present, underscoring the need for early screening and increased awareness. While the relative risk is high, the actual risk remains low, at 1.6%, but understanding family history could allow for preventive interventions and targeted mental health support during the vulnerable postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Familial Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a sister with postpartum psychosis raises a woman’s risk more than tenfold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The risk increases to 14x if the sister also has bipolar disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its severity, postpartum psychosis remains understudied and underdiagnosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Sinai researchers have found for the first time that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had experienced the condition, compared to a woman with a sister who did not. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were published May 19 in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; and highlighted at the American Psychiatric Association’s annual meeting press briefing the same day, suggest both genetic and shared environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is a rare but serious mental illness that leaves a devastating impact on mothers in the vulnerable weeks and months after childbirth. It carries increased risk of suicide and infanticide if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the early warning signs of postpartum psychosis are severe mood swings, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, insomnia, paranoia, and thoughts of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the devastating ramifications of the disorder, it remains vastly understudied and a challenge for physicians to diagnose and address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every woman of childbearing age and their physicians need to know about the existence of, severity, symptoms, and familial risk for postpartum psychosis so it can be promptly diagnosed and, hopefully, prevented,” said Veerle Bergink, MD, PhD, Director of the Women’s Mental Health Center at Mount Sinai and co-senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At present, too many women at higher risk don’t know it and are left on their own with a new baby and no support. We hope these study findings will help move the needle and impart change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, we can implement changes to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mount Sinai study team examined the records of more than 1.6 million women from the Swedish nationwide registries, identifying 2,514 women who had experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to finding that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had the condition, the Swedish registry study showed that the presence of bipolar disorder in a sister doubles the woman’s risk of developing postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with a sister who has bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis were shown to be at highest risk; their risk for developing postpartum psychosis themselves is 14 times increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured relative recurrent risk for the disorder, which implies increased likelihood of its appearance in another member of the family. This differs from actual risk, which refers to the probability of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers learned that while the relative risk of postpartum psychosis is quite high in full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sister is still low at 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings support the view that even though there is overlap between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder, these are in fact, distinct conditions,” said Dr. Bergink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new data will help move the needle and impart change. With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, measures can and should be taken to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond expanding awareness around postpartum psychosis, this study provides a solid foundation for the next step of research, aimed at early recognition and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work that involves identifying the genes responsible for this disease is already underway at Mount Sinai in the lab of Behrang Mahjani, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re using complex molecular data to investigate the genetic architecture of the disease,” says Dr. Mahjani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing what specific genes are involved will help us dive into the mechanisms and triggers of postpartum psychosis, and if they’re hormone- or immune-related. And that, in turn, could lead us to novel treatments and ways to proactively inform women of their risk before they’re faced with a severe health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this postpartum psychosis and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e0858c899a8182859488ce848f978c898e87a08d8f958e9493898e8189ce8f9287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Dowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountsinai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elizabeth Dowling – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Veerle Bergink. &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. Although genetic factors contribute to the risk of postpartum psychosis, the extent of familial risk remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared relative recurrence risk across different family relationship types, hypothesizing that relative recurrence risk for postpartum psychosis varies by degree of genetic relatedness and is higher in female full siblings than in cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cohort study consisted of 1,648,759 women from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,514 (0.15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within 3 months of their first-ever childbirth. The authors estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for female full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 10.69 (95% CI=6.60, 16.26) when adjusted for year of and age at childbirth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1.78, 95% CI=0.70, 3.62).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the higher familial risk of postpartum psychosis among full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sibling was relatively low, estimated at 1.60% within the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observed increased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings suggests both genetic and shared environmental influences. However, the lack of significant results in cousins hampers a more accurate distinction between these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite increased relative recurrence risk in siblings, their overall likelihood of developing postpartum psychosis remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores the need for further research to better understand the intricate interplay of genetics and shared environment in the development of postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:59:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PQklzNjN4X3pvelN3aWVqN0g3YzNaWDAwVXE5Yi1rZ3l1aklENy05Sk9TQkRvakNpd2dVNHJ1TG1NdC1TWWhScmVDTkZYVWU0RmIyWmM0V1U0OWd5VVpMTG9BSXRUenYyY1VZNDhmblVaUFU</guid></item><item><title>营养学家为您的健康评选最佳（和最差）包装熟食- HuffPost | Nutritionists Rank The Best (And Worst) Packaged Deli Meats For Your Health - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deli meat might be a lunchbox classic, but let’s be honest — not all cold cuts deserve a spot between your bread.

Honey Ham (2nd most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 10 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 570 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 2.5 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is still relatively lean, but as the name suggests, honey ham contains 2-3 grams of sugar per serving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep an eye on sodium — check a few different brands and choose the one with the lowest sodium option,” Villaseca advised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pastrami (8th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 604 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 3.3 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pastrami is flavorful and protein-rich, but comes with a bump in fat and sodium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Corned Beef (4th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 15 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 765 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 8 g (including 3 g saturated fat)&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cut from the leaner part of the brisket, corned beef is high in protein, but it’s also one of the saltiest options. It’s b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;est saved for the occasional Reuben.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Capicola (9th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 10 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 540 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 12 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capicola is more of a charcuterie star than a basic sandwich filler. It’s a traditional Italian cured meat (like prosciutto) that’s been dry-cured and aged rather than cooked. Its high fat content and marbling give it a chewy texture and rich flavor, making it the perfect pair for crackers, cheese and other cured meats, rather than as a standard deli slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. Sopressata (least popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 960 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 14 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you love it for snack plates, just balance it out with fiber-rich sides like whole grain crackers, fruit, or nuts,” Villaseca recommended. “It’s all about the big picture.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. Salami (6th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 995 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat:18 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a long shelf life and being portable, salami is handy for hikes or road trips. Pair with hydrating fruits like oranges or apples if you’re eating it on the go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;10.

They find new ways to maintain social relevance — often by doing things older generations don’t understand. (Don’t believe me? Just try to guess what any of their slang terms mean.) One of the latest teen trends is something that might raise a few eyebrows among parents, due to safety and privacy concerns: location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although teens crave independence from their parents, they are voluntarily sharing their real-time whereabouts with their friends. Popular phone tracking app Life360 recently found that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.life360.com/blog/gen-z-location-sharing-study" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gen Z is 70% more likely" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.life360.com/blog/gen-z-location-sharing-study" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Gen Z is 70% more likely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than any other age group to share their location with friends. And 94% of Gen Z surveyed said their lives benefit from location sharing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Snapchat announced that its location-sharing Snap Map has more than 400 million monthly active users, per&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" TechCrunch" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt; TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;.

Later, they “checked in” to places on Foursquare and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, shared real-time updates on Snapchat and Instagram stories, and tweeted every detail of their lives. Now, they use Snapchat’s Snap Map, Life360, or Apple’s location sharing to share with their friends everywhere they are in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This isn’t new,” Caswell said. “In a world where nearly everything is shared, this doesn’t feel invasive to teens — it feels normal. It’s just another way they stay looped into each other’s lives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teens also use apps like this to track their parents, according to Caswell, whose own daughter will text her if she sees her mom is at Ulta and ask for lip gloss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For many teens, location sharing is about connection and a sense of safety,” Caswell explained. “It’s their way of saying, ‘You’re in my circle’ and ‘I’ve got your back.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding The Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though sharing your location with friends might be popular, it doesn’t come without consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cheryl Groskopf, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheryl Groskopf, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;an anxiety, trauma, and attachment therapist based in Los Angeles, sees teens sharing their locations as a way “to manage anxiety, track social dynamics and feel less alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s comfort in knowing where your people are, especially in a world where teens constantly feel like they could get left out, replaced or excluded,” she said. “But that comfort is fragile — it relies on constant access (which leaves their nervous system hypervigilant to feeling ‘left out’).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” said Dr. Cameron Caswell, an adolescent psychologist.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you’re checking someone’s location because you don’t trust what they’re telling you — or because they don’t trust you — then it’s already crossed into a control dynamic,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her practice, she’s seen teens “spiral” when they spot their friend at a party they weren’t invited to, or “because someone didn’t respond fast enough, but ‘was clearly at home.’” She explained, “It becomes a setup for overthinking, panic and social surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Teens shouldn’t use location sharing when it’s being used to avoid rejection, manage someone else’s anxiety, or prove loyalty,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McInnis said, “Teens sharing their location and having their friends track them could harm their mental health.” Constantly seeing (and comparing) your friends’ social activities “can lead to feelings of inadequacy,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell agreed. “Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” she said. “Seeing a group of friends hanging out without them — even unintentionally — can make them feel lonelier and more left out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to these emotional risks, there are physical risks, too. Like a teen’s location data being available to someone who might wish them harm. “In the wrong hands, it can make [teens] more vulnerable to stalking, harassment or even predatory behavior, especially if they are in controlling relationships,” Caswell said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s A Gender Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teen girls may be more likely to use location sharing as a way to feel safer. According to the Life360 survey, 70% of Gen Z women believe their physical well-being benefits from location sharing. In the field, our experts also found that females were more likely to do this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell said that “mostly girls” will openly share their location with friends, “both for fun and because it makes them feel safer knowing someone always knows where they are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this sense of safety is a double-edged sword, as it can “increase the risk of stalking, harassment or even sexual violence,” Caswell said. “Especially when their location is shared with the wrong person, which is often someone they know and trust.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf warns of the dangers girls and femme teens may experience when their use of location-sharing is weaponized against them. “It can easily turn into emotional surveillance disguised as closeness,” she explained. (For example, a friend or partner telling them, “If you trust me, you’ll let me see where you are.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I see these kinds of patterns play out in high-control dynamics — friends or partners checking locations not to stay safe, but to manage anxiety, jealousy or power,” Groskopf said. “And girls are way more likely to internalize that and comply, even when it feels off. They’re more likely to be conditioned to avoid conflict, manage other people’s emotions, and keep the peace — even if that means overriding their own boundaries.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why teaching your kids how to set boundaries, in real life and online, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching your teen how to handle location-sharing in a safe way starts with conversations around consent and the ability to say no.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When asked if there is a safe way for teens to share their locations, Groskopf said, “Only if there’s real consent, boundaries, and the freedom to opt out without punishment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this case, the punishment could be feeling guilt-tripped or rejected by a friend. “That means not just technically having the option to stop sharing, but knowing you won’t be guilted, shut out, or shamed if you do,” Groskopf continued. “A parent saying, ‘I want to know where you are in case of emergency’ is one thing. A friend saying, ‘Why’d you turn off your location?’ with passive-aggressive silence afterward is something else entirely.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added, “Safe tracking only works when it’s not being weaponized to regulate someone else’s fear, jealousy or insecurity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Talk To Your Teen About Location Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start the conversation with curiosity, not criticism, Caswell said. “Instead of banning [location sharing], I recommend walking through privacy settings together and having calm conversations about why they’re sharing in the first place,” she said. “Is it for safety? To feel connected to their bestie? Because they feel pressured to? Helping teens understand why they are doing it makes location sharing a lot safer and more intentional.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From there, encourage your teen to only share their location with “a small, trusted circle of close friends or family,” and check in on this list frequently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One mom I worked with told me her daughter was shocked to find an ex-boyfriend still had access to her location,” Caswell said. “Of course, that explained why he kept ‘randomly’ showing up wherever she was. Instead of freaking out, the mom used it as an opportunity to talk with her daughter about how to use tech more safely moving forward.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s always a good idea to talk with your teens about how to stay safe online and set boundaries around privacy with their friends. But keep in mind, this starts at home. “Let your teen say no to you sometimes,” Caswell suggested. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Aged 53 at the time, Topol considered healthy aging to be of deep scientific — and personal — interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5Q265BEZZZAWZB42LOJMK7CEMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He also suspected the answer was genetic. So, with colleagues, he spent more than six years sequencing the genomes of about 1,400 people in their 80s or older with no major chronic diseases. All qualified, Topol felt, as “Super Agers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XIOV4OSS5FCRTHALOV3K34V3GE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But they shared few, if any, genetic similarities, he and his colleagues found, meaning DNA didn’t explain their super aging. So, what did, Topol and his colleagues wondered?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LFF4KYKHKZEBJA44GLJC7IIQOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His new book, “Super Agers: An Evidence-based Approach to Longevity,” is his answer. Synthesizing hundreds of studies about health, disease and aging, his book talks about a future where advanced drugs, biochemistry and artificial intelligence should allow us to turn back the clock and slow how rapidly we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="URRLUOKUIBDG7GL3PE7MRHSJSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Already, he says, we can dramatically increase our chances of becoming super agers with a few lifestyle tweaks, such as eating better (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/02/ultra-processed-foods-identification/" target="_blank"&gt;avoid processed foods&lt;/a&gt;) and sleeping enough (seven hours is good).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GYWEURRXZ5EHJFNGRFX2L475A4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there’s one lifestyle change, he says, that influences aging far more than any other. It also has altered his own life the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YYTMO3TNXNB67JWEUQUKH6QQSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To learn more, I talked with Topol, 70, about what he’s doing to become a super ager and how the rest of us can do the same. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U3YCBWDTZNCLPH5RATVNJVD644" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, what is the single most important lifestyle change people can make to age better?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FLUWWTA5PNHOBMJ6ECT7RZZNYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of all the things we know about, the one that rises to the very top is exercise. In fact, it’s the only intervention in people that has shown any effect on slowing the body-wide aging clock, meaning it appears to change how rapidly we age. Of course, other lifestyle factors, like diet and social interactions, are critically important. But if there is one thing that has the most exceptional evidence for healthy aging, it’s exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WXXUHMAG4BHJBEXVDTOR6MJUDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For decades, as a cardiologist, I would always be emphasizing aerobic exercise to my patients, whether that was walking or bicycling or swimming or elliptical or you name it. I’d say to get at least 30 minutes most days. And that’s what I did myself. I didn’t really accept the importance of strength training until I began researching the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JTKNCXIFUNGCTN3GHYCK5INHOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I saw all the evidence, I became totally convinced. Resistance training and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/18/grip-strength-muscles-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; have extraordinary correlations with healthy aging. And so, well over a year ago, I went from being pretty much a weakling — I never worked on any muscles, except my legs, from doing lots of bicycling and hiking and walking — to now I’m stronger than I’ve ever been in my life, and it’s just been terrific. I’ve got better balance and posture, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YNGPY56FTJB2RD7DJZ2PHJ5OAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s your strength training routine like? Do you work with a trainer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGQX4HLDNVDXXNMDKTUFBNNSBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Well, I didn’t want to hurt myself and I was definitely a beginner, so I did start off with a trainer a couple of times a week. But now it’s only about once a month. And I tell people, you don’t have to have a trainer. You can find good information about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;getting started online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZZIIO7XNUNAGFNLSLSNNTHTACY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you work out at a gym or at home?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4S5VJXFWMVERLGXMC2CVIUMRPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I do it all at home. It saves time and expense. I tell my patients, the more convenient and practical your training is, the more likely it is to get done, and that sure works for me. I usually do &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;planks, lunges, squats,&lt;/a&gt; sit-ups on a medicine ball, the &lt;a href="https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/16/cobra/?srsltid=AfmBOor7DCjIuV5QS3oUEUpBWisLK6Qqrd72YVg7GOPcZbmgz3hdA6fI" target="_blank"&gt;cobra&lt;/a&gt;, and a bunch of other floor exercises. I also use resistance bands. And I’ve learned about the importance of things like balance,&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24978931/" target="_blank"&gt; standing &lt;/a&gt;on a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiuYyJOikPE" target="_blank"&gt;foam&lt;/a&gt; pad, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMH7LEZSVFH53GWS4HGM2654HY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yes, I do. I also try to touch my shin while standing on one foot. All of this, the strength training, the balance, the rest, it’s made me feel so &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/fitness-test-by-age-exercise/" target="_blank"&gt;strong and fit&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like I should have done this decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OINYFCZLHJFJ7HFSVFUKAWWPQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it ever too late to start doing this kind of training?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZJ35C7XXOVCBJB6P2JXDUZ5WSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Absolutely not. It’s never too late. This idea that you can’t build muscle or strength as you age is silly. No matter what your age, and I’m not young anymore, you’re fully capable of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;getting stronger and athletically fit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A5P643CSXBFTDOV4DF6CMIAMZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;You still do aerobic exercise?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WE4ECBJLZJEJNP5MRRUCYV4LJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course. I used to do aerobics six out of seven days a week, for 30, sometimes 40 minutes. Now I do aerobics about four times a week and integrate the resistance training the other days. And sometimes I do both. But it’s still less than an hour. I don’t have enough time to do more and that’s an important point. When I talk to my patients about exercise, we get into the details of their lives. They’re working. They’re tired. So we talk about when they can fit in time for exercise. Do they have a lunch break? Maybe they can go for a brisk walk. Or do lunges at home later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJ3C3LREFBDJBBTRXJZ3LJBA2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the book, you talk about how being outside and being with other people are both important for healthy aging. What about exercising outside with some friends?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CVI6MZSN45EUBOIIXSTVV5HUPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Oh, yeah, that’s great. The data suggests that, as we get older, we tend to become recluses. And that’s not good for healthy aging. And being in nature — I never would have thought that would be important for health. But the data are strong. If you can be outside moving around in nature with friends, that’s a twofer, a threefer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YPQ24C7XBBUBFIJ6NIPQ3UNLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the endgame here?

The goal is extending our healthspan, our years of life that are without the major age-related diseases, especially cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. What we can see from studies is that you can get seven to 10 years of extra healthy aging from lifestyle factors, especially exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66YBDO2GJRAGFNP5QKJKFJEI5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What age do you want to live to?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WE37TD4KLRCENIPSWPBRXKEXNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Well, I don’t have any of the age-related diseases yet. So, as long as that goes on, I’d be happy to get well into my 80s and beyond. I’d say that if you’re 85 and you don’t have any of those diseases, you’ve hit the jackpot.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6gj000x3b7724jx3mip@published"&gt;My boyfriend has been having a series of rolling health issues that require emergency room trips, which is awful. But the worst thing is how he acts when he’s there: He doesn’t ask questions, push for care, or remind the medical staff that he’s alive. He had a cardiac event instead of warning the nurse about his symptoms because he worried he was “bothering” the guy who had other patients. In every ER I’ve been to, if you aren’t firm to the point of pushy, you won’t get medical care. I work two hours away, so I can’t always be there immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="229" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6iv000y3b77qosxztg2@published"&gt;I love and care for him, but I’m not his mom. Going to the doctor or the ER when things go wrong, but then not actually asking any questions or telling the doctor about his symptoms is becoming a huge problem. He’ll go home, and the problem will continue untreated, and I’ll end up driving him back to the ER when I get home, or we’ll have to make a second expensive specialist appointment because he didn’t ask for answers the first time. I can’t always be there, and honestly, navigating doctors for an adult who won’t do it for himself is the least sexy thing I can imagine. I know I need to be sympathetic because he’s sick and scared, but I’m mad. I know self-advocacy wouldn’t make him not sick, but it would help! I’m out of PTO and worried about what will happen next time he has an emergency if I can’t leave work. As a teenager, I was hospitalized alone in a foreign country where I didn’t speak the language, and broken bones/work accidents/severe asthma have sent me to ERs in the States plenty of times since. I’ve always come out metaphorically fighting. I know it sucks, but if you don’t tell people what you need in an understaffed system, you won’t get it. What can I do? Telling him to be firm isn’t helping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6op00113b77m2eqq3cy@published"&gt;I don’t want to come off as too harsh here, so I’ll start off with an admission: I once cried because I thought my husband (then fiancé) didn’t drink enough water. He was fine. I just worried that he might one day become dehydrated. So, I totally get loving someone and wanting them to take better care of themselves. But that little breakdown over hydration concerns is now a joke in my marriage because, well, it was ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6qp00123b771ntisqrv@published"&gt;You have to remind yourself, like I did, when I realized that: This is an adult we’re talking about. You mentioned that you’re not his mom. And it doesn’t sound like he’s even complained to you or asked for help. Also, it’s not as if he has a dangerous disease and is refusing treatment. He’s going to the hospital, he’s just not being quite as assertive as you would be. That’s allowed. And it’s not an automatic death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6sp00133b77opw7jtsf@published"&gt;I think you’re right that self-advocacy and assertiveness help to get results in medical settings, but the healthy thing to do would be to share that insight with him and then just stop. Don’t push. Don’t stress. Let him make his own choices, reminding yourself that all different kinds of people with all different kinds of personalities find their way in life without your guidance. And if it feels hard to imagine washing your hands of the situation, given your love and care for him, think of it this way: At this point, you’re bossing him around and being angry and frustrated, but you’re not actually succeeding in getting him better care. So what is there to lose if you allow him to manage things on his own? If it’s partially the finances you’re worried about, he can schedule and pay for the pricey specialist follow-up visit himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw70c00143b77t7w1mad9@published"&gt;One last thought: I often find that when I’m really wound up about someone else not doing something the “right” way, I’m focusing on their shortcomings instead of something in my own life that needs improvement just as urgently. Consider turning your attention to yourself, and being as clear and honest about what you see as you wish your boyfriend would be with the ER doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoey001n3b77wxfdiuu4@published"&gt;Openly LGBTQ+ people are not common in my culture. I have a friend who’s from the same background as me. The thing is, I’m pretty sure he likes guys. I don’t know if there’s anyone in his life he’s opened up to about this, but I want to somehow let him know I’d be a safe person to talk to. I don’t feel like I can just ask him, as it isn’t really anyone’s business if he’s not ready to share. But it hurts to imagine that he may be suffering in silence.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoez001o3b775lisdafb@published"&gt;Sometimes when he says something disparaging about LGBTQ+ people, I’ll gently push back with something along the lines of “being LGBTQ+ is not the end of the world.” But I’m afraid if I were to push back any harder than that, or if I hint too much about what I suspect, I could scare him away. Sadly, I feel like there’s absolutely nothing I can do until he decides he’s ready. Am I right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoez001r3b77bjspxusb@published"&gt;I think you could take a harder stance than saying it’s “not the end of the world.” What about something like, “Are you serious? It’s 2025!”; “Maybe it makes me a bad [member of whatever community you’re a part of] but I’m all for people dating/loving/being attracted to/sleeping with whoever they want”; or, “I know that’s what we learned growing up but I just can’t get on board with it.” And if you’re “out” as an ally, you could use what you post and share on social media to signal that you’re not homophobic, and are not OK with LGBTQ+ people being discriminated against or otherwise mistreated.&lt;/p&gt;

Be gentle with your friend if he comes to you with less controversial admissions—like if he misses the deadline to file his taxes, doesn’t get into dental school, or tells you he has social anxiety. Make sure you encourage him to be kind to himself, normalize what he’s going through, and remind him how highly you think of him. Hopefully, if the day comes that he’s wondering, “Who could I talk to about liking guys?” you’ll pop up in his mind as someone who’s always been an open-minded, non-judgmental friend.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of my position, our teacher has asked for my input on senior leadership for next year, and so I know which students will be in what positions. This is Very Important Information to everyone in this elective, and since our teacher mentioned that I know, many people have been asking me about it. I can’t tell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgyoa7002b3b775iy7yn6w@published"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly reminded people that they’ll find out in a week, and that I really can’t tell them. But they keep bugging me about it, and I would like to be able to eat lunch without constant questions. How do I ward people off and get them to have some patience? (I suppose patience is not really a trait teenagers are known for, but still.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgyoa8002e3b77tb1d5vhu@published"&gt;Ask the teacher who mentioned that you have this intel to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; mention that they’ve made you promise not to share. Maybe said teacher can even hint that there will be consequences for everyone in the elective if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; share too soon. Then show up at lunch armed with more interesting conversation &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;topics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At a school event I bumped into an attractive woman whom I didn’t recognize. She came by and asked if I remember her. It turns out that she was someone I bullied in high school. After that day I noticed other moms slowly avoiding me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/12/dear-prudie-woman-bullied-high-school-revenge-sons.html"&gt;I think she must have told them about how I used to bully her…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He reported that the pain had erupted immediately after he'd stifled a sneeze by pinching his nose and closing his mouth at the same time. He was driving and contending with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/46015-hay-fever.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/46015-hay-fever.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hay fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; symptoms when he stifled the sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the man didn't have any trouble breathing, swallowing or talking, his doctors noticed a faint crackling sound during an initial examination of his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the doctors took an X-ray to investigate further, they found signs of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subcutaneous-emphysema?lang=gb" target="_blank" data-url="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subcutaneous-emphysema?lang=gb" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surgical emphysema&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which air gets trapped under the deepest tissue layers below the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;A CT scan then showed that a tear had formed between the third and fourth bones in the patient's neck, which enabled air to escape from his windpipe, or trachea, and into tissues of the neck and the space between the lungs. The hole in his trachea measured 0.08 by 0.08 inches (2 by 2 millimeters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors concluded that the tear likely formed due to a "rapid build-up of pressure in the trachea while sneezing with a pinched nose and closed mouth," according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/16/12/e255633" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/16/12/e255633" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient's medical providers determined that he didn't need surgery to repair the tear. Instead, they monitored him in the hospital for two days, carefully watching his oxygen levels and other vital signs and not providing food by mouth for the first day. He was then discharged with prescriptions for pain-relief and hay fever medications, as well as doctor's orders to avoid strenuous activity for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oGJnXHinYzeqiecYmVJnhm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oGJnXHinYzeqiecYmVJnhm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a checkup five weeks later, a CT scan of the man's neck showed that the tear had completely healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Spontaneous windpipe tears aren't widely reported in the medical literature, with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(06)00659-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(06)00659-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(13)00623-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(13)00623-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220731" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220731" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documented prior to this case.

I'd just been for a mid-winter run in a frozen park in the Finnish city of Oulu. The air temperature was -15C (5F). At 170km (106m) south of the Arctic Circle, this is the world's northernmost &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80r3myl990o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Parkrun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Less than an hour later, I ducked into a sauna – a dimly-lit wooden room where intense heat was radiating from a massive wood-burning stove. The thermometer read 85C (185F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As I sat there, sweating like crazy, a fellow sauna-goer threw a ladleful of water onto the stove's hot stones to make "löyly" – Finnish for a sudden burst of steam that surges through the air. It's a powerful sensation, almost shocking. The heat reached deep into my skin and muscles, melting away any tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But that wasn't enough for me. Stepping outside into the cold air, steam rose from my body, and I clambered down an ice-encrusted ladder into the excruciatingly cold water of the Oulu River, which had a temperature of around 1C (34F). I felt piercing pain, like a million needles striking my skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But I didn't jump out. Instead, I counted slowly up to 12. And after a few seconds the pain seemd to disappear – I actually felt okay with it. It was almost like an icy hug. When I clambered out, the air around me seemed almost warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To some, it might sound like the morning schedule of a deranged masochist. But this sequence of cold, hot and then cold again made me feel strangely alive. A sauna followed by an ice bath is known as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40094855/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;contrast therapy&lt;/a&gt; in sports medicine – and it feels surprisingly good.

The effect was enhanced the more frequent the sauna use was, with a 66% reduction in dementia and 65% in Alzheimer's disease among those who used a sauna between four and seven times per week, compared with those who only used the sauna once per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study did not, however, compare the effects of a sauna against the risk in men who did not use saunas at all and so the results may also reflect something more generally about the lifestyles of people who have time to indulge in sauna bathing in the first place.  It is also worth remembering such observational results do not necessarily mean a direct cause and effect relationship between saunas and dementia.

"Sauna is a space where our norms and conventions are temporarily suspended – we take off our clothes, sit in close proximity, and endure extremes together," she says. "These are great, ritual environments for our identities to transform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sauna therapist Laura Foon says the warm, calm atmosphere induces a sense of relaxation. "Today, we're constantly on high alert," she says. "Diving into soothing darkness in the sauna is profoundly healing." It is like returning to the womb, she suggests. The sauna is a reassuringly safe space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But what about when you skip out of the sauna and plunge yourself into a lake shrouded in ice?

&lt;p class="block"&gt;Last Thursday, May 15, Sachem High School East Principal Lou Antonetti sent a letter home to the 123 people who the district believed had extended contact with the infected individual who had an active case of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"We are contacting you because we have reason to believe that you had contact with this individual during the time (s)he was infectious," Antonetti wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;On Monday, May 19, the district provided a free skin test to those potentially exposed. The district also offered the option for students and staff to go to their doctors for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Suffolk County Health Department spokesperson said the agency could not disclose how many of the 123 people were tested at the school versus privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“It was only one student anyway that had it, and everybody is being tested, so I’m not worried about it," Holtsville resident Lisa Russo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Others said they were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"What's being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?" Farmingville resident Janie Gallo asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The tests take two days to show results. According to district officials, the test results will be evaluated at the high school today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Testing will be done again in July after a 2-month incubation period has elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Tuberculosis is a potentially serious infectious disease caused by bacteria. It primarily affects the lungs and causes a persistent cough and chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The bacteria are easily spread through the air when actively sick people cough, sneeze or speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“I’ve had TB before, so you can fight it," Farmingville resident Anton Kovary said. "You can overcome any kind of disease you have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the state health department, there were 1,089 total statewide tuberculosis cases last year, including 48 in Nassau County and 52 in Suffolk County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:12:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQTlVUemFVajRKTWlFT0hmYlhJTC04d2N3ZTVEQVpEbWlSN001Y2JVUTMxSGgyUzNkdHR1eVZyb2Y2V2NEN0pxSkZVS09jcFM2Y1VrY1BoYW1LVmc1cWhtWHFRQl9ZaEpLcmNBRDBVOUdGOURCUmM1QktKbnNHeVRFdlJpdC1nTU9XWG1tdTVIR2ZxLUlTTTJDN183N2llTWpFM2NR</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的父母通过加大疫苗接种力度来对抗麻疹疫情- NBC新闻 | A surge of Texas parents fought measles outbreak by stepping up vaccine effort - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZVpzR25JZWdJN2lITS1nWEgxTWZGRi1VZTlfRURiVDlZNGo1ZnBtdm0tazNkRDdJemtCXzM2UFZNRDNobTF1cDZueW1rdDFOYmlWcV9SaThTendXRGRiT29ta3F3azlUS2hxNHhTUFZsU0lRbEhaYXRHWkVwYTU0cnJSSWViLVlTS3JtRW4xNklrMUZtdk52VlJDR0UtU2E1TUxIVkFvZk1Td9IBVkFVX3lxTFBPc1VkRHQwX01fUzZoLTM2QWVZeGprc1pHVHN0NW9aUUk1Z2ZDTm5LNDF4T0pEMXVMcjY1UDd2SE1sako3VWR4UENvdUQwTnlPSk85dVB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kala Hunter did not hesitate to get her 2-year-old son, Brady, fully vaccinated in March as the number of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases grew&lt;/a&gt; in her West Texas community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Being in the hotbed of the measles outbreak,” said Hunter, 47, of Lubbock, “it was a no-brainer.

One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A second dose increases protection to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During measles outbreaks, however, the first dose can be given as early as 6 months old. If a child has already received the first dose at 12 months, doctors can give the second dose about a month later, said Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and health authority for the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Public health measures, which include vaccinations, stop the spread of the virus, even in areas with outbreaks of measles,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the time, fewer than 2% of infants get vaccinated early for measles, according to the Truveta data. The company used its access to electronic health record information for tens of thousands of infants in Texas to assess early vaccination uptake in the state. That low percentage isn’t surprising as the shots aren’t generally given early unless there’s an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The data shows that early vaccinations of Texan infants 6 to 11 months old ticked up in February as word of the outbreak spread. The number increased even more in March, and by April, it was exponentially higher than vaccination percentages before the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZVpzR25JZWdJN2lITS1nWEgxTWZGRi1VZTlfRURiVDlZNGo1ZnBtdm0tazNkRDdJemtCXzM2UFZNRDNobTF1cDZueW1rdDFOYmlWcV9SaThTendXRGRiT29ta3F3azlUS2hxNHhTUFZsU0lRbEhaYXRHWkVwYTU0cnJSSWViLVlTS3JtRW4xNklrMUZtdk52VlJDR0UtU2E1TUxIVkFvZk1Td9IBVkFVX3lxTFBPc1VkRHQwX01fUzZoLTM2QWVZeGprc1pHVHN0NW9aUUk1Z2ZDTm5LNDF4T0pEMXVMcjY1UDd2SE1sako3VWR4UENvdUQwTnlPSk85dVB3</guid></item><item><title>我尝试了「日式步行」方法一周—我迷上了-汤姆的指南 | I tried the ‘Japanese walking’ method for a week — and I’m hooked - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxObVc3NmJyRTU4YldnY3UwVU9oRmt0Rk1udW1oSk9oNGYwamdGZ0JiT2tMVVZ2QUROd3F2NHZRM1NjRkNqcjNQbVdvOGhpY21nLWtiSW1PWTBFN3ZSVWllSXl5ejNSbkpfWF83ZjRZRGpWZlVvSUhhTUtidzBwa1NTM0RiUXFsczVQcHFWVm1fcGhFM2dLOHBQbmh3dkhhR19TdWVTRHlR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here on the Tom’s Guide fitness desk, we love nothing more than a walking trend — from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina"&gt;silent walking&lt;/a&gt; to the viral &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/12-3-30-treadmill-workout" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/12-3-30-treadmill-workout"&gt;12-3-30 workout&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve tried them all. The latest trend in walking? The Japanese Interval Walking Training (IWT), which promises to burn more fat and lower your blood pressure. To find out more, I grabbed a comfy pair of sneakers, one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers,&lt;/a&gt; and gave it a go. Read on to find out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-japanese-interval-walking-method-3"&gt;What is the Japanese interval walking method?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interval walking method originated in Japan, and is a form of HIIT training. As its name suggests, you alternate your pace throughout. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set a timer on your watch or phone and walk for three minutes at a low intensity. This should be a 4/10 effort — you’re still moving, but you should easily be able to hold a conversation with someone next to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then walk three minutes at a high intensity. This is a 7/10 walking effort — you should be working hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep switching between paces for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-3"&gt;What are the benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until now, we’ve been told that 10,000 steps a day is the holy grail to aim for when it comes to walking, but is the IWT method better for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s no right or wrong when it comes to adding more steps to your day, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have found IWT has several health benefits. After three months of doing a 30-minute interval walk three times a week, participants had a lower blood pressure and cholesterol, increased leg strength, and more aerobic capacity than those who walked continuously at a moderate pace for the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re also likely to burn more calories walking intervals, as by nature, you’ll increase your heart rate during the faster-paced minutes. If walking for weight loss is your goal, remember you’ll need to be in a calorie deficit, burning more calories than you consume. One easy way to track this is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-gave-japanese-interval-walking-training-a-go-here-s-what-happened-3"&gt;I gave Japanese Interval Walking Training a go — here’s what happened &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more, I gave this method a go on my daily walks for a week. Here’s how I got on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZBXTUcLUCBbRCP6FESBk6X" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZBXTUcLUCBbRCP6FESBk6X slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-was-instantly-hooked"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was instantly hooked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method immediately took me back to speed sessions on the track, and I loved it. I loved pushing myself during the faster-paced intervals, then slowing down and catching my breath before going again. Unlike other walking workouts, you jump straight into this one, meaning you’re getting your heart rate pumping almost straight away — perfect if you’re short on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walk every morning, and have done so for years, and this was a great way to mix things up. I noticed my heart rate was higher than it would be on my normal morning walk, although I admit I tend to stroll along with a coffee, not power down the street with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the faster intervals, I had to think about my form — keeping my core engaged, my torso up, and my arms swinging in time with my legs.

Sometimes in the sling, other times in his stroller. The extra resistance of carrying or pushing my baby made this a real workout and left me sweating. New levels of mom strength unlocked, and all before 9 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My verdict &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a way to mix up your daily walk, increase your fat burn, and reap several health benefits, give Interval Walking Training a go. I loved it, and while I won’t be committing to it seven mornings a week (I’ll admit, I missed my chilled, meditative walks too much), I’ll be sure to keep this up a couple of times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a runner, I use my walks as a form of active recovery, but this was a great way to work on my cardiovascular endurance, without the impact of running. Plus, it was done in 30 minutes. If fitting long workouts into your routine feels overwhelming, this can be done with no equipment, on your lunch break, in your local park. No excuses — what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Apple Watch Series 10" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Today's best Apple Watch Series 10 deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

She lives alone and insists she’s “just fine,” but I can see she’s slipping -- physically, mentally and emotionally. She has high blood pressure, diabetes and serious arthritis, but she won’t stay on her medications. She hasn’t been to a primary care doctor in over five years. She flat-out refuses cancer screenings or even basic lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OQE2TOQXWNFG7HLMMPXJBQLLJI"&gt; Lately, I’ve noticed what could be signs of early dementia -- getting lost on familiar roads, forgetting appointments, struggling to follow conversations. I finally got her to see a neurologist last fall, and they recommended a brain scan and further testing. She never followed through. Now she’s barely leaving the house and won’t let me bring in any outside help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EQZOMK2WZJBCPI62TJWYSI23ZY"&gt; I’ve tried small changes to keep her safe -- grab bars in the bathroom, meal deliveries, even offering to go with her to doctor appointments. Every single time, she shuts me down with, “Don’t start” or, “I’m not an invalid.” She’s isolating more and her mobility is getting worse. I’m scared she’s going to fall or end up in the ER with something that could’ve been managed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AE5LLV5IZFBT7OVIHNZ3OFOO54"&gt; How do I respect her independence while also not sitting back and watching her decline? -- Worried and Worn Out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZTAMB7ZJVZGNXBGBMQWMROQF3M"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Dear Worried:&lt;/b&gt; You are carrying a heavy burden, and I commend your patience and devotion. But here’s the hard truth: You can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. No matter how much you care or how hard you try, you cannot force your mother to seek help if she refuses it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZKTO75QF2RHHFDP5WSGIOJFL6U"&gt; What you can do is focus on safety. Make the home as secure and fall-proof as possible. Consider a home health consultation or speak with her primary care physician about ways to support her from a distance.

			&lt;p&gt;Sitting might be a comfortable and convenient way to spend much of your day, but a new study of older adults suggests it can lead to brain shrinkage and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive issues&lt;/a&gt;, irrespective of how much exercise you're managing to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research counters the idea that periods of sitting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-optimal-number-of-daily-steps-to-offset-sitting-down"&gt;can be balanced out&lt;/a&gt; by periods of being active, at least when it comes to brain health in people aged 50 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study researchers, from Vanderbilt University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Seoul National University, think that too much sitting or lying down (known as sedentary behavior) can impact the brain and increase the risk of different types of dementia later in life, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Reducing your risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="161777" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is not just about working out once a day," &lt;a href="https://news.vumc.org/2025/05/13/study-reveals-sedentary-behavior-is-an-independent-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Marissa Gogniat, from the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 404 volunteers, tracking their activity levels with wearables over the course of a week. Then, over the next seven years, cognitive tests and brain scans were used to assess their brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though 87 percent of the volunteers were meeting the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2018.14854"&gt;recommended weekly guidelines&lt;/a&gt; of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, those who sat more overall showed worse cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also showed more signs of neurodegeneration – including a faster thinning of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain crucial to memory function and one of the first areas to show damage from Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161780" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SittingChart.jpg" alt="Sitting statistical analysis" class="wp-image-161780 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SittingChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SittingChart-600x300.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161780" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team charted time spent sitting against signs associated with dementia. (Gogniat et al, &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association wasn't huge, and doesn't prove direct cause and effect, but it was noticeable: spending &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/excessive-sitting-raises-risk-of-early-death-now-we-know-how-much"&gt;more time sitting&lt;/a&gt; seems to age the brain faster, and reducing that amount of time, rather than just exercising more, appears to be the best antidote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger associations were found in those already at a higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://news.vumc.org/2025/05/13/study-reveals-sedentary-behavior-is-an-independent-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Angela Jefferson, from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these findings aren't a reason to give up more vigorous exercise. We know that being active does wonders for our physical and mental health, and even small amounts of exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;keep the brain sharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's most important here is that extra hours sitting down were linked to certain kinds of wear and tear in the brain. This &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-0799-5"&gt;isn't the first time&lt;/a&gt; that sedentary behavior has been linked with dementia and Alzheimer's, but it's another important and comprehensive set of data that researchers and health professionals can draw on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age," &lt;a href="https://news.vumc.org/2025/05/13/study-reveals-sedentary-behavior-is-an-independent-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jefferson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70157"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. testified that vaccines are exempt from pre-licensure safety studies. Is it actually the case that vaccines are approved without safety studies?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S6SOOTGJQZCJVENEEN3VPEQQPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No, this is not true. Vaccines undergo rigorous safety testing and are continuously monitored for adverse events. They go through &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101" target="_blank"&gt;several stages&lt;/a&gt; of clinical trials before approval (known as licensure), with thousands of people studied to prove safety and effectiveness before vaccines are cleared for the general public. In addition to extensive preapproval safety testing, vaccines are continuously monitored for any problems — often for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S7CJMDYMLVDDZL2AUKGR3K6YSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are several ways that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ACIP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices within the CDC, do this continuous monitoring. One is via the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which researchers use to analyze health data from millions of people to find any adverse impacts of immunizations. Another is CISA, the Clinical Immunization Safety Project, a national network of CDC vaccine safety experts and research centers that investigates any potential health issues following immunization and works directly with patients to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PNWY5MKR3JFB7M45O3QGUJEABY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s also VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which allows individuals to submit potential issues following vaccination. This self-reported data, in conjunction with other ongoing testing, can help experts identify whether reported side effects are in fact tied to the vaccines themselves. Pharmaceutical companies do their own product safety studies as well. Vaccine experts told us that vaccines are &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; safety-tested than other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IGC4GCAGUFDXXKBDVEJV5KB4QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/" target="_blank"&gt;long disparaged vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and often speaks about the need to placebo-test them — referring to a process in which one group gets vaccinated while the other does not.

India has recorded 257 COVID-19 cases as of Monday, May 19, as per the Union Health Ministry.The health authorities are vigilant, especially with the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/jn-1-variant" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;JN.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a sublineage of Omicron, spreading globally. Vaccination played a crucial role in preventing the virus during the pandemic. Now, researchers have discovered a promising alternative to traditional COVID-19 shots, one that may be safer, more effective, and better at stopping the virus where it first enters the body: the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How are &lt;keyword id="26933613" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="nasal-vaccines" source="keywords"&gt;nasal vaccines&lt;/keyword&gt; different from traditional ones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by the researchers from Yale University found that nasal vaccine boosters could offer safer and more targeted protection against respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, without the need for traditional immune-boosting additives. The findings are published in the journal Nature Immunology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most vaccines and boosters are administered as injections directly into the muscle tissue, usually in the upper arm. But for respiratory diseases like COVID-19, protection right where the virus enters, the respiratory tract, could be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs that all is not well with your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that nasal vaccine boosters can trigger strong immune defenses in the respiratory tract, even without the help of immune-boosting ingredients known as adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows how a simple viral protein antigen can boost respiratory tract immune responses against viruses,” said Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and senior author of the study. “These data imply that viral proteins in nasal spray may be used as a safe way to promote antiviral immunity at the site of viral entry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mechanism of nasal vaccines&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the mechanism of the nasal vaccines, the researchers first injected mice with a traditional mRNA COVID-19 shot, directly into the muscle. Later, they gave the mice a booster vaccine through the nose. The researchers wanted to see the effects of vaccine boosters that don’t contain special ingredients known as adjuvants. This ingredient is used in some vaccines, to help stimulate a stronger, longer-lasting immune response.However, they can also have adverse effects, like inflammation and swelling of facial nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We call this vaccine strategy ‘prime and spike’, which is where the mice were intramuscularly primed with mRNA vaccines followed by a nasal boosting with unadjuvanted spike protein,” Dong-il Kwon, a postdoctoral fellow in Yale’s Department of Immunobiology, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘prime and spike’ vaccine approach jumpstarts the immune response in the respiratory system, the first part of the body infected by COVID-19. ‘Prime’ refers to the process of administering a traditional intramuscular vaccine shot, while ‘spike’ refers to a follow-up vaccination delivered to the nose, usually in the form of a spray containing coronavirus-derived spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that only the nasal booster triggered a strong local immune response. Other boosters, including intramuscular injection, didn’t produce much IgA or activate immune cells in the lungs of the mice. When the researchers gave the mice a second nasal booster, their IgA levels increased even more in both the lungs and nasal passages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings help explain why nasal boosters do not require adjuvants to induce robust mucosal immunity at the respiratory mucosa and can be used to design safe and effective vaccines against respiratory virus pathogens,” Kwon added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular COVID-19 shots don’t create much IgA in the nose and lungs. This is why people can still get infected or pass it on, even if they’re vaccinated. However, this study found that nasal boosters can trigger strong, long-lasting immune protection where respiratory diseases like COVID-19 first attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how this safe and simple nasal booster promotes protective mucosal immunity will make it easier to develop this approach for human use in the near future,” Iwasaki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 01:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAJBVV95cUxOYjhXLVJZS1JQemFpMk5NeFIySzJqTTNjd2F2UnVBNUtidXcxZFN2TmFGb0hTcGVXamZ6cF9RcVlPNllIRlFEX1hHckZfOVZZUWdHVHd5eUMycV9WcTJqVHRVcmFFdmZXM1pPLUlKV1dGTTYzTWRna2FPNTZBYjJTOGtURk91UkpoZi1kRVhVaUt4YndidkpCX2Zrc3hwRE5lNV9LV3pWNXprRFJVVkRGU2phTFktMzdyTFJVb0FQbnpITkR4eGd5WmRvZzRvMVFzWWtVX0Fja0pzNVQ0TjVKT3A1b2VjWmpkUk8yT25LbjJPSjBHVlNWNzVHWWt4eDRzbHA2akNxUjRwRl9PSVFjRWp5LVpaU2Z5UnVWVnIzNlQ</guid></item><item><title>发现新的西澳麻疹病例-《西雅图时报》 | New WA measles case identified -

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nearly half of American adults have high blood pressure—a preventable and treatable risk factor for heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news is, changes to your diet and lifestyle habits can help lower your blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease, and the DASH diet is a great place to start. Plus, you can shop for everything you need at your favorite neighborhood big box store—Costco!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike ultra-restrictive fad diets, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; encourages:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned tuna is a convenient, affordable way to incorporate more protein into your meals and snacks. “Tuna is also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Eating healthy omega-3 fats like DHA and EPA is linked to lower blood pressure. Plus, studies show that eating a variety of proteins from different sources—think meat, fish, beans and whole grains—can lower the risk of developing high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Safe Catch Ahi Tuna is a convenient option available at Costco. It stands apart from other tuna brands because it guarantees a mercury level lower than the FDA action limit,” adds Manaker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-dill-tuna-salad-8684016" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lemon-Dill Tuna Salad&lt;/a&gt; between two pieces of whole-wheat bread as a sandwich or with tender Bibb lettuce. One serving has almost 30 grams of protein and less than 500 milligrams of sodium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-unsalted-mixed-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Unsalted Mixed Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Kirkland Signature unsalted mixed nuts are a great pantry staple to keep on hand for those looking to control or lower their blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://theeverydaykidneycook.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beverly Garden, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 1-ounce serving contains no sodium, making it a great snack choice. About 70% of the sodium in our diet comes from packaged and processed foods, like many convenient snack foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  There’s also 190 mg of potassium in a serving. That’s only about 5% of your daily needs but it’s still an added benefit, especially as a sodium-free snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that consuming enough potassium, about 4,700 mg daily, is key to promoting healthy blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to Garden, a potassium-rich diet can help manage blood pressure in two simple ways. First, it helps your body eliminate extra sodium through urine, which can reduce blood pressure. Second, potassium helps blood vessels relax, making it easier for blood to flow and lowering pressure in the blood vessels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts are also a good source of fiber, and eating a high-fiber diet is associated with lower blood pressure,”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says Garden.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Costco is a great place to buy affordable, high-quality oils for cooking and salad dressings,” says &lt;a href="https://www.danataylornutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dana Taylor, M.P.A., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “Look for extra-virgin olive oil, which supports healthy blood pressure, heart health and has anti-inflammatory properties.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that olive oil’s high oleic acid and antioxidant polyphenol content are beneficial for lowering blood pressure, and that’s why it’s often recommended as one of the best fat choices for hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kirkland Signature Organic Quinoa is a dietitian-approved Costco favorite for lowering blood pressure. “With 3 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein per serving, quinoa makes a great addition to any salad, grain bowl or stir-fry,” says &lt;a href="https://bewellnutritioncounseling.com/about/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ana Pruteanu, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming a diet high in fiber, at least 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men daily, can help you manage high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Gut microbes digest fiber, which creates short-chain fatty acids, health-promoting compounds with antihypertensive effects,” explains Pruteanu. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many ways to boost your fiber intake with quinoa. The versatile gluten-free grain can be used in everything from grain bowls—try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269844/vegan-superfood-grain-bowls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vegan Superfood Grain Bowl&lt;/a&gt; recipe—to healthy dessert recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250690/almond-butter-quinoa-blondies/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Almond Butter-Quinoa Blondies&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t leave Costco without snagging the Kirkland Signature Three Berry Blend from the freezer aisle. “Berries are packed with potassium and fiber, which play a key role in lowering blood pressure,”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Forget about molding berries in the crisper drawer of your fridge. Frozen berries are incredibly versatile and have a longer shelf life than their fresh counterparts. “You can toss them into Greek yogurt, blend them into a smoothie or even stir them into oatmeal for a heart-healthy, antioxidant-rich boost,” recommends Imus. Check out these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8031379/dietitian-favorite-recipes-with-frozen-berries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;14 Recipes That Start with a Bag of Frozen Berries&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, recommends stocking up on Whole Grain Rolled Oats at Costco. “Each serving contains 4 grams of fiber or 14% of the recommended daily value. Plus, they’re sodium-free, making them an excellent choice for someone looking to reduce the overall amount of sodium in their diet.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that people who consumed whole-grain oats effectively reduced systolic blood pressure compared to people who consume refined grains. This was especially true in individuals with hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Costco is a great place to buy heart-healthy salmon. Whether it’s canned salmon or fresh, and both offer blood pressure-lowering benefits. “Go for the Kirkland Signature Wild Alaskan pink salmon,” says &lt;a href="http://www.soundbitesnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “While these cans come in 6-ounce portions, they can be split to make two servings or shared with a friend.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a healthy diet like the DASH diet is one way you can manage your blood pressure. Other lifestyle factors that help lower blood pressure include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated.&lt;/strong&gt; “Dehydration can cause the blood vessels to constrict, decreasing blood flow and raising blood pressure,” says Kolesa. The general rule of thumb is 64 ounces of water per day, but some people may need more depending on factors like activity level, health conditions, age and sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving. &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for about 30 minutes daily or 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly. Try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-exercise-for-better-blood-pressure-8619767" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;#1 Exercise You Should Be Doing for Better Blood Pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;Get at least seven hours of sleep per night for healthy blood pressure and disease prevention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Costco has a variety of heart-healthy ingredients to help lower your blood pressure. Aside from adding these dietitian favorites to your Costco cart, try following the DASH diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly and prioritizing sleep to help keep your blood pressure down.&lt;br&gt;

It's the meningitis B vaccine currently given to babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the bacteria that cause the two diseases are so closely related that the MenB jab appears to cut gonorrhoea cases by around a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That will require a delicate conversation in sexual health clinics as the vaccine will not eliminate the risk of catching gonorrhoea. It is normally caught while having sex without a condom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Prof Andrew Pollard, the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which recommended the vaccine, said despite it only being 30% effective, it was "worth having" and could have "a huge impact" overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The decision is not just about the record numbers of cases. Gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most cases are treated with a single dose of antibiotics, but there is an 80-year history of the bacterium which causes gonorrhoea repeatedly evolving resistance to our antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's happening to the current treatments too and is why some doctors &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/antibiotic-resistant-gonorrhoea-cases-rising-in-england#:~:text=Katy%20Sinka%2C%20Consultant%20Epidemiologist%20and,pelvic%20inflammatory%20disease%20and%20infertility" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are concerned gonorrhoea could one-day become untreatable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The best way to deal with a drug-resistant infection is to never catch it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Amanda Doyle, from NHS England, said: "The launch of a world-first routine vaccination for gonorrhoea is a huge step forward for sexual health and will be crucial in protecting individuals, helping to prevent the spread of infection and reduce the rising rates of antibiotic resistant strains of the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The people most affected by gonorrhoea in the UK are those aged 16-to-25, gay and bisexual men, and those of black and Caribbean ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vaccine – which costs around £8 per dose – is value for money when primarily offered to gay and bisexual men, rather than all teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, clinicians do have the freedom to use their own judgement and offer the vaccine to people using sexual health services they think are of equally high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;People will be offered mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), HPV and hepatitis vaccines at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Matt Phillips, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: "This is excellent news and a landmark moment for sexual health in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Gonorrhoea diagnoses are at their highest since records began and this has the potential to help us to turn that around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is not known how long the protection provided by the vaccine will last or how often booster jabs might be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The decision comes almost a year and a half after a vaccination programme was recommended by the UK's JCVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sexual health campaigners had criticised that long wait, but have welcomed this decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Katie Clark, head of policy and advocacy at the Terrance Higgins Trust, called it a "huge win".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Listen to Newsbeat &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_one" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkry/episodes/player" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:13:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1rVDdtYUhSZjV3emMtWFlWVWZ0RDhvSjdSWTJ5ekdHVk55anFXbEJhNnpSVElkWnluNzhxVW9EbWl0cXlpdXYtNGxlNWlFMGs5M2RsX21QQlpEd9IBX0FVX3lxTE13d1pVRVh3MmJmcnE3N2E5c0RlYS1kbExpTDNVbDJ2OTJxREN1Rk0xTHBtMlNORzl4VFBfVjF4YUNzMm5qWFdUSmtxMDRjRkJkX0p2YUtyS1U3S1c4dTZJ</guid></item><item><title>红肉对心脏有害吗？这可能取决于谁资助了这项研究。-《纽约时报》 | Is Red Meat Bad for Your Heart?

Processed meats like bacon and sausage have consistently been linked with heart disease risk, he said, but the evidence for unprocessed red meats like steaks and pork chops has been “far more mixed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The question is timely, as influential people like the U.S. health secretary, Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;“The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) is alerting residents about potential exposures associated with a newly identified case of measles in a non-NJ resident who attended a concert in NJ while infectious,” officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning was issued for those who attended Shakira’s concert on Thursday night into Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said that potentially exposed individuals “could develop symptoms as late as June 6.” Those could include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a facial or hairline rash that tends to appear within five days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-papQS7n5" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_papQS7n5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where in the stadium the infected person was seated, where they live and how they arrived to the concert isn’t clear. Due to a &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/18/nj-transit-strike-over-tentative-agreement-reached/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Jersey Transit strike that’s since been resolved&lt;/a&gt;, Garden State buses and trains were not operating when Shakira performed, though Coach USA buses brought some passengers from Port Authority to New Jersey for the shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While vaccinations protect against measles, the World Health Organization says there’s&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; no specific treatment&lt;/a&gt; for the very preventable yet highly infectious virus. The New York State Department of Health has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;five cases of measles in New York City&lt;/a&gt; and six cases outside the five boroughs so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem’s much worse in Texas, where 722 people had tested positive as of Tuesday. &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/measles-outbreak-second-child-dies-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Two unvaccinated children&lt;/a&gt; with no underlying health conditions have &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/measles-death-texas-outbreak-first-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;died from measles&lt;/a&gt; since late February, according to health officials in the Lone Star State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that eating foods with live microbes may have benefits for those with hypertension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more microbe-rich foods may also counteract the effect of being sedentary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fermented foods like kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and some yogurts contain live microbes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a common health issue that affects millions of people worldwide and can lower both the quality and length of life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Finding ways to lower the risks for those with hypertension is very important—that’s why researchers recently undertook a new study to determine if live microbes could be beneficial for those dealing with high blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Including certain live microorganisms in your diet through foods or supplements (like probiotics) has become a promising way to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; and improve heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fermented foods like kefir, kimchi and some yogurts can be good sources of live microbes. In this new study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers looked at how both dietary live microbes and sedentary behavior can affect people with hypertension.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have a desk job, spend your days driving or prefer to spend your weekends hanging out on the couch, sitting for long periods can easily become a normal part of everyday life. But too much sedentary time can have serious impacts on heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, long periods of sitting can harm the health of your blood vessels. When we sit too much, the normal function of the cells lining our blood vessels gets disrupted. This can make it harder for the blood vessels to relax and work properly, which raises blood pressure and contributes to other health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Large-scale studies on human populations are still needed to confirm whether reducing sedentary behavior—and consuming live microbes—can effectively manage high blood pressure in the long term. This study in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; aims to bridge that knowledge gap—let’s unpack what it found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To investigate the association between dietary microbes intake and sedentary behavior with mortality risk in adults with high blood pressure in the United States, researchers used information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database, which was designed to gather important details about the health and nutrition of people living in the U.S. More than 15,000 individuals with hypertension were included in the analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study looked at how much live microbes people consumed in their diets and how that might connect to a sedentary lifestyle. The researchers suggest that most sterile or processed foods don’t contain many live microorganisms, while fresh fruits and vegetables with their skins on have moderate amounts. Foods like yogurt or fermented vegetables often have the highest levels of live microbes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To measure this, participants shared what they ate over a 24-hour period, and foods were grouped based on their microbe content. The groups included low microbe intake (mostly processed or sterile foods), moderate intake (some fresh produce) and high intake (fermented or unprocessed foods with lots of microbes). Participants were then categorized into one of these three groups based on their food choices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand how much time people spent sitting each day, researchers used a simple questionnaire called the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Interviewers asked participants about their daily sitting time, including activities like working at a desk, commuting in a car or on public transportation, watching TV, reading or using a computer. Based on their answers, participants were grouped into three categories of sitting time: less than five hours per day, five to eight hours per day, or more than eight hours per day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To examine survival outcomes, researchers used existing health data to understand who was still alive by the end of the study period, which concluded at the end of 2019. Additional factors like diet, use of probiotics and salt intake were considered for a more detailed analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After analyzing the available data, the researchers found that people who ate the least live-microbe foods had a higher risk of death from all causes and heart disease, while those who ate the most had a lower risk. Additionally, those who spent fewer than five hours a day sitting had the lowest risk of death, but people who sat for five to eight hours and those who sat for more than eight hours had similar risks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To better understand how diet and sitting time affect health, researchers investigated the link between diet, sedentary lifestyle and health outcomes further. They found that sitting for long hours was linked to a higher risk of death. Specifically, for every extra hour spent sitting, the risk of dying from any cause went up by 6%, and the risk of dying from heart problems increased by 6.5%. On the other hand, eating more live-microbe foods was protective. People with medium or high intake of live-microbe foods had significantly lower risks of death compared to those who ate very little. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the study revealed a “U-shaped” relationship between sitting time and the risk of death from all causes. This means that both very low and very high amounts of sitting are linked to higher health risks, while moderate sitting—around four hours a day—appears safer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When they split the participants into two groups—one that sat for more than 4.1 hours a day and one group that sat for less—they found that for those in the more-sitting group, eating live-microbe foods was especially beneficial. For individuals who did sit longer, eating moderate or high amounts of those foods helped lower their risk of heart-related deaths significantly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though a clear link between eating these foods and lower overall death risk wasn’t found for all groups, the general trend showed that people who ate more live microbe-rich foods tended to have better health outcomes. These findings underline how combining less sitting with healthier food choices may be beneficial for people with high blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few key study limitations to keep in mind. First, while the authors based their classification of dietary live microbes on widely accepted expert guidelines found in many studies, the actual amount of microbes in different foods wasn’t precisely measured, which could lead to some inaccuracies in the analysis. Second, the data used about diet and activity levels comes from self-reported surveys, meaning people may not always remember or report their eating and sitting habits accurately. Additionally, the study focuses only on people in the U.S., who may have different lifestyles, healthcare access, and genetics than people in other parts of the world, people should be cautious about applying these findings globally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high blood pressure, the study's findings suggest that taking certain steps in your daily habits may offer some benefits. By reducing sitting time to less than 4.1 hours per day, you may lower their risk of death, particularly from heart-related issues, based on these results. Incorporating more live microbe-rich foods (like yogurt, fermented vegetables and fresh produce with skins) into your diet also appears to support heart health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while live microbes may sound like an intimidating eat, they’re actually pretty easy to ease into. Start with a recipe like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Berry Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for a snack or a light breakfast. Make your day a little more savory by adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250931/simple-sauerkraut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; to your sandwiches. And if you prefer a  make-ahead treat, prep our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-raspberry-frozen-yogurt-bites-11687804" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lemon-Raspberry Frozen Yogurt Bites&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy them on a piping hot day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; highlights the importance of small, actionable lifestyle changes that may make a significant impact on the health of those living with high blood pressure. Reducing the time spent sitting each day and incorporating more live microbe-rich foods into your diet may offer protective benefits for heart health and overall longevity. These findings emphasize that even gradual adjustments to daily routines, like standing up more frequently or adding a serving of fermented vegetables to your meals, could prove valuable in managing health risks associated with hypertension.

              &lt;p&gt;Some common germs might plant the seed for dementia later in life. Research out today has found a link between several infectious diseases, particularly herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1), and a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Gilead Sciences conducted the study, &lt;a href="http://press.psprings.co.uk/Open/may/bmjopen093946.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in BMJ Open. They analyzed the medical records of Americans with health insurance, finding that people with Alzheimer’s and related conditions were also more likely to be diagnosed with HSV-1. The findings are the latest to suggest that the prevention and treatment of HSV-1 and similar viruses can be an effective measure against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, affecting roughly 7 million Americans today. Most cases are caused by a complex mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. In recent years, many studies have suggested that certain infections—HSV-1 included—can be part of that equation. HSV-1 is the primary cause of oral herpes, commonly known as cold sores, though most infected people will experience few or no symptoms; it can also cause genital herpes (primarily caused by HSV-2).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187874792300716X?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; has supported this viral link, however, so the authors decided to take a look for themselves, with the help of real-world data. According to lead researcher Luke Liu, this is the first study to use a large database of insurance claims in the U.S. to examine the connection between Alzheimer’s and HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liu and his team compared the health outcomes of nearly 400,000 Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to people without Alzheimer’s who were matched in age, sex, and other factors. Only a small percentage of people with Alzheimer’s had a past HSV-1 diagnosis (a bit under 0.5%), but they still had it more often than controls (about 80% more likely).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at a broader group of people with other forms of dementia related to Alzheimer’s, finding a similar pattern. They additionally found a link between Alzheimer’s and two other herpesviruses, herpes simplex-2 and varicella zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox and shingles. Interestingly, they also found that people who took antiviral treatment for their HSV-1 were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than people with HSV-1 who didn’t receive treatment (antivirals can suppress and shorten active outbreaks, though not cure the infection).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observational studies like this one can’t prove a cause-and-effect link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s, but the case for such a connection only appears to be getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Exposure to herpesviruses is likely to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia, and antiherpetic medications can be protective against Alzheimer’s and related dementia,” Liu, a virologist at Gilead, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There remain important questions about this association, including the actual mechanisms involved. Some research has suggested our brain’s immune system produces &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2818%2930526-9"&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.pitt.edu/news/herpes-virus-might-drive-alzheimers-pathology-study-suggests"&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; to defend against herpesvirus infection, for instance (the misfolded forms of these proteins are the key drivers of Alzheimer’s). But there might be more ways that HSV-1 and similar viruses can set off or accelerate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Other factors almost certainly play a role, especially since many people contract HSV-1 in their lifetime but never develop Alzheimer’s. Roughly two-thirds of the world’s population under age 50 &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;carries&lt;/a&gt; HSV-1, according to the World Health Organization. The researchers note that the HSV-1/Alzheimer’s link is even stronger in older people, and other research suggests that people carrying the ApoE-ε4 allele—a genetic variant that already increases Alzheimer’s risk—also seem more susceptible to HSV-1 infection. So these viruses are likely one of the many dominos that can fall and eventually lead to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the overall evidence does indicate that people can meaningfully lower their dementia risk by treating or preventing certain infections. Several studies have found a link between &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;shingles vaccination and reduced Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Clinical trials testing whether antiviral treatments for herpes can lower dementia risk could be warranted, though Liu notes that kind of research will take considerable resources to get off the ground. Research is also ongoing to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8691362/"&gt;develop vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for HSV-1 and HSV-2—research that might be more worthwhile than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpesviruses as a public health priority,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptomatic infection with the virus responsible for cold sores around the mouth–herpes simplex 1, or HSV-1 for short—may have a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, suggests a large US study published in &lt;i&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;But treatment with antiviral therapy seems to be linked to a lower risk of this type of dementia, suggesting that treatment to quell HSV-1 symptoms may be protective, the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, around 35.6 million people worldwide live with dementia, and 7.7 million new cases are diagnosed every year, say the researchers. Alzheimer's disease comprises 60%–80% of all dementias, with total costs for its treatment reaching US$305 billion in 2020, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various infectious agents have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease, and the most studied of these is HSV-1, which affected more than two-thirds of under 50s around the globe in 2016 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed further light on the mooted role of HSV-1 in Alzheimer's disease and the potential protective effects of antiherpetic drugs, the researchers drew on a large set of US administrative claims data (IQVIA PharMetrics Plus) for the period 2006–21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease were matched for age, sex, geographical region, database entry year, and number of health care visits with those without any history of neurological disease, resulting in a total of 344,628 case–control pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer's disease were women. Their average age was 73 and they tended to have more co-existing conditions—all &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/risk+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, 1,507 (just under 0.5%) people with Alzheimer's disease had been diagnosed with HSV-1 (0.44%) compared with 823 (just under 0.25%) of those in the comparison (control) group.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the risk of Alzheimer's disease rose in tandem with age. But, overall, the likelihood of an HSV-1 diagnosis was 80% higher among those with Alzheimer's disease, after adjusting for potentially influential factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 2,330 people with a history of HSV-1 infection, 931 (40%) used antiherpetic medication after their diagnosis. And they were 17% less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who didn't use these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at the potential role of other herpes viruses, including HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Both HSV-2 and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/varicella+zoster+virus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;varicella zoster virus&lt;/a&gt; infections were also associated with a heightened risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how HSV-1 and other neurotropic viruses might heighten the risk of dementia isn't clear, point out the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, studies have shown that inflammatory alterations in the brain caused by HSV infection are pivotal in [Alzheimer's disease] development," they explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has been reported that Aβ peptides are deposited in response to HSV infection and protect host cells by blocking viral fusion with the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/plasma+membrane/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;plasma membrane&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to HSV as a potential risk factor for [Alzheimer's disease]. Consistently, Aβ exhibits antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including HSV-1," they add.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;HSV-1 DNA is also found in the plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, and people carrying the ApoE ε4 allele, the most common genetic risk factor for the disease, are more susceptible to HSV infections, they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that HSV-1 infections before the patient's inclusion in the database weren't known, added to which many people with the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/infection/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt; don't have symptoms, while others might not seek treatment when they do–all factors that might influence the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their findings are in line with those of other studies. And they suggest, "While the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; remain to be fully elucidated, these results are indicative of a possible role for antiherpetic therapy in mitigating dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude, "These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpes viruses as a public health priority."&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers have learned that the brain’s protective coating of sugars loses some of its heft with age, and that this sugar loss might undermine the brain’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate &lt;a href="https://chemistry.stanford.edu/people/carolyn-bertozzi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carolyn Bertozzi&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, became curious about this sugary armor and looked into whether replenishing it could tighten the brain’s protective barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That barrier, called the blood-brain barrier, is designed to let in necessary &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-foods-with-these-key-nutrients-will-dramatically-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt; while blocking harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shift-in-the-sweet-layer"&gt;Shift in the sweet layer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sugar coat, known as the glycocalyx, sits on cells that form the blood-brain barrier. A recent study in mice found that the glycocalyx becomes thinner over time, leaving gaps that invite unwanted molecules to slip in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re stepping outside for the first time and trying to make sense of what’s out there,” said Carolyn Bertozzi, referencing how little attention sugar molecules have received compared to more commonly studied proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worry is that even minor openings can let inflammatory molecules and other damaging factors spread through the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-for-hours-daily-shrinks-your-brain-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;. Over the long run, that infiltration can potentially &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diminish memory&lt;/a&gt; and other cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-sugar-layers-step-up-the-defense"&gt;Brain sugar layers step up the defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists realized that reintroducing key sugar components helped recover some lost protection. These sugar additions seemed to restore the boundary and slow ongoing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Modulating glycans has a major effect on the brain – both negatively in aging, when these sugars are lost, and positively, when they are restored,” explained lead researcher &lt;a href="https://biox.stanford.edu/people/sophia-shi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sophia Shi&lt;/a&gt;, from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting the supply of specific sugars supported the barrier’s integrity in older mice. That allowed fewer damaging molecules to enter the brain and showed hints of improved brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that addressing this sugar gap in the glycocalyx gave the animals a better shot at memory recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-on-the-line"&gt;Memory on the line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work lays the foundation for a new field of inquiry into how the aging brain loses its resilience,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/tony-wyss-coray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tony Wyss-Coray&lt;/a&gt;, from Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain tests of learning and recall showed that mice with replenished sugar layers performed better at certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; tasks for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small gains can mean a lot when fighting cognitive decline. Scientists have long searched for fresh ways to help people fend off the forgetfulness that comes with advanced age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that a few sugars can shore up such a crucial brain barrier adds a new angle to that search. Many existing therapies attempt to stop buildup of harmful proteins, so a sugar-based approach is a different track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-could-mean"&gt;What this could mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier poses a challenge for anyone developing medications. This barrier acts as a gatekeeper, but a weakened &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-007-0212-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt; also raises red flags, since it might let in bigger trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thicker sugar layer could fine-tune how well the barrier behaves, keeping the brain safe yet still admitting vital substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery might influence how researchers design treatments, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neuroinflammation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt; and conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. If a failing sugar shield is a factor in disease progression, adjusting it could help keep the brain in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-the-brain-region-responsible-for-consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;better shape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-discoveries-lead-next"&gt;Where discoveries lead next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertozzi, Shi, and their colleagues plan to sort out which sugar types have the most impact. They also aim to figure out how these sugars interact with other protective molecules. The researchers suspect there could be multiple targets for preserving or replenishing the glycocalyx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is certain exactly how it might work in humans yet, but many age-related vulnerabilities revolve around the same principle of barrier instability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved knowledge of sugar biology could lead to novel therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively without causing harmful leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-sugar-health"&gt;Brain sugar health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for those who are younger, understanding how sugars stabilize the brain’s immune privileges may open up better strategies for warding off disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest that a well-kept glycocalyx might help people recover from infections or injuries involving the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-may-not-be-a-brain-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring these benefits requires further steps, and many labs are taking a fresh look at the glycocalyx as they learn more about its protective effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research offers a view into how aging brains manage the delicate balance between being open enough for nutrients yet closed off from harmful factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tuning that balance with added sugars, memory-related symptoms improved in mice. Studies are ongoing to see how much of that success will carry over to human patients, especially those with neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08589-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 21:19:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNc0ZKem42b0NMV21FNHJqQ09ETld0UTd4bmh6OEE3dU8xRlZnUXZ3LVJqY0Q4Q3l3Y0dmLVBZbHc3RFdZaFIwa2RHYzBpdXlXUkt3UGd2N0gwSG1Qd1BSLW8wMXkyYXRwQTRocVByUVFtbUM4aGhlY244bjNqdDB1Q2JDT3ZOZFY2ZUFBd0Rua3FrQmhoYnJDbTRFZUZnZ05jV1B0M09zSEhORFBLU1RXcw</guid></item><item><title>与语言相关的色彩知识-视觉大脑回路-神经科学新闻 | Color Knowledge Tied to Language-Visual Brain Circuitry - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE0zLVQzS1F2UXdiRGlJT05wUVVRZmFhbU04Z2VQeW5CUXBVaEQxd0FUVWlnQmZnd2wzSGRMTmZwcTdmWmx3Qnd6R1haYUt0MmFBVVY0a0JUSUZZV1NqQlJCQ2tJMHR2TjJudXdNMk5sQXZfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that our ability to recall details about familiar objects, like a banana’s typical color, depends on strong connections between visual and language-processing areas of the brain.&lt;/span&gt; Researchers found that stroke patients with disrupted neural pathways between these regions had weaker object-color knowledge and altered brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fMRI and diffusion imaging, the team showed that the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC), which processes visual details, works in tandem with language areas like the anterior temporal lobe.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s evidence that parts of the brain involved in language, like the dorsal anterior temporal lobe (ATL), are also involved in this process — dementia patients with ATL damage, for example, struggle with object color knowledge, despite having relatively normal visual processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand whether communication between the brain’s language and sensory association systems is necessary for representing information about objects, the authors tested whether stroke-induced damage to the neural pathways connecting these two systems impacted patients’ ability to match objects to their typical color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared color-identification behavior in 33 stroke patients to 35 demographically-matched controls, using fMRI to record brain activity and diffusion imaging to map the white matter connections between language regions and the VOTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that stronger connections between language and visual processing regions correlated with stronger object color representations in the VOTC, and supported better performance on object color knowledge tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects couldn’t be explained by variations in patients’ stroke lesions, related cognitive processes (like simply recognizing a patch of color), or problems with earlier stages of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that these results highlight the sophisticated connection between vision and language in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Our findings reveal that the brain’s ability to store and retrieve object perceptual knowledge—like the color of a banana—relies on critical connections between visual and language systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Damage to these connections disrupts both brain activity and behavior, showing that language isn’t just for communication—it fundamentally shapes how sensory experiences are neurally structured into knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the STI2030-Major Project (https://en.most.gov.cn/, 2021ZD0204100 (2021ZD0204104) to Y.B.), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/english/site_1/index.html, 31925020 and 82021004 to Y.B., 32171052 to X.S.W., 32071050 to X.Y.W.), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (http://en.moe.gov.cn/, to Y.B.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and visual memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c4e454340434b555c5e495f5f6c5c40435f02435e4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Claire Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Claire Turner – PLOS &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Object knowledge representation in the human visual cortex requires a connection with the language system&lt;/a&gt;” by Yanchao Bi et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object knowledge representation in the human visual cortex requires a connection with the language system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How world knowledge is stored in the human brain is a central question in cognitive neuroscience.

A large-scale study found that depressive symptoms and loneliness increased long before pain onset, suggesting mental health may play a causal role in later physical discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, adults without pain showed relatively stable emotional well-being over the same period. These findings highlight the importance of early mental health and social support to potentially prevent or delay chronic pain, especially in vulnerable populations with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression and loneliness worsened years before pain began in adults over 50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unequal Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The trend was strongest in people with lower income and education levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Early mental health and social interventions could reduce or delay pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle-aged and older adults who experience pain are more likely to have had worsening symptoms of depression up to eight years before the pain began, according to a new study by UCL (University College London) researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that among this age group, treatment for depression might help to prevent or reduce later aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared survey data from 3,668 adults aged over 50 who often experienced moderate to severe pain with a matched group of the same number who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110196"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also investigated if there was a link between social isolation and experiences of pain but, unlike with loneliness, found little difference in social isolation between the pain and non-pain groups. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the pain group, they found that depressive symptoms got rapidly worse in the eight years prior to pain, peaked at the onset of pain, and remained high in the years after, whereas in the non-pain group depressive symptoms were less severe, less prevalent, and relatively constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a similar trend for loneliness, which increased both in the years before and years after the onset of pain but stayed low and relatively constant for those in the non-pain group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the cause of the pain was not identified, most participants said they had pain in the back, knee, hip, or foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Mikaela Bloomberg (UCL Epidemiology &amp;amp; Public Health) said: “Pain and depression are known to be linked, with each exacerbating the other. But we don’t know about the timing of these related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that depressive symptoms and loneliness worsen long before pain begins. This is important as it suggests the potential for early mental health and social support to reduce or delay later pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Factors such as depression and loneliness can contribute to pain through several mechanisms. By inducing stress, they may increase inflammation, which can lead to pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They also may increase sensitivity to pain by changing immune responses and by dysregulating our autonomic nervous system, the network of nerves that control unconscious processes such as the ‘flight or fight’ response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of approaching pain not just from a biological perspective. Mental health interventions may be important too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data covering 21 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), in which a nationally representative population sample in England answers a wide range of questions every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that the sharp increase in depressive symptoms among participants who experienced pain was larger among people with less education and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely in part, the researchers said, because these individuals had fewer resources to support mental health and pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team said this finding pointed to the need to prioritise vulnerable populations with fewer socioeconomic resources with accessible mental health and community support programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated if there was a link between social isolation and experiences of pain but, unlike with loneliness, found little difference in social isolation between the pain and non-pain groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas loneliness is a subjective feeling of lacking social connections, social isolation indicates objective lack of contact with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team suggested that the quality of relationships, rather than the quantity of relationships or levels of social interaction, may matter in terms of mitigating against pain and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three quarters of the study participants in the pain group reported experiencing pain in the back, knee, hip, or foot. Of those remaining, 1.9% reported pain all over, 0.5% reported mouth or tooth pain, and 20.7% reported pain elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among study limitations, the research team noted that the participants were overwhelmingly white, reflecting the population of England in that age group. Future research, they said, should determine whether results are similar for younger groups and those with more racial and ethnic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They cautioned that the survey data did not distinguish between pain and chronic pain. However, they had consistent results when they restricted the analysis to participants who reported pain in successive surveys two years apart, suggesting the findings applied to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team adjusted for a wide range of factors that may have skewed the results – including participant sex, age, birth year, education, wealth, long term health conditions, physical activity level, alcohol consumption and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers received funding from the Nuffield Foundation’s Oliver Bird Fund and Versus Arthritis.

We examined trajectories of these outcomes before and after pain onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from participants aged ≥50 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Data collection began in 2002 (wave 1) and was repeated biennially until 2019 (wave 9); wave 10 took place in 2021/23. Participants who had data from at least 2 waves were included. Participants reporting pain between 2002 and 2023 (‘pain group’) were matched with an equivalent number without pain (‘no-pain group’; N = 7336 total).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychosocial outcomes were also assessed at each wave: Loneliness using the three-item subscale from the revised UCLA loneliness scale; social isolation using a score ranging from 0 to 5, with a higher score indicating more severe social isolation; and depression using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piecewise linear mixed models were used to produce trajectories of loneliness, social isolation, and depressive symptom scores before and after pain onset and during the comparable time period in the no-pain group. Subgroup analyses examined how results differed by age, sex, education, and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and depressive symptoms were more severe for the pain group than the no-pain group before pain onset (e.g., difference [pain-no pain] eight years before pain onset = 0.19 points, 95% confidence interval = 0.11–0.28 for loneliness; difference = 0.14, 0.06–0.22 for depressive symptoms). For loneliness, this difference increased consistently during the study period (e.g., difference = 0.33, 0.26–0.40 eight years after pain onset).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For depressive symptoms, the difference increased sharply to 0.58 (0.52–0.65) at pain onset and remained stable thereafter. Differences in depressive symptoms were most pronounced in less educated and less wealthy participants. There were negligible differences between pain and no-pain groups for social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and depressive symptoms progressively increased in severity years before pain onset.

The individual is considered unvaccinated because they were unable to provide documentation of receiving the measles vaccine. The individual was contagious beginning Thursday May 11, 2025, until May 19, 2025. The individual has received care, and public health officials are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;Individuals who were at the places at the times listed below may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this individual.&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While the individual was not considered infectious during visits to the listed locations before May 11, these locations are being included out of an abundance of caution due to the small possibility of early transmission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10, 2025 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:00 AM- 6:00 PM &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kohls – Sephora &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;20185 Marketplace Ave, Kyle, TX 78640 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10, 2025 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:00 AM- 6:00 PM &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;H-E-B Plus &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5401 Farm to Market 1626, Kyle, TX 78640 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13, 2025 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;11:47 AM- 2:23 PM &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CommuniCare- Kyle Clinic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;2810 Dacy Lane, Kyle, TX 78640 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 13, 2025 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:00 AM- 1:00 PM &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Texas Department of Public Safety &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1400 N IH 35, San Marcos, TX 78666 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 16, 2025 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;12:50 PM- 5:30 PM &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ascension Seton Hays &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6001 Kyle Parkway, Kyle, TX 78640 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In collaboration with DSHS, individuals who may have been exposed will be notified by their respective local health authority. HCHD, DSHS and other local health agencies are working closely together to investigate the potential contacts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our department has thoroughly prepared for the chance of a positive measles case within the county. We have learned from the many lessons identified from the measles exposure in February of this year,” Gonzales said. “We are working closely with the healthcare providers and businesses exposed to ensure the safety of their patients and customers. The health and safety of our residents is our priority. Our focus will be ensuring those who are exposed are notified and capable of taking the proper precautions for their health and to prevent the further exposure of other individuals.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HCHD will contact people who are known to have been in contact with the person who later tested positive for measles to provide guidance and conduct case investigations.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ninety percent of people who are not vaccinated or have not had a previous measles infection will become infected with the virus. If an individual has symptoms, they should contact their primary care provider, an urgent care or an emergency room to set up an appointment and quarantine for four days after the onset of a rash. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who were in the aforementioned locations during the specified times should: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class="defaultList bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles infection. People who have not had measles infection or received measles immunization previously may not be protected from the measles virus and should talk with a health care provider about receiving measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contact and notify their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant or have a weakened immune system regardless of vaccination history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash from four days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If symptoms develop, stay at home and avoid school, work and any large gatherings. Call a healthcare provider immediately. Do not enter a health care facility before calling and making them aware of your measles exposure and symptoms. The health department can assist healthcare providers in appropriately diagnosing and managing your care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-exposure prophylaxis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) refers to medical treatment given after someone has been exposed to a contagious disease, in this case measles, with the goal of preventing infection or reducing the severity of illness. PEP is most effective when administered as soon as possible after exposure and can significantly lower the risk of developing the disease. There are two primary forms of PEP for measles: the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine and immune globulin (IG), each appropriate for different situations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MMR Vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class="defaultList bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine can provide protection if administered within 72 hours (3 days) of the initial exposure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;This option is recommended for most healthy individuals aged 6 months and older who have not been fully vaccinated or whose immunity is uncertain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Globulin (IG)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class="defaultList bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;IG is a preparation of antibodies that provides temporary protection against measles. It can be administered after exposure to help prevent or lessen the severity of the disease, especially in people who are at higher risk of serious illness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Immune globulin (IG) may offer protection when given within 6 days of exposure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;IG is typically reserved for infants, pregnant individuals without immunity or those who are immunocompromised. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you think you may have been in close contact with someone who has measles and are unsure of your immunity: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class="defaultList bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible to find out if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is appropriate for you and which type (MMR vaccine or immune globulin) is best based on your age, health status, and vaccination history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can also call the Hays County Health Department at (512) 393-5520 for additional guidance or assistance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are a resident of Travis County who was exposed, please contact Austin Public Health at (512) 972-5555. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for two hours, even after the infected person has left. The infected person can spread the disease up to four days before a measles rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Common symptoms for measles include: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class="defaultList bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cough &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Runny nose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Red and watery eyes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The “measles rash” typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles can be prevented with a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR or MMRV). The MMR vaccine protects against three diseases: measles, mumps and rubella. The MMRV vaccine protects against four diseases: measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox). They are administered in two doses and are highly effective: two doses are 97% effective against measles and one dose is 93% effective. The spread of measles can be prevented if two-dose coverage of vaccine remains at 95% or above in the community.

Insured persons should check with their doctor or local pharmacy to see what vaccines are offered. Uninsured or underinsured children and adults can access free or low-cost vaccines at clinics enrolled in the Vaccines for Children (TVFC) and Adult Safety Net program (ASN). (See attached list of TVFC providers and qualifications for the TVFC program in Hays County). Individuals who do not qualify for TVFC and who do not have insurance can visit a Federally Qualified Health Center. The FQHC for Hays County is CommuniCare. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Hays County Health Department&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hays County Health Department is the local health authority for Hays County.

							&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;TRENTON, NJ –&lt;/span&gt; The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) is alerting residents about potential exposures associated with a newly identified case of measles in a non-NJ resident who attended a concert in NJ while infectious. Individuals – especially parents, guardians, health care providers, and caregivers – are urged to be aware of the symptoms of this highly contagious virus and to ensure they are up to date with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a rash that usually appears between three and five days after symptoms begin. The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet. Measles can also cause serious complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and can lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth, or a low-birth-weight baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NJDOH recommends that anyone who visited the following location only during the specified dates and times may have been exposed to measles. Anyone who suspects an exposure or illness is urged to call a health care provider BEFORE going to any medical office or emergency department. Special arrangements can be made for evaluation while also protecting other patients and medical staff from possible infection. Please do not visit a medical facility without calling ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location: MetLife Stadium, 1 MetLife Stadium Drive, East Rutherford, NJ 07073&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date &amp;amp; Time: From May 15, 2025, 7:30 PM through May 16, 2025, 1:00 AM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially exposed individuals, if infected, could develop symptoms as late as June 6, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the time of this release on May 20, no additional associated cases in New Jersey have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus spreads easily through the air when someone coughs or sneezes and can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. People can also get sick when they come in contact with mucus or saliva from an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals at risk include those who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMR vaccine, administered in two doses, is safe and the most effective way to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. The vaccine is also effective at preventing complications caused by these highly contagious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NJDOH encourages all residents to stay up to date on routine vaccinations, including &lt;a title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://csswewfbb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001XyRIVedGHG_PcGpjcEsDnfRlUb7ok2f8yDU1QV7nlSZWYGdiEAqKuK25Yvn7vx80uZ-n1NHyqr15YYoMyS9JFWDDIq_VIXRoT3wMfVBvjHAgO6qBVqUSUjeQn_CA4qohQ6Cu5sjnsvrkbPv3ttlSJVSN5z6V1NbDSJ3kjz6wW6SldhyuqpNVuQm-4ZdJr7nIXQ2CmU46ClLUyE-k-EaHAQ==&amp;amp;c=zxgVDnSR3i4vo2oYFFZunj9M_mU2xL5RWpNaBi948X1M-OkgRfiQWA==&amp;amp;ch=42VR5ohkVQL2Y1FIkIQ7yV8-uMIOUYqiti1cm1OmvwiGr2XujvwXpw==__;!!J30X0ZrnC1oQtbA!IL8PMBaq9im-dh8IzN6DSnc4JcRJbIgFkTyOiCGALYA41UjOZBPjcM0iSh8TZXERudCtGfJccmqu3BfJXSag0ZWYbtBVQJXMqKQ-$" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://csswewfbb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001XyRIVedGHG_PcGpjcEsDnfRlUb7ok2f8yDU1QV7nlSZWYGdiEAqKuK25Yvn7vx80uZ-n1NHyqr15YYoMyS9JFWDDIq_VIXRoT3wMfVBvjHAgO6qBVqUSUjeQn_CA4qohQ6Cu5sjnsvrkbPv3ttlSJVSN5z6V1NbDSJ3kjz6wW6SldhyuqpNVuQm-4ZdJr7nIXQ2CmU46ClLUyE-k-EaHAQ==&amp;amp;c=zxgVDnSR3i4vo2oYFFZunj9M_mU2xL5RWpNaBi948X1M-OkgRfiQWA==&amp;amp;ch=42VR5ohkVQL2Y1FIkIQ7yV8-uMIOUYqiti1cm1OmvwiGr2XujvwXpw==__;!!J30X0ZrnC1oQtbA!IL8PMBaq9im-dh8IzN6DSnc4JcRJbIgFkTyOiCGALYA41UjOZBPjcM0iSh8TZXERudCtGfJccmqu3BfJXSag0ZWYbtBVQJXMqKQ-$" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0"&gt;MMR shots&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone traveling internationally should be fully vaccinated &lt;a title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://csswewfbb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001XyRIVedGHG_PcGpjcEsDnfRlUb7ok2f8yDU1QV7nlSZWYGdiEAqKuK25Yvn7vx802-GxE7szmr0AZ5DfcPcwMWhTrR0TD-BQmdMqCJvd1qHvMRdwPBE3B3hCGQXQZDD4JdLJqhFjRB5DSlx-Tj-MyutvYyDuu9SxklVZMVj7Ze6ZY2gLPFt9fA==&amp;amp;c=zxgVDnSR3i4vo2oYFFZunj9M_mU2xL5RWpNaBi948X1M-OkgRfiQWA==&amp;amp;ch=42VR5ohkVQL2Y1FIkIQ7yV8-uMIOUYqiti1cm1OmvwiGr2XujvwXpw==__;!!J30X0ZrnC1oQtbA!IL8PMBaq9im-dh8IzN6DSnc4JcRJbIgFkTyOiCGALYA41UjOZBPjcM0iSh8TZXERudCtGfJccmqu3BfJXSag0ZWYbtBVQDbb_4Uh$" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://csswewfbb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001XyRIVedGHG_PcGpjcEsDnfRlUb7ok2f8yDU1QV7nlSZWYGdiEAqKuK25Yvn7vx802-GxE7szmr0AZ5DfcPcwMWhTrR0TD-BQmdMqCJvd1qHvMRdwPBE3B3hCGQXQZDD4JdLJqhFjRB5DSlx-Tj-MyutvYyDuu9SxklVZMVj7Ze6ZY2gLPFt9fA==&amp;amp;c=zxgVDnSR3i4vo2oYFFZunj9M_mU2xL5RWpNaBi948X1M-OkgRfiQWA==&amp;amp;ch=42VR5ohkVQL2Y1FIkIQ7yV8-uMIOUYqiti1cm1OmvwiGr2XujvwXpw==__;!!J30X0ZrnC1oQtbA!IL8PMBaq9im-dh8IzN6DSnc4JcRJbIgFkTyOiCGALYA41UjOZBPjcM0iSh8TZXERudCtGfJccmqu3BfJXSag0ZWYbtBVQDbb_4Uh$" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="1"&gt;before traveling&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;NJDOH is also requesting that health care providers use every opportunity to assess for immunizations to ensure all patients are current on routine immunizations. If referring a suspected measles case or exposed measles contact for care, health care providers MUST call the receiving facility to ensure appropriate arrangements are made. More guidance for health care providers regarding vigilance against measles can be found in the resources below:&lt;/p&gt;

After leaving the hospital, participants wore movement trackers on their wrists for 30 days. Researchers then followed up a year later to see if additional cardiac events or death occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that those who replaced 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with 30 minutes of light movement of any kind, such as a slow walk or house chores, had a 50% lower chance of having a second heart attack or cardiac event. When folks replaced 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with moderate or vigorous exercise, like a jog or bike ride, their chance of a second heart attack or cardiac event dropped by 61%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising find? Those who replaced sedentary behavior with 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/sleep-wellness" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="sleep" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6827913ae4b0a2fcab729e7f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/sleep-wellness" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; had a 14% lower chance of having a second heart attack or cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, you have options here.

Why is it good?’” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And it’s just considered to be a separate entity. It’s a healthful restorative behavior,” Diaz said. “It’s really helpful for things like inflammation and just recovery of your body at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting up and moving around is key for better heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to people who averaged fewer than 12 sedentary hours each day (not including sleep), folks who averaged more than 15 sedentary hours per day were 2.5 times more likely to have a cardiac event or die during the study’s one-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the important and actionable take-home message is [that]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sedentary behavior is deleterious. It’s bad for your health after a cardiac event,” said &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/sandeep-nathan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Sandeep Nathan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6827913ae4b0a2fcab729e7f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/sandeep-nathan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Dr. Sandeep Nathan&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of the cardiac intensive care unit and co-director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the University of Chicago Medicine’s Heart and Vascular Center. Nathan is not affiliated with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are limitations to this study. “These were patients who presented with ... acute coronary syndrome symptoms, but only about 25% of these patients actually had a solid diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome,” said Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, not everyone in this study actually had a heart attack; some just went to the emergency room for heart attack symptoms, like chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it doesn’t diminish the importance of the primary finding, which is that in anybody who comes in with a constellation of symptoms suggesting that they have heart disease, they do better with physical activity,” added Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also did not consider where study participants lived or their income, which are two factors that can also impact heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Tatiana Maksimova via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tatiana Maksimova via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Moderate to vigorous exercise, such as swimming, running or cycling, can lower your risk of a second heart attack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical activity has a range of benefits for heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscored a well-established notion: Physical activity of any kind is good for your heart. Overall, it improves your physical and cardiovascular conditioning, Nathan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate to vigorous exercise also helps control the factors that put you at risk of a heart attack or coronary event, said Nathan. It “decreases blood sugar levels, it decreases blood pressure. It perhaps helps you lose weight and improve your lipid profiles as well, and all of those are independent risk factors for a second cardiac event,” Nathan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then finally, what I always tell patients is that if you’re consistently maintaining a high level of physical activity, you have a warning system. You can tell me that, ‘Doc, I normally go 30 minutes on the treadmill, but for the past couple of weeks, I hit the 15-minute mark and I just don’t feel well,’” said Nathan. “That’s an early indicator that something’s amiss, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live a sedentary life, you can’t test your heart health the same way. In other words, changes to what you’re able to do in your regular fitness regimen can help indicate if you’re developing blockages or issues that could cause a second heart attack, said Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiac rehab is also a great tool for lowering your risk of a second heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that avoiding sedentary behavior is good for your cardiovascular health and your overall health. Beyond that, though, Nathan said it’s important for those who do have a heart attack to go to (and complete) cardiac rehab as prescribed, as it can help you from having a second heart attack or other cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so, when I counsel patients after a heart attack, I point that out to them,” Nathan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You may think that you can do this on your own, in your home gym, or in your basement, or your local fitness facility, but there is a substantial benefit to actually going to cardiac rehab and being pushed to engage in escalating intensity of activity for a period of about 12 weeks, typically,” Nathan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Most people have no symptoms, but the disease can put infants and people with weakened immune systems at risk for severe illness that can be chronic or deadly if untreated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the study, published last week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a team led by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the suspected histoplasmosis cluster affecting the family members, who lived in Georgia, Texas, and Washington state, in December 2024 and January 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Travel details raised suspicion &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of a 7-day vacation, on December 24, 12 of 13 family members in the travel group toured Venado Caves, a popular tourist destination in Alajuela province, in the north-central part of Costa Rica near Nicaragua's southern border. Six family members were aged 42 to 49 years, and six were aged 8 to 16.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All reported seeing bats and coming into contact with bat droppings while crawling through tight spaces during the 2-hour tour and became mildly or moderately sick after returning to the United States 8 to 19 days after the visit. Five adults and one child sought treatment at an urgent care or primary care center after experiencing symptoms but didn't mention any travel. The family member who didn't tour the cave didn't become ill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs and symptoms included headache, malaise, fever, night sweats, muscle pain, and respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. No other activities reported before, during, or after the trip were tied to risk factors for exposure to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; species. Four family members were tested for fungal antigens, with two of them positive for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; species complex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three patients received antibiotics, two were given corticosteroids, and one received a cough suppressant. One adult was referred to an emergency department and hospitalized because of abnormal chest radiographic findings that raised concerns about lung cancer. That patient was given antifungal medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the day after admission, healthcare providers who asked if the patient had recently traveled learned of the cave visit and began to suspect histoplasmosis. On January 17, a Georgia infectious disease physician notified the CDC of the cases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cave was associated with a histoplasmosis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/70/4/article-p438.xml"&gt;&lt;span&gt;outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 1998 and 1999 that sickened 51 people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;All patients improved within a month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On January 21, 2025, the CDC launched a multistate investigation of the 12 cases with the Georgia Department of Public Health, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Washington State Department of Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame," the researchers noted. "However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One patient with a positive test result also twice received positive complement fixation antibody test results. In addition to the patient with radiographic findings suspicious for lung cancer, another patient also had abnormal radiographic results characterized by pulmonary nodules and opacities consistent with histoplasmosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ill family members were classified as having confirmed (1 patient), probable (8), or suspected (3) histoplasmosis based on the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition. By day 28 post-exposure, all affected family members had recovered or were getting better, which the study authors said is consistent with mild or moderate histoplasmosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antibiotics, corticosteroids not recommended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC alerted health departments through an Epidemic Information Exchange notification to identify additional histoplasmosis cases and is working with the US Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health to add information about histoplasmosis risks into the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cavernasdelvenado.com/en/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the Venado Caves tour, which prominently features photos of bats, says that the cave is home to a colony of bats and that guests will be given a mask of an unspecified type but doesn't mention histoplasmosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On March 18, the US Embassy issued a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cr.usembassy.gov/health-alert-histoplasmosis-risks-from-caving-activities-march-18-2025/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;health alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to notify the public of the risk of contracting histoplasmosis from caving. Exposures to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;H capsulatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; at Venado Caves could be ongoing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) medications are ineffective, and corticosteroids might worsen fungal infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasmosis diagnoses are often delayed, and treatment guidelines recommend antifungal drugs for only severe histoplasmosis. "Antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) medications are ineffective, and corticosteroids might worsen fungal infections; prescription of these medications to certain affected family members suggests that fungal infections were not initially considered as the cause of the illness," the researchers wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Clinicians should consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis and should report suspected cases of histoplasmosis to local health departments as applicable," they concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

His work is motivated in part by what happened to a police officer he treated in 2002, just after completing his medical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The man arrived at the emergency room unconscious, in a coma. He had been in a terrible car crash while pursuing a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Two days later, Dr. Manley’s mentor said it was time to tell the man’s family there was no hope. His life support should be withdrawn. He should be allowed to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Manley resisted. The patient’s brain oxygen levels were encouraging. Seven days later the policeman was still in a coma. Dr. Manley’s mentor again pressed him to talk to the man’s family about withdrawing life support. Again, Dr. Manley resisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ten days after the accident, the policeman began to come out of his coma. Three years later he was back at work and was named San Francisco Police Officer of the Month. In 2010, he was Police Officer of the Year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“That case, and another like it,” Dr. Manley said, “changed my practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But little has changed in the world of traumatic brain injuries since Dr. Manley’s patient woke up. Assessments of who will recover and how severely patients are injured are pretty much the same, which results in patients being told they “just” have a concussion, who then have trouble getting care for recurring symptoms like memory lapses or headaches. And it results in some patients in the position of that policemen, who have their life support withdrawn when they might have recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine"&gt;Taurine&lt;/a&gt; is an amino acid occurring naturally in the body, and found in energy drinks as well as foods like fish and meat – and while it has certain &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/taurine/faq-20058177"&gt;benefits for the body&lt;/a&gt;, a new study suggests it's also an important fuel source for driving cancers such as leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the University of Rochester Medical Center (UR Medicine), the study analyzed the behavior of leukemia cells, finding that they could borrow taurine from the surrounding bone marrow and use it to grow more quickly. It gives these cells a growth jolt, similar to how we might get an alertness jolt from an energy drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers blocked taurine access in mouse models and transplanted leukemia cells from humans or mice,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161782" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; growth was suppressed. This suggests that targeting taurine could help in treatments for some cancer types, such as leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Local levels of taurine in bone marrow may enhance leukemia growth, suggesting caution in use of high-dose taurine supplementation," &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; oncologist Jane Liesveld, from UR Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's that supplementation, through sources such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/electrolyte-drinks-can-make-things-worse-when-youre-sick-heres-why"&gt;energy drinks&lt;/a&gt;, that the researchers are worried about. It's still early days in terms of joining these dots, but giving the body extra taurine might not be the best idea for stopping cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, further investigation into how this all works is going to be needed. It's not clear yet how this might work in humans, or how additional taurine outside of bone marrow might have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlaeEUNOHJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With different cancers though, there's a different context. Taurine is also known to boost the immune system in certain ways, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.03.011"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown this can help to fight off gastric cancers in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding more about the metabolism of cancers, and how they survive and thrive, is an increasingly significant part of cancer research. We know that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-major-cancer-causing-mutation-triggers-disease"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; can lead to cancers growing out of control, but it's not the only trick the disease has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161786" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161786" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/TaurineCells.jpg" alt="Cancer cells analysis" class="wp-image-161786 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/TaurineCells.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/TaurineCells-600x305.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161786" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how cancer cells grew with and without taurine. (Sharma et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, and we are at the very beginning of understanding metabolic effects on leukemia cells," &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liesveld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The prior focus has been on genetic changes, but the focus is expanding to understanding how leukemia cells are able to hijack various metabolic pathways for their own survival."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While energy drinks undoubtedly work as advertised – giving you a brief burst of energy – there are growing concerns around the health risks of these drinks, which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-energy-drink-could-increase-risk-of-heart-disease-experts-warn"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mixing-energy-drinks-with-alcohol-can-impair-brain-function-study-in-rats-shows"&gt;impaired cognition&lt;/a&gt; in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that cancer risks might be added to that list of potential downsides, although the high sugar and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="161782" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; content is probably a more pressing health concern than taurine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more significant about these discoveries is that cancer cells could be stopped by cutting off their energy diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"&gt;Myeloid cancers&lt;/a&gt; such as leukemia interfere with the normal functioning of blood cells, and they can be fast-moving and difficult to treat. Anything we can do to slow them down is likely to improve recovery rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="161782" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; and cancer biologist Jeevisha Bajaj, from UR Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A Kyle resident tested positive for measles but is no longer infectious, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" To my recollection, we have never had a true case of measles,"  Ian Harris, epidemiologist with the Hays County Health Department, said at a press conference Tuesday. "Never had a confirmed positive to my knowledge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with the Hays County Health Department said the individual received care and is feeling better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hays County Health Department said it is working on identifying and notifying people who may have been exposed to the infected person when they were contagious from May 11 to 19.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" This individual was not capable of providing us valid proof that they were immunized, so right now we are considering them unvaccinated," said Matthew Gonzales, the director for the Hays County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gonzales said the person is an adult and was exposed to the virus through an extended family member who visited them. At this time, the department can't confirm if the family member had measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county shared a list of dates and locations where the person may have exposed others to the virus:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kohls - Sephora, 20185 Marketplace Ave, Saturday, May 10, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;H-E-B Plus, 5401 Farm to Market 1626, Saturday, May 10, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CommuniCare - Kyle Clinic, 2810 Dacy Lane, Tuesday, May 13, 11:47 a.m. - 2:23 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Texas Department of Public Safety, 1400 N IH 35, Tuesday, May 13, 8 a.m. - 1 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ascension Seton Hays, 6001 Kyle Parkway, Friday, May 16, 12:50 p.m. - 5:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person wasn't considered infectious on May 10, but the county said it was listing those locations "out of an abundance of caution due to the small possibility of early transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials are advising people who were at the above locations during those time frames to check their medical records to see if they are protected against measles. They should also monitor for symptoms, which include fever, rash, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. People who are pregnant, have an infant or are immunocompromised should contact their health care provider for next steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline of vaccination rates in West Texas have led to a &lt;a href="https://www.kut.org/health/2025-04-08/texas-measles-outbreak-isnt-slowing-down-how-can-that-change" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, with cases popping up elsewhere in the state, including &lt;a href="https://www.kut.org/health/2025-02-28/austin-tx-measles-case-unvaccinated-vaccine" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Central Texas.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hayscountytx.gov/possible-measles-exposure-in-san-marcos" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;In February&lt;/a&gt;, the Hays County Health Department was notified about a visitor from Gaines County who tested positive for measles and took a tour of Texas State University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, Hays County officials don't believe the current case of measles is connected to the outbreak in Gaines County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that is especially dangerous for young children and people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually begin &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;7 to 14 days after infection&lt;/a&gt; and can first appear as flu-like symptoms. A measles rash appears three to five days after symptoms begin. &lt;/p&gt;

Without well-established prevention or cure, we would all agree that dementia is not the fault of the person who has it.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KYLE, Texas — A person in Kyle has tested positive for measles, Hays County officials confirmed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hays County Health Department (HCHD) said the person is "considered unvaccinated" because they were unable to provide documentation of receiving the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we want to do is stress the importance of getting vaccinated for measles," Matthew Gonzales, executive director of HCHD, said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person was contagious from Sunday, May 11, until Monday, May 19, and visited at least three public locations during that infectious period:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuesday, May 13: CommuniCare Kyle Clinic at 2810 Dacy Lane, from 11:47 a.m. to 2:23 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuesday, May 13: Texas Department of Public Safety at 1400 N. I-35, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friday, May 16: Ascension Seton Hays at 6001 Kyle Parkway, from 12:50 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person also visited two locations before the infectious period. HCHD officials said they included these locations out of an abundance of caution due to the small possibility of early transmission:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saturday, May 10: Sephora at Kohl's at 20185 Marketplace Ave., from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saturday, May 10: H-E-B Plus at 5401 FM 1626, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad timeframe on those days is due to the person's uncertainty of when they visited those locations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob Heymann is a Kyle resident who shops at the H-E-B Plus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's kind of wild. The measles is spreading, but it shouldn't be," Heymann said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person has received care, and public health officials are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our department has thoroughly prepared for the chance of a positive measles case within the county. We have learned from the many lessons identified from the measles exposure in February of this year,” Gonzales said. “We are working closely with the health care providers and businesses exposed to ensure the safety of their patients and customers. The health and safety of our residents is our priority. Our focus will be ensuring those who are exposed are notified and capable of taking the proper precautions for their health and to prevent the further exposure of other individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were in the above locations during the specified times should:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review their immunization records to determine if they are protected against measles infection. Those who have not had measles infection or immunization are urged to receive an MMR vaccine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor themselves for symptoms, including a fever and/or unexplained rash from four days to 21 days after their exposure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay at home and avoid school, work and any large gathering. Call a health care provider immediately and do not enter a health care facility before calling and making them aware of your measles exposure and symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time this year that there has been a measles exposure in Hays County. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/local/hays-county/hays-county-san-marcos-measles-exposure/269-42a46302-f24d-46af-af3e-98f0ee7f2f6b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;In February&lt;/a&gt;, HCHD officials said a person from Gaines County who developed measles had traveled to San Marcos. The person allegedly visited several spots around Valentine's Day, and &lt;a href="/article/news/local/hays-county/hays-county-san-marcos-measles-exposure/269-42a46302-f24d-46af-af3e-98f0ee7f2f6b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;they tested positive despite being previously vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has reported 722 cases of measles across the sate, most of which are part of a larger outbreak in the Gaines County area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure &amp;gt;1,000 serum and urine metabolites. Average daily UPF intake was estimated as percentage energy according to the Nova system. Partial Spearman correlations and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression were used to estimate UPF-metabolite correlations and build poly-metabolite scores of UPF intake, respectively. Scores were tested in a &lt;em&gt;post-hoc&lt;/em&gt; analysis of a previously conducted randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03407053) of 20 subjects who were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and randomized to consume &lt;em&gt;ad libitum&lt;/em&gt; diets that were 80% or 0% energy from UPF for 2 weeks immediately followed by the alternate diet for 2 weeks; eligible subjects were between 18−50 years old with a body mass index of &amp;gt;18.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and weight-stable. IDATA participants were 51% female, and 97% completed ≥4 ASA-24s. Mean intake was 50% energy from UPF. UPF intake was correlated with 191 (of 952) serum and 293 (of 1,044) 24-h urine metabolites (FDR-corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;-value &amp;lt; 0.01), including lipid (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 56 serum, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 22 24-h urine), amino acid (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 33, 61), carbohydrate (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4, 8), xenobiotic (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 33, 70), cofactor and vitamin (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9, 12), peptide (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7, 6), and nucleotide (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7, 10) metabolites. Using LASSO regression, 28 serum and 33 24-h urine metabolites were selected as predictors of UPF intake; biospecimen-specific scores were calculated as a linear combination of selected metabolites. Overlapping metabolites included (S)C(S)S-S-Methylcysteine sulfoxide (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.23, −0.19), N2,N5-diacetylornithine (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.27 for serum, −0.26 for 24-h urine), pentoic acid (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.30, −0.32), and N6-carboxymethyllysine (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.15, 0.20). Within the cross-over feeding trial, the poly-metabolite scores differed, within individual, between UPF diet phases (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;-value for paired &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; test &amp;lt; 0.001). IDATA S&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;udy participants were older US adults whose diets may not be reflective of other populations.&lt;/p&gt;

Poly-metabolite scores should be evaluated and iteratively improved in populations with a wide range of UPF intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" class="abstract toc-section abstract-type-summary"&gt;&lt;a id="abstract1" name="abstract1" data-toc="abstract1" class="link-target" title="Abstract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="abstract-content"&gt;
&lt;div id="section1" class="section toc-section"&gt;&lt;a id="sec025" name="sec025" class="link-target" title="Why was this study done?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why was this study done?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;ul class="bulleted"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Global production and availability of UPF is high, but accurately measuring UPF consumption is challenging.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Objectively measured metabolites in blood and urine that derive from the diet or response to dietary intake may be useful for studying UPF intake in epidemiologic studies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Complementary observational and experimental human studies provide a unique opportunity to develop and evaluate potential dietary biomarkers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="section2" class="section toc-section"&gt;&lt;a id="sec026" name="sec026" class="link-target" title="What did the researchers do and find?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did the researchers do and find?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;ul class="bulleted"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using a discovery metabolomics approach, we identified hundreds of serum and urine metabolites were correlated with percentage energy from UPF intake in 718 free-living adults with diverse dietary intakes who participated in the IDATA Study.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We developed and tested poly-metabolite scores that are predictive of UPF intake for blood and urine.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using metabolomics data generated previously in a randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial of two diets, one high in and the other void of UPF, we evaluated the IDATA poly-metabolite scores. The poly-metabolite scores differentiated, within individual, between the diets that were 80% and 0% energy from UPF.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="section3" class="section toc-section"&gt;&lt;a id="sec027" name="sec027" class="link-target" title="What do these findings mean?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do these findings mean?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;ul class="bulleted"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The identified poly-metabolite scores could serve as objective measures of UPF intake in large population studies to complement or reduce reliance on self-reported dietary data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Poly-metabolite scores, predictive of UPF intake, could provide novel insight into the role of UPF in human health.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Limitations: Study participants were older US adults whose diets may vary from other populations. Poly-metabolite scores should be evaluated and iteratively improved in populations with diverse diets and a wide range of UPF intake.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the United States, UPF accounts for more than 50% of calories consumed by children and adults [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref003" class="ref-tip"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref005" class="ref-tip"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;] raising concerns about the potential impact on human health. Epidemiological studies have linked UPF consumption to risk factors for chronic disease, such as weight gain and obesity [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref006" class="ref-tip"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref009" class="ref-tip"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;], as well as to risk of cardiometabolic diseases and certain types of cancer [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref007" class="ref-tip"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref010" class="ref-tip"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref012" class="ref-tip"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.p2" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most epidemiological studies on UPF consumption, have used the Nova system to classify food items based on their level of processing [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref001" class="ref-tip"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref012" class="ref-tip"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]. Accurate classification according to Nova necessitates detailed information on food sources, processing methods, as well as ingredients and their purposes. However, dietary assessment tools and databases capture this information to varying extents. Consequently, researchers may encounter challenges in accurately applying the Nova system, fueling concerns about exposure misclassification and comparability of study results [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref013" class="ref-tip"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref016" class="ref-tip"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that integrating biomarker data with dietary data, measured via self-report using validated assessment tools, can help to adjust for measurement error and improve the precision of diet-disease association estimates, thereby enhancing statistical power [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref017" class="ref-tip"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref018" class="ref-tip"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]. Metabolomics has been used to identify candidate biomarkers for various foods [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref019" class="ref-tip"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;], beverages [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref020" class="ref-tip"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;], and dietary patterns [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref021" class="ref-tip"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref023" class="ref-tip"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;], including a dietary pattern high in UPF [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref024" class="ref-tip"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref026" class="ref-tip"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;]. Previous studies have reported on cross-sectional UPF-metabolite associations [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref025" class="ref-tip"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref026" class="ref-tip"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;] and one tightly controlled feeding trial [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref024" class="ref-tip"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;] identified hundreds of blood and urine metabolites that differed, within individual, between a dietary pattern high in, compared to one void of, UPF; however, the study had a small sample size and limited menus. Currently, nutritional metabolomics research in population-based studies using validated assessment tools, and serial collection of blood and urine, for generating metabolomics data, is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary aims of this study were to identify serum and urine metabolites associated with average 12-month UPF intake, assessed using multiple 24-h dietary recalls, and to develop blood and urine poly-metabolite scores predictive of UPF intake in a free-living population of participants from the Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) Study. Our secondary aim was to test whether these poly-metabolite scores could, in the context of the aforementioned, previously conducted, randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial, differentiate, within individual, between diets containing 80% and 0% energy from UPF. We hypothesized that diets high in energy from UPF similarly impact the metabolome such that a poly-metabolite score developed in a free-living population will differentiate unprocessed and ultra-processed diet phases in the crossover-feeding trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IDATA study was designed to evaluate the performance of web-based dietary assessment tools, including the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24), using reference biomarkers. The IDATA Study design and methods have been described in detail elsewhere [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref027" class="ref-tip"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;]. In brief, IDATA participants were recruited from a list of AARP members, aged 50–74 years, who resided in or nearby Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, spoke English, had internet access, were not on a weight-loss diet, and were free of major medical conditions and mobility limitations. From 2012 to 2013, 1,082 participants were enrolled in the IDATA Study and provided biospecimens consent. The study was approved by the National Cancer Institute Special Studies Institutional Review Board (IRB approval number 11CN155) and is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03268577); all participants signed informed consent [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref027" class="ref-tip"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analytic sample included the 718 IDATA participants with dietary data, including at least one ASA-24, and available serum, 24-h urine, and first morning void (FMV) urine, collected at two time points, 6 months apart, for metabolomics analysis (&lt;a href="#pmed-1004560-g001"&gt;Fig 1&lt;/a&gt;).

Each group completed the same collection activities, although the timing varied [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref028" class="ref-tip"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. Over 12 months, participants completed up to six web-based ASA-24s on a randomly assigned day approximately every other month [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref027" class="ref-tip"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref028" class="ref-tip"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. Each food and beverage item reported was assigned to a unique 8-digit food code based on the foods and beverages reported in What We Eat in America (WWEIA), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The structure of the WWEIA dietary data has been described in detail elsewhere [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref029" class="ref-tip"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;]. Food codes were linked to the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref030" class="ref-tip"&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;], an application to convert food and beverage portions into gram amounts and to estimate nutrient values, including energy [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref029" class="ref-tip"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref031" class="ref-tip"&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;], using standard reference (SR) codes from the United States Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nova classification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPF intake was estimated according to the Nova system, which classifies foods and beverages into one of four groups based on the extent and purpose of industrial food processing. Group 1 items include unprocessed or minimally processed foods such as fresh, dried, or frozen fruits or vegetables, grains, legumes, meat, fish, and milk; group 2 items include processed culinary ingredients which are substances obtained from group 1 foods or from nature such as most plant oils, sugar, honey, and table salt; group 3 items include processed foods, which are made by adding group 2 ingredients to group 1 foods, such as canned vegetables, artisanal breads, and cheese; group 4 items are UPF and include ready-to-eat foods, like industrially manufactured breads and baked goods that contain ingredients not typically used in culinary preparations [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref001" class="ref-tip"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. Each ASA-24 food and beverage item was disaggregated into FNDDS food and SR codes, which were assigned to 1 of the 4 Nova groups based on the WWEIA, NHANES database developed by Martínez Steele and colleagues [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref029" class="ref-tip"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;]. FNDDS food codes (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 44) that had not been previously assigned to a Nova group, were reviewed and assigned a Nova classification using the “reference approach” described by Martínez Steele and colleagues [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref029" class="ref-tip"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;]. Next, we calculated total energy intake per day (i.e., total calories) by summing the calories from each of the four Nova groups for each participant per recall day. We then calculated the percentage of total energy intake from UPF (i.e., Nova group 4) for each participant per recall day and averaged percentage of total energy intake from UPF across the number of ASA-24 days completed for each IDATA participant. Average, 12-month percentage of total energy intake from UPF is subsequently referred to as UPF intake. The top 10 food codes contributing to energy intake from UPF accounted for about 12% of energy intake and include ice cream, white rolls, potato chips, and cola-type soft drinks (S1 Table).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Biological sample collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants visited the study center at months 1, 6, and 12 for assessment of anthropometry measures. During two of the center visits, either months 1 and 6 or months 6 and 12, participants had their blood drawn. Serum samples were kept at −28 °C and centrifuged within two hours for 15 min at 3,500 rpm prior to being stored at −70 °C. Participants were asked to complete 24-h urine collections at home. Urine collection days occurred approximately 7–10 days after a study center visit. Participants were asked to collect 100 mL of first morning void (FMV) urine, after which they began collecting urine for the next 24-h, including the first void of the next morning. The 24-h and FMV urine collections were delivered to the study center by courier. The urine was weighed, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C until being sent to the biorepository where it was also stored at −70 °C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Metabolomics analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolomic profiling of serum and urine samples was conducted at Metabolon, using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to measure a broad range of metabolites. These include endogenous metabolites such as amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, cofactors, vitamins, and intermediates of energy metabolism, as well as xenobiotics from exogenous sources such as food and drugs. Sample analysis and data processing, including peak alignment and compound identification, have been previously detailed elsewhere [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref020" class="ref-tip"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref032" class="ref-tip"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p2" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serum and urine samples were analyzed separately. For urine, osmolality measurements were performed by Metabolon using a Fiske 210 Osmometer from 20 μL of each sample. Subsequently, 50 μL of each urine sample was diluted (1:1) with 50 μL of ultrapure dH₂O, yielding a final volume of 100 μL. The 100 μL urine samples and all serum samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR system (Hamilton). Recovery standards were added, and proteins were precipitated with methanol, followed by vigorous shaking (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) and centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were dried and reconstituted in recovery solvents containing fixed concentrations of internal standards to ensure consistency across samples, particularly for urine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p3" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolon performed the analyses using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system coupled with a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometer, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source and an Orbitrap mass analyzer operating at a resolution of 35,000. The extracted metabolites were analyzed using multiple UPLC-MS/MS methods: two reverse-phase UPLC-MS/MS methods in positive ion mode ESI, one reverse-phase UPLC-MS/MS in negative ion mode ESI, and one hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-UPLC-MS/MS in negative ion mode ESI. The organic solvent was removed using the TurboVap system (Zymark Corporation). For positive ion mode analysis of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, samples were gradient-eluted from a C18 column using a mobile phase of water and methanol containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid and 0.1% formic acid. In negative ion mode, a separate C18 column was used, with elution performed using a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid, and 0.01% formic acid. An additional aliquot underwent analysis in negative ion mode following HILIC column separation (Waters UPLC Bridged Ethylene Hybrid Amide, 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 μm), using a gradient of water and acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium formate at pH 10.8. The mass spectrometry scan range covered 70–1,000 m/z, with all processes fully automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p4" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw data extraction and metabolite identification were conducted by matching ion chromatographic retention indices, mass-to-charge ratios (m/z), and mass spectral fragmentation patterns against a proprietary reference library of authentic standard spectra. Peak detection and integration were performed using software as previously described [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref020" class="ref-tip"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref033" class="ref-tip"&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref034" class="ref-tip"&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;]; workflows for setting thresholds for signal-to-noise ratio, peak area, and width were derived from open-source references [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref033" class="ref-tip"&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;]. To remove batch variability, for each serum and urine metabolite, the raw values were batch-normalized, giving each batch and each metabolite a median of one. Urine measures were divided by their osmolality value and re-scaled to have a median of one. Finally, for each metabolite, the minimum value across all batches in the median scaled data was imputed for the missing values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blinded, replicate, QC serum and urine samples were distributed evenly across batches at a rate of 5%. For serum, coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated for 1,464 measured metabolites using 72 replicate serum samples from 2 different pooled QC samples (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 36 QC1; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 36 QC2). CVs for 1,573 urine metabolites were calculated using 144 replicate urine samples from 2 different pooled QC samples (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 72 QC1; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 72 QC2). Additionally, we included 72 duplicate samples from IDATA participants for each sample type to estimate a technical intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) as well as a six-month, temporal ICC for each metabolite [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref035" class="ref-tip"&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;]. For a given biospecimen type, the analysis was restricted to metabolites with &amp;lt;90% missingness and &amp;lt;30% CV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="section6" class="section toc-section"&gt;&lt;a id="sec008" name="sec008" class="link-target" title="Statistical analysis"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;We characterized the distribution of UPF intake by demographic factors. We compared the median dietary intake of macronutrients and micronutrients, based on ASA-24s, and median concentrations of dietary reference biomarkers according to quintiles of the dietary share of UPF using Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p2" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;For metabolomics analysis, we used averaged measures of UPF intake and metabolites to prioritize longer-term stability over short-term fluctuations in our exposures and to maintain a simple and consistent set of exposure definitions for the correlation and LASSO regression analyses [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref035" class="ref-tip"&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;]. To account for within-person variability in our analysis, mean metabolite levels per individual, from samples collected 6 months apart, were calculated for a given metabolite and sample type and were then log-transformed using the natural logarithm. We conducted a partial Spearman’s rank correlation test to identify serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine metabolites correlated with percentage of total energy from UPF. This analysis included 952 serum metabolites, and 1,044 and 1,043 from 24-h and FMV urine metabolites, respectively. Partial correlations were adjusted for age (years), sex, race (White, non-Hispanic; African American; Asian; Hispanic), BMI category (18.5 to &amp;lt;25, 25 to &amp;lt;30, 30 to &amp;lt;40, and ≥40 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and smoking status (serum cotinine detected: yes, no). To account for multiple testing in the metabolomics analyses, we applied a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini–Hochberg method [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref036" class="ref-tip"&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;] such that a two-sided &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value of &amp;lt;0.01 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p3" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate associations between UPF intake and metabolic pathways, we used Fisher’s method [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref037" class="ref-tip"&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;] to combine &lt;em&gt;p-&lt;/em&gt;values from partial Spearman’s rank correlation tests across Metabolon assigned super- and sub-pathways. This method relies on a null distribution created from pseudo replicates, which are derived from a correlation matrix of the metabolites. The null distribution allows us to determine the significance of the combined test statistics. FDR correction was based on the number of pathways considered, and combined two-sided &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value threshold of &amp;lt;0.01 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p4" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build a poly-metabolite score predictive of UPF intake (continuous, % energy) using natural log-transformed metabolite data for serum, 24-h urine, or FMV urine, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref038" class="ref-tip"&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;], applying 10-fold cross-validation to select the optimal &lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt; value. To ensure the robustness of our model and prevent overfitting, we divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Using the training dataset, we performed LASSO regression to select metabolites. The prediction performance of the selected metabolites was then evaluated using the testing dataset with metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;-squared. Furthermore, we assessed the selection consistency of the metabolites. We applied LASSO on randomly selected 80% subsets of the dataset, repeating this procedure 100 times. The frequency of selection for each metabolite was recorded across the 100 iterations. Finally, we repeated the steps for building a poly-metabolite after dichotomizing the UPF outcome: we coded &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; = 1 for subjects with UPF above the third quartile (i.e., &amp;gt;58.2% energy intake from UPF) and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; = 0 (i.e., ≤ 58.2% energy intake from UPF) for those below. Using this binary outcome, we re-ran the LASSO model and derived predicted scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="section7" class="section toc-section"&gt;&lt;a id="sec009" name="sec009" class="link-target" title="Poly-metabolite score validation in randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Poly-metabolite score validation in randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;post-hoc&lt;/em&gt; analysis, we calculated UPF poly-metabolite scores, for EDTA plasma, 24-h urine, and spot urine metabolomics data that was previously generated in a randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03407053; IRB of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases approval number 18-DK-0044) [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref024" class="ref-tip"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;], as a linear combination of LASSO selected metabolite measures, weighted by corresponding regression coefficients from the LASSO regression models for serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine in IDATA, respectively. The feeding trial has been detailed elsewhere. In brief, 20 healthy participants (mean ± standard deviation: age 31 ± 7 years, body mass index [kg/m²] 22 ± 11.6) were domiciled at the NIH Clinical Center and consumed a diet high in UPF (80% energy from UPF) and an unprocessed diet (0% energy from UPF) &lt;em&gt;ad libitum&lt;/em&gt; for two weeks each. Metabolite levels were analyzed in EDTA plasma, 24-h, and spot urine samples collected at week 2 (i.e., post-intervention) using the same Metabolon UPLC/MS-MS platform [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref024" class="ref-tip"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;] that was used to generate metabolomics data in the IDATA Study. We tested for within individual differences in the poly-metabolite score by trial phase (80% and 0% energy from UPF) using two-sided paired &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;-tests [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref039" class="ref-tip"&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;]. For the poly-metabolite scores derived using the binary UPF outcome, we ran Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves in training and testing sets to estimate prediction performance using the Area Under the Curve (AUC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p2" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;We further considered the poly-metabolite score in a subset of 4 individuals who also participated in a second randomized, crossover-feeding trial, conducted by the same study team, where the participants consumed diets with 30% of energy from UPF, with a varying percentage of calories coming from carbohydrates and fats during each 2-week phase of the 4-week randomized, crossover trial [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref040" class="ref-tip"&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;]. An ANOVA test was conducted to compare the mean poly-metabolite scores across the three diets. Additionally, two-sided paired &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;-tests were performed to compare the mean poly-metabolite scores between diets with 0% and 30% UPF, as well as between 30% and 80% UPF. The trial metabolomics data is available under the study identifier REQ20250409209843 on MetaboLights (&lt;a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/"&gt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our analytic sample, 54% of IDATA participants were between the ages of 60 and 69 years, 51% were female, and 93% self-reported their race/ethnicity as white/non-Hispanic. There was a range of BMI, with 27%, 43% and 30% of individuals classified as normal weight (18.5 to &amp;lt;25 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), overweight (25 to &amp;lt;30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and obese (&amp;gt;30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Dietary assessment completion rates were high, with 97% of participants completing at least four ASA-24s (&lt;a href="#pmed-1004560-t001"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). Only 3 out of 718 participants completed a single ASA-24, while 76% completed all six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="link-target" id="pmed-1004560-t001" name="pmed-1004560-t001"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using repeated ASA-24s, collected over 12 months, the average percentage of daily calories from UPF was 51% in men, 49% in women, 49% in normal weight individuals, and 51% in overweight and obese individuals. We also found that 12-month average macronutrient and micronutrient intake varied substantially with UPF intake. Higher UPF intake was associated with lower average energy intake from protein as well as lower 24-h urinary nitrogen. For example, the average percentage of energy from protein in the highest compared to the lowest quintile of UPF intake was 15% and 18%, respectively. Average daily fiber density varied across quintiles of UPF intake (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value &amp;lt; 0.001), with those in the lowest quintile consuming an average of 7.9 g/1,000 kcal/day and those in the highest consuming an average of 10.7 g/1,000 kcal/day. Similarly, the average dietary intake of several micronutrients, including vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as iron, zinc, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium, varied significantly across quintiles of UPF intake (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values &amp;lt; 0.05). In contrast, individuals in the highest quintile of UPF intake tended to consume a greater percentage of energy from carbohydrates, added sugars, and saturated fat (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values &amp;lt; 0.05; &lt;a href="#pmed-1004560-t002"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

The median CV for pooled urine QC1and QC2 were 18.3% (IQR 12.3%–33.5%) and 18.5% (IQR 13.1%–32.0%), respectively. Median technical ICCs were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.93 for serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine, respectively. Six-month, temporal ICCs were slightly lower and were more variable across the metabolites; median six-month ICCs were 0.77, 0.64, and 0.50 for serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

The 155 named metabolites included lipids (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 56), amino acids (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 33), carbohydrates (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4), energy metabolites (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4), xenobiotics (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 33), cofactors and vitamins (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9), peptides (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7), nucleotides (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7), and partially characterized molecules (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2). &lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s001"&gt;S1 Fig&lt;/a&gt; illustrates the correlations between metabolites, with |&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;| ≥ 0.20 and FDR-corrected &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value &amp;lt; 0.01 for UPF intake, by biospecimen type.&lt;/p&gt;

The largest intersection in UPF intake-metabolite correlations (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 161) was for 24-h and FMV urine (&lt;a href="#pmed-1004560-t003"&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s002"&gt;S2 Fig&lt;/a&gt;). Overall, 49 UPF intake-metabolite correlations were observed in all 3 biospecimen types while 9 were common to serum and 24-h urine, and 3 were common to serum and FMV urine. Notably, 130, 74, and 24 UPF-intake-metabolite correlations were unique to serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the three biospecimen types, strong and consistent associations with UPF intake were observed for chemical compounds defined by Metabolon as xenobiotics derived from “food component/plant” and related to benzoate metabolism as well as for partially characterized molecules. Additional pathways significantly associated with UPF intake in serum and urine samples involved: amino acid metabolism (i.e., methionine, cysteine, SAM, and taurine metabolism; tyrosine metabolism; urea cycle -arginine and proline metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; glutathione metabolism; lysine metabolism; alanine and aspartate metabolism; and leucine, isoleucine, and valine metabolism), lipid metabolism (i.e., fatty acid, dicarboxylate; fatty acid, dihydroxy; phospholipid metabolism; and fatty acid metabolism (acyl carnitine, dicarboxylate)), carbohydrate metabolism (i.e., pentose metabolism; glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism), cofactor and vitamin metabolism (i.e., tocopherol metabolism; and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism), and nucleotide metabolism (i.e., uracil containing pyrimidine metabolism; and purine metabolism containing (hypo)xanthine/inosine). Energy metabolism pathways, specifically the TCA cycle, showed moderate but consistent associations across serum and urine, pointing to possible alterations in energy production processes with high UPF intake (&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s010"&gt;S5 Table&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;For poly-metabolite scores of continuous UPF intake, we selected 28, 33, and 23 metabolites for serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine, respectively, using LASSO regression (&lt;a href="#pmed-1004560-g002"&gt;Fig 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s011"&gt;S6 Table&lt;/a&gt;). RMSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values were similar in testing and training datasets, for each biospecimen type, suggesting that the prediction models were not overfit and performing well; additionally, correlations between the scores and UPF intake were moderate to strong (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 0.47) [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref019" class="ref-tip"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;] in testing and training datasets for each biospecimen type (&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s012"&gt;S7 Table&lt;/a&gt;). In serum and 24-h urine analyses, three common metabolites were selected by LASSO regression ≥60 times out of 100 iterations, making them robust predictors [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref041" class="ref-tip"&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;] of UPF intake (&lt;a href="#pmed-1004560-g003"&gt;Fig 3&lt;/a&gt;). These include two amino acids (i.e., (S)C(S)S-S-Methylcysteine sulfoxide [&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.19 to −0.23] and N2,N5-diacetylornithine [&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.26 to −0.27]); one partially characterized molecule (i.e., pentoic acid [&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.28 to −0.32), and one carbohydrate (i.e., N6-carboxymethyllysine [&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.15 to 0.21]). For poly-metabolite scores of binary UPF intake, we selected 5, 12, and 9 metabolites for serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine, respectively (&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s011"&gt;S6 Table&lt;/a&gt;). The AUCs for training and test sets were 0.75 and 0.66 for serum, 0.78 and 0.72 for 24-h urine, and 0.77 and 0.68 for FMV urine, indicating that poly-metabolite scores offer moderate discrimination between those in the highest quartile and those in the lower three quartiles of intake based on the IDATA population distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Poly-metabolite score validation in randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec6.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;We applied the serum and urine poly-metabolite scores, developed in IDATA, &lt;em&gt;post-hoc&lt;/em&gt; to existing plasma and urine metabolomics data generated in an independent, randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trial. For the score calculation, 26 out of 28 IDATA-selected serum metabolites were measured in the trial in EDTA plasma as were all selected urine metabolites. We found that the blood- and urine-based poly-metabolite scores differed substantially, within individual, between the 80% and 0% energy from UPF diet phases (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value for paired &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; test &amp;lt; 0.001; &lt;a href="#pmed-1004560-g004"&gt;Fig 4&lt;/a&gt;). In contrast, some but not all of the individual metabolites included in the poly-metabolite scores differed, within individual, between diet phases, (&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s013"&gt;S8 Table&lt;/a&gt;) suggesting that the score may be better suited as a candidate biomarker of UPF intake than any one individual metabolite. In the subset of four individuals who participated in a second feeding trial of diets with 30% energy from UPF, we found that the poly-metabolite score for 24-h urine increased stepwise, within individual, with increasing energy from UPF; for EDTA plasma and spot urine, ploy-metabolite scores were similar for diets low (i.e., 0 and 30% energy) in UPF and significantly increased for diets high in (80% energy) UPF (&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s003"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.s005"&gt;S5 Figs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4" class="section toc-section"&gt;&lt;a id="sec020" name="sec020" data-toc="sec020" class="link-target" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.p1" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how metabolites are associated with UPF intake and identifying poly-metabolite scores predictive of UPF intake in free-living individuals with varying diets has the potential to complement, extend, and advance research on UPF intake and human health. In the IDATA Study, we identified metabolites significantly correlated with UPF intake using averaged, repeated measures of metabolites and dietary intake, assessed via multiple ASA-24s, in 718 generally healthy adults. Moreover, we developed blood and urine poly-metabolite scores for UPF intake, using untargeted serum, 24-h urine, and FMV urine metabolomics data and a rigorous statistical approach, including training and testing datasets, to ensure the robustness of our results. We then applied these scores to EDTA plasma, 24-h urine, and spot urine metabolomics data, respectively, that had been previously generated in an independent, randomized, controlled, crossover, feeding trial. We demonstrated the validity of these poly-metabolite scores by showing that they differed, within individual, between consumption of diets high in (80% energy) versus to void of UPF (0% energy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.p2" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we identified hundreds of metabolites in serum (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 191) and urine (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 293 in 24-h urine and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 237 in FMV) that were significantly correlated with UPF intake. These UPF-correlated metabolites are involved in numerous and diverse biological pathways, underscoring the complex impact of diet on the metabolome. For instance, among the metabolites that were positively correlated with UPF intake, there were acylcarnitine derivatives, such as 9-decenoylcarnitine, and sphingolipids, such as the ceramides d18:1/18:0 and d18:1/20:0. Higher serum levels of acylcarnitine have been found in people who consume meat compared to vegetarians [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref022" class="ref-tip"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref042" class="ref-tip"&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref043" class="ref-tip"&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;]. In contrast, lower levels of the ceramides, d18:1/18:0 and d18:1/20:0, have been associated with better adherence to healthy dietary patterns [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref044" class="ref-tip"&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;]. An even larger number of metabolites were negatively correlated with UPF intake, including β-cryptoxanthin, which has been identified as a candidate biomarker of fruit and vegetable consumption [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref022" class="ref-tip"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref045" class="ref-tip"&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.p3" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using LASSO regression models, we identified a set of circulating and urinary metabolites that may serve collectively as predictive biomarkers for UPF intake. In total, we selected 28 serum, 33 24-h urine, and 23 FMV urine metabolites as predictors of UPF intake. Of these metabolites, three were robust (selected ≥60 times out of 100 iterations) biomarkers and were common to both serum and 24-h urine including two amino acids (i.e., (S)C(S)S-S-Methylcysteine sulfoxide and N2,N5-diacetylornithine) which were both negatively correlated with UPF intake, and a carbohydrate (i.e., N6-carboxymethyllysine), which was positively correlated with UPF intake. (S)C(S)S-S-Methylcysteine sulfoxide has been identified as a biomarker of cruciferous vegetable intake [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref046" class="ref-tip"&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;] indicating that dietary patterns high in UPF intake tend to be low in cruciferous vegetable intake. Serum levels of N6-carboxymethyllysine, an advanced glycation end-product (i.e., a family of compounds that form when sugars react with proteins, lipids or nucleic acids), have been associated with diabetes incidence and severity as well as with risk of other cardiometabolic diseases [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref047" class="ref-tip"&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref049" class="ref-tip"&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;]. The positive correlation between N6-carboxymethyllysine and UPF intake in our study suggests a potential link between a dietary pattern high in UPF and type 2 diabetes risk [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref050" class="ref-tip"&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;] through this metabolite or related metabolic pathways. This aligns with a systematic umbrella review of existing meta-analyses, which reported that greater exposure to UPF is associated with a higher risk of some adverse health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref012" class="ref-tip"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]. Moreover, this suggests the utility in using nutritional metabolomics not only to improve exposure measures but also to provide novel insight into biological mechanisms underlying potential UPF-disease associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.p4" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that the metabolomic profiles we identified reflect a dietary pattern characterized not only by high UPF consumption but also by low intake of whole foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables. In the serum set, three metabolites (out of six) in the chemical class, cofactors and vitamins, were negatively correlated with UPF intake; β-cryptoxanthin and carotene diol [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref001" class="ref-tip"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] and [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref002" class="ref-tip"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] are provitamin A carotenoids found in citrus fruits and some vegetables, such as red peppers, that have been identified as candidate biomarkers of fruit and vegetable intake [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref022" class="ref-tip"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref045" class="ref-tip"&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;]. β-cryptoxanthin has also been associated with adherence to a healthy dietary pattern [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref022" class="ref-tip"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref045" class="ref-tip"&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref051" class="ref-tip"&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;]. In line with these metabolite findings, in IDATA, we observed that average daily dietary intake of key vitamins and minerals was lower among those with higher UPF intake. This observation aligns with prior research indicating an inverse association between UPF intake and diet quality among both children and adults [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref052" class="ref-tip"&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p5" name="article1.body1.sec4.p5" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urine metabolites, selected by LASSO regression models, similarly included a diverse array of compounds. Notably, the exogenously derived metabolite, levoglucosan, which was positively correlated with UPF intake in our study, is a combustion breakdown product of cellulose, which has been used as a biopolymer in food packaging [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref053" class="ref-tip"&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;], and is excreted unmetabolized in urine after exposure [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref054" class="ref-tip"&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;]. This finding suggests that higher intake of UPF may expose individuals to food contact substances, including some from packaging materials. It is, however, important to note that this dimension of UPF exposure was reflected in urinary and not circulating metabolites. This is an important consideration for future researchers and highlights the need for dietary biomarker discovery not only in blood but also in urine and stool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p6" name="article1.body1.sec4.p6" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urine metabolites that were selected by LASSO regression were similar to those selected for 24-h urine but more limited in number. Overall, 212 UPF-metabolite correlations, which were generally similar in both magnitude and direction, were observed in both urine types demonstrating that FMV metabolite-UPF correlations are reflective of those for 24-h urine. This is important since 24-h collections are not feasible in most large epidemiological studies. We also show that while there is some overlap between blood and urine for UPF-metabolite correlates and related scores, most are unique to either blood or urine. Distinct metabolites and metabolomic profiles by biospecimen type may also translate to differences in mechanistic insight into potential UPF-health associations in etiologic studies. Our IDATA findings are consistent with a recent short-term randomized, controlled, crossover, domiciled feeding trial [&lt;a href="#pmed.1004560.ref024" class="ref-tip"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;], which found that hundreds of circulating (257 out of 993) and urine metabolites (606 out of 1,279) differed within individuals between dietary patterns containing 80% UPF and 0% UPF in post-intervention samples. We found that a majority of the metabolites identified as potential candidate biomarker in the feeding trial (i.e., 195 out of 257 circulating metabolites and 334 out of 606 urine metabolites) were also detected in IDATA samples. Of the 59 serum and 126 urine metabolites that were statistically significant in the IDATA, 85% and 79% were associated with UPF intake in the same direction (S9-S10 Tables). Three metabolites (i.e., N6-carboxymethyllysine, (S)C(S)S-S-Methylcysteine sulfoxide, and pentoic acid) that were selected as robust predictors of UPF intake in both serum and urine were among those reported in the feeding trial. When we tested our IDATA-derived poly-metabolite scores for UPF intake in this same feeding trial, we found that they differed between dietary patterns containing 80% UPF versus 0% UPF, within individual, indicating that our novel poly-metabolite scores could be used as an objective and complementary measure of UPF intake in future epidemiological investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p7" name="article1.body1.sec4.p7" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study has notable strengths, which contribute to its scientific rigor. Firstly, diet over 12 months was assessed via multiple validated 24-h dietary recalls, with more than 97% of participants completing four or more. This helped minimize measurement error due to random within-person day-to-day variation in dietary intake, and it also allowed for more accurate and detailed dietary data collection than a food frequency questionnaire. While alternative statistical methods could account for within-subject variability differently, our primary goal was biomarker selection rather than modeling longitudinal dietary intake trends. To our knowledge, there are no readily available statistical tools that integrate variable selection with repeatedly measured exposures and outcomes in a high-dimensional metabolomics setting. Given this limitation, we adopted an averaging approach, which provides a practical and interpretable solution for identifying robust biomarker signatures associated with average dietary intake. Secondly, we measured more than a thousand metabolites, related to wide range of metabolic pathways, in serial serum and urine samples collected from the same individuals 6-months apart. Serial metabolite measurements again helped to minimize measurement error owing to within-person variability in metabolite measures over time. Thirdly, we not only successfully replicated many of the associations between UPF and metabolites identified in a prior feeding trial but also demonstrated that our poly-metabolite scores effectively differentiate, within individuals, between diets high in UPF and void of UPF in that same trial. While our IDATA Study population lacked diversity, the participants consumed a range of diets, and diets high in UPF were not the same, suggesting our findings may be generalizable to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p8" name="article1.body1.sec4.p8" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study is not without limitations. For example, in the IDATA Study dietary recalls could not be reliably matched with specific biospecimen measurements as recalls were, by design, unannounced. Future studies, including feeding trials, with precise pairing of dietary intake and biospecimen collection are needed to better capture temporal dynamics. Despite the small sample size of the randomized, controlled, cross-over feeding trial, which may have contributed to the observed variation in our results, we internally validated the poly-metabolite score within the IDATA Study using LASSO regression with repeated training and testing splits. This approach ensured that our biomarker selection was not overly reliant on a single dataset and remained robust across different subsamples. While our findings lay an important foundation for exploring the potential of multi-metabolite profiles as objective markers of UPF intake, they will likely need to be iteratively improved with expanding datasets similar to polygenic risk scores. Furthermore, there is no universally accepted threshold for defining a diet high in UPF; thus, our ROC Curve analysis, which demonstrated moderate discrimination between those above and below the 75th percentile of intake, is population specific and may not be directly comparable to studies using alternative definitions or to populations with varying distributions of UPF intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id="article1.body1.sec4.p9" name="article1.body1.sec4.p9" class="link-target"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, we show that dietary patterns with higher UPF intake are associated with distinctive metabolomic profiles in both serum and urine. Future studies are needed to validate our UPF poly-metabolite scores in more diverse populations with varying diets and to explore whether integrating poly-metabolite scores with self-reported dietary data can reduce measurement error and improve risk prediction. Finally, research on the prospective association between UPF-correlated metabolites, poly-metabolite scores, and disease risk is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple testing was corrected for using the Benjamini–Hochberg method; statistical significance was defined as a corrected &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value of &amp;lt;0.01. Correlations between metabolites with |&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;| ≥ 0.20 and FDR-corrected &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value &amp;lt;0.01 are visualized in the heatmap. The dark purple color shows strong negative metabolite-metabolite correlations and the dark red color shows strong positive metabolite-metabolite correlations. The dendrogram uses hierarchical clustering and shows that metabolites generally cluster according to the direction of their correlation with UPF intake.
