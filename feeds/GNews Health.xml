It is not the first to link gestational diabetes to neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but it is one of the largest. Researchers pooled results from 48 studies across 20 countries, finding that children born to people with gestational diabetes had lower IQ scores, a 36% higher risk of ADHD and a 56% higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. Estimates suggest the prevalence of autism in the general population is one in 127 people&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and between 3-10%&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of children and teenagers have ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results mirror those of another meta-analysis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/i&gt; journal in June, which included 56 million mother–child pairs and found that all types of diabetes in pregnancy, including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, increase the risk of the baby developing ADHD and autism. But none of these studies have been able to show that diabetes during pregnancy causes these conditions. “There’s no doubt that there is a signal here, but certainly further research is required,” says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long a topic of research, the causes of autism have been thrust into the spotlight by the administration of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1#ref-CR4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;US President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. On Sunday, while speaking at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump said: “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that?” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Trump’s administration is poised to announce a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol, during pregnancy. &lt;a href="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/f4cd8a064d47b62a-0e01df33044e-139fddfcb7c79fd0c38a7065fad62081b237334047fed3a63e4463e31f34.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/f4cd8a064d47b62a-0e01df33044e-139fddfcb7c79fd0c38a7065fad62081b237334047fed3a63e4463e31f34.pdf" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Medical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; say acetominophen is safe to use during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, genetics has the strongest influence on the risk of developing ADHD and autism. Environmental factors, such as folic-acid deficiency, air pollution and gestational diabetes, have a small-to-moderate effect on the risk of these conditions, says Ling-Jun Li, a clinician–scientist at the National University of Singapore and a co-author on the latest gestational diabetes study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyakov agrees: “In practice, both genetic predisposition and environmental factors likely interact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health impacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies over the past two decades&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have shown that gestational diabetes has long-term effects on women’s health, such as increasing their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li and her colleagues decided to review the evidence for effects of the condition on neurocognitive development in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CITYWIDE — Local health officials are urging Chicagoans to get vaccinated against mpox amid a spike in cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been 81 new cases of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, reported in Chicago over the past six months — and 90 percent of them have been diagnosed since June 10, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health. Fourteen new cases were reported Sept. 9-15 alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mpox has particularly affected gay, bisexual and same-gender-loving men in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Crone, infectious disease specialist physician at Howard Brown, said his organization’s clinic has seen the increase — and vaccination remains key to reducing the severity of illness.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“While we can and have seen cases in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, vaccination can still provide good protection and minimize the severity of the symptoms experienced if a person is infected,” Crone said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can range from mild to severe, including bumps or sores and significant anal pain. Anyone with symptoms should get tested and isolated until they receive a diagnosis, Crone said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-CALOR-Monkeypox-Vaccines-Colin-Boyle-7949.jpg?resize=1650%2C1098&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-560953"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Community health RN Margaret Mary Butler fills a syringe with the smallpox and mypox vaccine during a vaccination clinic at CALOR in Humboldt Park on Aug. 17, 2022. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment is largely supportive care and pain management until the infection resolves. Health officials are also reminding people who only received one dose of the two-dose vaccine series to complete the series for stronger protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To combat the surge, the health department is making mpox vaccination the centerpiece of clinics this fall where people can also get flu and COVID shots. The mpox vaccine is also available at the city’s &lt;a href="https://click.citynews.chicago.gov/?qs=443e6e23c13479462e224b1cff570fae5e72a539c6d6c663ce0e21c0c2fe9157126b2f9ee77898e501bae6b25af866aa59e3620ec458eb65" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sexual Health Clinics&lt;/a&gt; in Lakeview, Austin and Roseland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While anyone can get mpox, this summer’s increase has disproportionately affected sexually active gay, bisexual, and same-gender-loving men,” health department officials said in a press release. “Adding the mpox vaccine to your fall health routine is the best way to protect yourself and your community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-mpox-spread"&gt;How Does Mpox Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mpox spreads through:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct contact with a person’s infectious rash, scabs or body fluids.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling or sex.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Touching items — like clothing or bedding — that have previously touched a person’s infectious rash or body fluids.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;From an infected pregnant person to a fetus.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Infected animals scratching, biting or being consumed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People can spread the virus from the time they show symptoms until their rash has fully healed. Those without symptoms cannot spread mpox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symptoms-of-mpox"&gt;Symptoms Of Mpox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most notable symptom is a rash that can resemble pimples or blisters, appearing on the face, hands, chest, genitals or anus. The rash can also develop internally, making it painful to eat, drink or use the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other common symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Muscle and back aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Swollen lymph nodes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rash can be “excruciatingly painful,” health experts have warned. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care and testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-CALOR-Monkeypox-Vaccines-Colin-Boyle-7788.jpg?resize=1650%2C1098&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-560934"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Community health RN Kristen Figueroa administers the smallpox and mpox vaccine to a patient during a vaccination clinic at CALOR in Humboldt Park on Aug. 17, 2022. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-do-if-you-think-you-have-mpox"&gt;What To Do If You Think You Have Mpox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolate from others and avoid skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not share bedding, towels or other linens.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid sex or intimacy until evaluated by a medical professional.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Contact a health provider or call the health department at 312-746-4835 to get connected to testing and care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-get-vaccinated-in-chicago"&gt;Who Can Get Vaccinated In Chicago&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are available to anyone in Illinois who fits any of these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has had skin-to-skin contact with someone diagnosed with mpox.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People who exchange sex for goods or services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People living with HIV, particularly those not in regular care.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People taking or eligible for PrEP.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexually active gay, bisexual and same-gender-loving men.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexually active transgender people.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexual partners of the above groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-to-get-vaccinated"&gt;Where To Get Vaccinated&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Department of Public Health has a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/infectious_disease/supp_info/mpox-home/mpox-vaccine.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;map of clinics where people can be vaccinated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Howard Brown Health’s clinics also offer vaccines by appointment or walk in. &lt;a href="https://howardbrown.org/locations/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Find a location nearest you here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kimchi&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimchi, fermented cabbage, is one of Gans’ top foods for improving gut health. “Fermentation results in postbiotics, non-living metabolites that provide a health benefit when consumed,” Gans said. “Research on postbiotics has shown they help balance the microbiome in our gut and maintain digestive health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Ginger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some may complain of bloating after consuming ginger, according to Dr. Bedford, it tends to be a great food for regulating gut health (and adding some flavor to your dishes). “It cuts down on gut inflammation and fermentation, it helps in terms of bowel habit or bowel movements and contains antioxidants,” Dr. Bedford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Black beans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have heard that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25922606/high-fiber-low-carb-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber foods;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt; are good for your health—this is also true for your gut. “Black beans are packed with fiber, both insoluble and soluble,” said Gans. “Insoluble fiber specifically has been associated with decreasing the risk of constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Almonds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds are high in healthy fats, fiber, and protein and are a great nut option for supporting your overall health. These nuts “help to support the gut microbiome,” Dr. Bedford said, and are “definitely good for gut health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gans recommended adding yogurt to your diet as it is a great option for a probiotic-rich food. “Probiotics consist of living microorganisms that help increase the good bacteria in our gut,” Gans explained. Plus, yogurt can easily be eaten as a tasty snack or added to foods like smoothies, soups, condiments, baked goods, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Bananas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to add more fruits to your diet, Dr. Bedford recommended eating more bananas. They are high in fiber, which aids in digestion and helps you feel full for longer. Bananas also contain prebiotics, which help the good bacteria in your gut (also known as probiotics) thrive, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/author/218096/natalie-rizzo-m-s-r-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natalie Rizzo, M.S., R.D.;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natalie Rizzo, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, previously explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phrase “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” may actually have some merit. Along with bananas, apples are “definitely a good fruit for gut health,” Dr. Bedford noted, thanks to the fiber and prebiotics they contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Pears&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pears are another great fruit to add to your menu because they are also “a good source of fiber, specifically soluble fiber,” Gans explained. “Soluble fiber helps promote regular bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Asparagus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Asparagus is a prebiotic food that is good for your gut,” Gans explained. “Prebiotics are food for the good bacteria in your gut, helping them flourish and keeping a healthy balance of the microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Kale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like asparagus, kale is a green leafy vegetable, which is a variety that Dr. Bedford said is “full of various vitamins and antioxidants that are certainly important to not only gut health, but also your overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Collard greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for more leafy greens to add to your plate, look no further than &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a34212046/collard-greens-nutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:collard greens;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;collard greens&lt;/a&gt;. This vegetable is high in (you guessed it) fiber and has a high water content, which aids in digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Salmon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seafood lovers, rejoice. “Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce any potential inflammation in the gut,” Gans explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onions are another great prebiotic-rich food that help contribute to better gut health, according to Dr. Bedford. Plus, onions are great for adding lots of flavor to a variety of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;14. Sauerkraut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever topped your hot dog with sauerkraut, you’ve been doing your gut a favor. This fermented cabbage product is a probiotic-rich food that makes for a tasty side or condiment while also protecting your gut, according to research from the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/news/gut-health-benefits-sauerkraut" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of California, Davis;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of California, Davis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;15. Kefir&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of kefir as yogurt’s more fermented (derived from milk) sibling. Dr. Bedford recommended this probiotic powerhouse as it aids in digestive and immune health. “Anything that is fermented is essentially a good, probiotic-friendly food,” Dr. Bedford explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are probiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are “living microorganisms,” said Gans. These microorganisms are bacteria—commonly referred to as “good” bacteria. These good bacteria can be found in lots of foods (as well as &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g33704757/best-probiotic-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:probiotic supplements;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt;) and help contribute to a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut and the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are prebiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60990121/probiotics-and-prebiotics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prebiotics and probiotics;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; are actually very different—but we depend on both for optimal gut health. While probiotics, like yogurt, are foods fortified with good gut microflora, prebiotics are the foods that have the nutrients to feed that gut microflora, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suneerjain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sunny Jain;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sunny Jain&lt;/a&gt;, molecular biologist and Sun Genomics founder &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a41506061/best-prebiotic-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previously explained;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previously explained&lt;/a&gt;. “A prebiotic food’s purpose is not to provide nutrition to you and your physiology, but to your commensal gut microbes and their micro-physiology, broadly called gut health,” Jain added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 11:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQU2VmNGNvWHQ2cUVmQVBCamJLOWhUbGhXVFhXVmNuWFlVRzJ0UnV5b3RGb0ROYmxvVFhLQU04Q2JxTk15aE9LVGhFSW9zSjNERFhlX2RrVWY4ZTMxMXk0VW84ZTZVdVhiQ0VsMk1CSUxYOTFWT2NPeHBUYWQ4b3pHRzBWTC1zOGJx</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，这些“健康”食品对您的长寿没有任何好处- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-foods-that-dont-help-you-live-longer_l_68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While no one can control how long they’ll live completely, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-foods-to-eat-for-a-long-life-according-to-longevity-experts-goog_l_67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="what you eat " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;what you eat &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;plays a pretty significant role.

It’s true. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35914402/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Scientific research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35914402/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that eating a plant-based diet consisting largely of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and just a small amount of meat is associated with better health and lower mortality. But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://longevitylab.clinic/practitioners/dietitian/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Maria Kupreeva, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://longevitylab.clinic/practitioners/dietitian/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maria Kupreeva, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a registered dietitian with integrative health clinic The Longevity Lab, shared that relying too heavily on overly processed meat alternatives can backfire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Meat alternative products can be helpful for people who want to avoid meat for ethical or other reasons. They still provide protein and some other nutrients. But a lot of highly processed alternative meat products are high in sodium and have a lot of filler ingredients,” Kupreeva shared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9832237/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="High-sodium foods" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9832237/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;High-sodium foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and other life-threatening conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When possible, Kupreeva recommends going for plant-based foods like beans, lentils, chickpeas and tofu over ultra-processed meat alternatives. When you do buy them, her advice is to check out the ingredients list (shorter with whole food plant sources is best) and nutritional panel, making sure the sodium isn’t too high.

Instant oatmeal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s hard to think of a breakfast that sounds healthier than oatmeal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oats are great because they’re high in fiber and have lots of B vitamins,” Kupreeva said.

Unfortunately, Kupreeva told HuffPost that instant oatmeal is often high in added sugar. And &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11287388/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="added sugar is a life shortener" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11287388/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;added sugar is a life shortener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, not a life lengthener. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few reasons why consuming too much sugar can take years off your life. Gidwani explained that sugary foods (like flavored instant oatmeal) spike blood sugar levels. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6205735/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Scientific studies show" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6205735/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Scientific studies show&lt;/a&gt; that when blood sugar levels are unstable and fluctuate regularly, it decreases lifespan. This is because unstable blood sugars increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease — all of which can shorten lifespan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To keep your oatmeal as healthy as possible, go for rolled oats and sweeten it with berries, a naturally sweet fruit that has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38184200/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="scientifically shown to support longevity" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38184200/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;scientifically shown to support longevity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Fruit juice &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has fruit in the name, so it must be healthy, right? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://supp.co/u/darshan-shah" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Darshan Shah" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://supp.co/u/darshan-shah" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Darshan Shah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a board-certified surgeon, founder of national longevity clinic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.next-health.com/team/dr-darshan-shah" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Next Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.next-health.com/team/dr-darshan-shah" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and expert advisor at SuppCo, shared that fruit juice doesn’t deserve its health halo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fruit juice is high in sugar and low in fiber,” he said. Kupreeva said this too, explaining that fruit juices don’t have the fiber and other nutrients whole fruit do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead of drinking fruit juice, Kupreeva recommends eating whole fruit or sipping a smoothie, which still has all of the fiber and nutrients without any of the added sugar fruit juices often have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Acai bowls &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colorful fruit-topped acai bowls sure look healthy, but according to Gidwani, they are often full of added sugar and artificial ingredients. She explained that there’s a major nutritional difference between acai bowls made with berries and honey versus ones that are made with fruit juice which, as previously mentioned, are often high in added sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Yuliya Furman / 500px via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yuliya Furman / 500px via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Colorful fruit-topped acai bowls sure look healthy, but they are often full of added sugar and artificial ingredients.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re buying your acai bowl in the freezer section at the grocery store, Gidwani recommends reading the ingredients list and nutritional panel to check for added sugar. It will contain total sugar because of the fruit, which is fine, but if it’s high in added sugar, she recommends skipping it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Protein powders and bars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No nutrient gets more attention than protein and while it’s important, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eating-enough-protein_l_6895f260e4b001d68aee01fd" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="most people are getting enough" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6895f260e4b001d68aee01fd" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;most people are getting enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Not only do you likely not need protein powders and bars, but the experts we talked to said that most of them do nothing in terms of longevity. “Protein powders, while convenient, don’t provide the same benefits as whole-food protein sources,” Shah said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gidwani added to this, saying that protein bars can be helpful if you’re on-the-go and don’t have access to whole food ingredients. But she said that many are made with added sugar and other additives that aren’t good for health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gidwani pointed out that the benefit of consuming protein-rich foods like eggs, edamame, chickpeas or tofu is that these foods have other nutrients in addition to protein. But all a protein powder is going to bring to the table is that one singular nutrient. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Egg whites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you’re at brunch and you hear someone order an egg white omelette, it can sound healthier than the scrambled eggs you’re considering. Don’t be fooled: It isn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Egg whites are overrated. While egg whites do have protein, there are a lot of nutrients in the egg yolk, too,” Gidwani said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

While in its early stages, the disease is often confined to the gland itself, advanced prostate cancer may spread to distant parts of the body such as the bones, lymph nodes, and, in rarer cases, the skin. When cancer cells reach the skin, this is known as cutaneous metastasis. These skin changes can sometimes resemble ordinary dermatological conditions, making them difficult to recognise. Identifying such symptoms early is vital, as it supports timely diagnosis, guides effective management, highlights disease progression, and aids in monitoring treatment response and overall patient prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding cutaneous metastasis in prostate cancer: Spread of cancer cells to the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous metastasis refers to the spread of cancer cells to the skin from a primary tumour located elsewhere in the body. In prostate cancer, this occurrence is uncommon but significant. A study published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijd/fulltext/2024/03000/beyond_the_usual_suspects__when_the_skin_tells_a.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Indian Journal of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; indicates that skin metastases from prostate cancer are rare, with an incidence of approximately 0.36%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These skin lesions often appear in the later stages of prostate cancer and can serve as an indicator of advanced disease. The presence of skin metastases is associated with a poor prognosis, with average survival times of less than six months following the appearance of these lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Common skin symptoms associated with prostate cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nodules and papules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequent skin manifestations of prostate cancer metastasis are hard nodules or papules. These lesions are typically firm to the touch, raised above the skin’s surface, and may vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are usually skin-coloured to reddish-brown and can sometimes mimic benign skin growths such as cysts or lipomas, which makes diagnosis challenging. Nodules most often appear on the chest, abdomen, and extremities, though they can occasionally develop near the genital area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Zosteriform distribution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, cutaneous metastases may present in what is called a zosteriform distribution. This refers to skin lesions that appear in a band-like arrangement along a dermatome – the area of skin supplied by sensory nerves from a single spinal root. These lesions may be misdiagnosed as shingles (herpes zoster) due to their similar appearance and distribution. Unlike shingles, however, zosteriform metastases are usually not painful or associated with blistering. They may appear as clustered papules or plaques and can progress over time, becoming firmer and more extensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sclerodermoid lesions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another uncommon but significant skin manifestation of prostate cancer metastasis is sclerodermoid lesions. These present as hard, thickened, and sometimes shiny patches of skin that closely resemble scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that causes fibrosis and tightening of the skin. According to a study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ijdvl.com/cutaneous-metastasis-of-an-advanced-prostate-cancer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venerology, and Leprology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the affected skin may feel bound down to the underlying tissue, limiting mobility and flexibility in the area. Such lesions are often mistaken for dermatological conditions such as morphea or lichen sclerosus, delaying the correct diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Ulcerated lesions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although less common, ulcerated lesions may develop as a result of cutaneous prostate cancer metastases. These lesions occur when the cancerous nodules break through the skin’s surface, leaving open, raw sores that may ooze fluid or bleed. Ulcerated lesions are typically painful and difficult to manage, as they are prone to bacterial infections and have a slow-healing process. Their appearance usually signifies advanced or terminal disease, and they can severely impact a patient’s comfort and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diagnosis and differentiation from other skin conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903053/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; PMC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows that diagnosing cutaneous metastasis from prostate cancer requires a thorough clinical evaluation and histopathological examination.

Kennedy Jr. is attacking the hepatitis B vaccine, look to the rhetoric coming from his loudest fans in the anti-vaccine movement. According to the misnamed Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, the only women who get hepatitis B are filthy degenerates. Jillian Michaels, the former reality TV star-turned right-wing demagogue, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jE5yx6LoiY"&gt;declared last year&lt;/a&gt; that the hepatitis B vaccine is only useful for “drug addicts and people who have risky sex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we protecting them for a lifetime of unprotected sex and drugs?” a popular MAHA advocate &lt;a href="https://x.com/VigilantFox/status/1968655869312147583"&gt;complained on X&lt;/a&gt;, apparently thinking it’s self-evident that that such protection is unnecessary for good people. A favorite anti-vaccine podcaster &lt;a href="https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1968686756309385548"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that hepatitis B is a disease of people who have “anal sex” and who get “stuck with a needle full of blood of an infected person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across X, so-called “MAHA moms” have &lt;a href="https://x.com/JenniferMarguli/status/1353081670442774528"&gt;made it clear&lt;/a&gt; that they feel insulted by &lt;a href="https://x.com/millerkim34/status/1968352363040927843"&gt;the pre-Kennedy recommendation that newborns&lt;/a&gt; get vaccinated for hepatitis B, as if the doctor is implying that, as mothers, they are among the “bad” women who do drugs or have what they consider the wrong kind of sex. This is why &lt;span&gt;Susan Monarez, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/watch-susan-monarez-fired-cdc-chief-senate-hearing-rfk-jr-vaccines-hepatitis-b/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; during her Senate testimony last week that Kennedy was ignoring scientific evidence to attack vaccine access, including a hepatitis B vaccine administered to newborns. On Friday, under fire from medical experts and several Republicans, Kennedy’s hand-picked CDC vaccine panel &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html"&gt;postponed a vote&lt;/a&gt; on whether to delay the newborn immunizations. But with the secretary’s army of MAHA moms insisting the vaccine is an attack on their purity, the threat of a policy change is not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="youtube-classic-embed"&gt;&lt;span class="w-full flex justify-center !m-0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral dictates, of course, don’t protect infants from hepatitis B. As pediatrician Dr. Paul Offit &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/opinion/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk.html"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; last week, unvaccinated babies can get the virus — even if their mothers aren’t infected — “from relatively casual contact with people who had chronic hepatitis B.” Unlike adults, “you’re especially vulnerable as an infant,” he said. But don’t expect MAHA moms to accept that reality. Their draconian rules for what makes a “good” mother are such that they’d still blame women if babies got infected, because proper mothers heavily police their child’s contact with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy and the MAHA movement’s obsession with shaming women was on full display with the Washington Post’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that HHS is set to tie autism risk to women who use Tylenol during pregnancy. As with most claims coming from Kennedy’s disinformation-happy machine, this finding is &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/research-doesnt-show-using-tylenol-during-pregnancy-causes-autism-here-are-5-things-to-know"&gt;false&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s easy to see how the idea fits neatly into the right’s sexist vision of motherhood as a state of endless self-sacrifice. Tylenol is already discouraged for treating minor aches and pains during pregnancy. The medical consensus is that it should only be used to battle high fevers that can be dangerous for both the mother and the developing fetus. But the vision of a woman enduring misery to “protect” her baby is romanticized by the right — even if the suffering would, in this case, only risk the health of the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5534412/rfk-maha-report-childrens-health"&gt;newly released report&lt;/a&gt; from the so-called MAHA Commission also underscores how Kennedy and his allies are hyper-focused on shaming women, even if it comes at the expense of harming children. Even though it was advertised as the “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html"&gt;Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy&lt;/a&gt;,” the report includes almost no substantive proposals for government action to improve child health. Instead, it shifts even more responsibility for child health outcomes onto the parents. Most of the strategy is about “educating” parents about what Kennedy believes is proper child-rearing, including his esoteric and false ideas about nutrition. (The secretary, for instance, thinks eating a diet high in animal fat is good, contrary to the wide consensus of medical experts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on the issue of environmental pollution, which Kennedy claims to care about, the onus is on parents, not on government regulators. The report recommends that HHS “inform the public, especially parents and caregivers, about how environmental factors can affect children’s health outcomes.” In other words, if you live in a high-pollution area, it’s on you to move. If you can’t afford it, it’s your fault for being poor. The polluting companies, and the government that is supposed to regulate them, are blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the biggest government initiative proposed in the document is deregulating food safety standards, which would make it easier for shady operations to sell goods at farmers markets. A lot of MAHA types argue that food regulation should be left to individual consumers to investigate every purchase individually and determine if it feels safe to them. Casey Means, a “wellness” influencer President Donald Trump nominated to be surgeon general on Kennedy’s recommendation, has rejected pasteurization requirements. Instead, she has &lt;a href="https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/newsletter-38"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that women should “form a relationship with a local farmer, understand his integrity, look him in the eyes, pet his cow, and then decide” if the milk is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this recommendation is profoundly stupid. One cannot tell if a cow’s milk is safe by petting the animal. But what Means recommends would require a time commitment that is not feasible for most people, especially busy mothers. With the deregulation of food safety being pushed by the Trump administration, the process of “researching” your own food would reach far beyond just milk. Even if driving to the farm and buying everything directly were a way to verify food safety — and it’s not — it’s ridiculous to expect modern people to forgo the basic convenience of the grocery store. This would also mean having to cook way more from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations like these may not seem overtly sexist. But with the larger MAGA movement pushing traditional gender roles, there can be little doubt that women will be the ones expected to handle the new influx of responsibilities pushed on them by the MAHA culture. It’s women who would be expected to give up pouring a child a bowl of cereal in favor of making bread from scratch. It’s women who would be tasked with staying home with kids who have measles. And if those children were to die, women would be blamed for supposedly not feeding them enough homegrown organic foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement’s &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paleofuture.bsky.social/post/3lygp3go3js2s"&gt;preoccupation with shaming women&lt;/a&gt; is evident in the fertility section of the MAHA strategy document. A call to “address the root causes of infertility” sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this phrase is MAHA code for shaming women who use birth control. As I &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/08/08/trumps-drops-ivf-promise-preferring-to-blame-women-for-infertility/"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, various MAHA groups have become fixated on the lie that the birth control pill is the cause of infertility. Means has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcyxb7asLwI&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt;made the podcast rounds&lt;/a&gt;, blaming birth control for infertility. Alex Clark, who was hired by Charlie Kirk to be Turning Point USA’s “wellness” influencer, has also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/birth-control-side-effects-influencers-danger-rcna90492"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that women suffering infertility brought it on themselves by previous birth control use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all a lie — but the strategy fits into the larger moralism that fuels the MAHA movement and is centered around this notion that modern life has made women “impure” and children’s health problems are a direct result. Having sex for pleasure is the main source of this alleged “impurity,” of course, and it’s why both birth control and abortion are demonized. Vaccine opponents even &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOoqz40yGquo-vzjlemd0uHs3n_GMOQX644QoLkiNZVk_4aBz6HyT"&gt;falsely claim&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines contain the cells of aborted fetuses, an explicit reminder of their belief that children are being tainted by the wanton sexualities of modern women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/us/politics/vaccine-mandates-covid-measles.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on how the measles outbreak that killed at least two children in Texas is impacting vaccination opponents in the state. To the reporter’s apparent surprise, it turns out these people don’t appear to care if children die. They seem to view such tragedies as a price to pay to uphold a right-wing values system that is obsessed with ideas of purity and traditional gender roles. The anti-vaccine views are wrapped into larger sexist attitudes. They expect women to home school children. They create banks of breast milk from unvaccinated women and demand babysitters be unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that female bodies are made unclean by vaccines is all tied up in a larger sexist view that good women stay at home and avoid too much contact with the outside world. Republicans may have not liked the pandemic lockdowns, but when it comes to women, a version of that is being upheld as a permanent alternative to the fictional evils of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

                Lynn Milam says that a nerve-stimulating implant has dramatically improved her rheumatoid arthritis, allowing her and her husband, Donald, to regain the life they once enjoyed together.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For more than four years, Lynn Milam's life was bound by the pain that radiated from her swollen joints.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My children could not hug me," she says. "I couldn't hold my husband's hand."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Milam also couldn't climb stairs or help raise her teenage son. She spent most days on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The reason was &lt;a href="https://rheumatology.org/patients/rheumatoid-arthritis" target="_blank"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the lining of joints.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Milam tried everything: physical therapy, acupuncture, steroids and even the latest &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/rheumatoid-arthritis/ra-treatment/" target="_blank"&gt;immune drugs&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That changed in October of 2023, when a surgeon implanted an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/search/?query=rheumatoid%20arthritis&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;sortType=bestMatch" target="_blank"&gt;experimental device&lt;/a&gt; in Milam's neck. For a minute each morning, it delivers pulses of electricity to her vagus nerve, which connects the brain with internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-89656" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                This device, when attached to the vagus nerve, can dramatically reduce symptoms in patients with some of the most severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Three weeks in, my elbow pain was completely gone," she says. "Then my hands didn't hurt anymore, the swelling started going away."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eventually, all symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis had vanished. Milam, 60, says she and her husband have regained the life they enjoyed before she got sick.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It's like a rebirth," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And now, the device will be available to many other people like Milam.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In July, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://setpointmedical.com/setpoint-medical-receives-fda-approval-for-novel-neuroimmune-modulation-therapy-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/" target="_blank"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the device, made by SetPoint Medical, for people with rheumatoid arthritis whose symptoms aren't adequately controlled by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Aug. 22, surgeons at Northwell Health in New York &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/northwell-first-to-offer-setpoint-system-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-patients" target="_blank"&gt;implanted&lt;/a&gt; the first approved device in a patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-89668" class="bucketwrap image medium"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval could be a turning point for the treatment of not only rheumatoid arthritis, but other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This treatment is using the body's own mechanism of managing inflammation," says &lt;a href="https://www.azarthritis.com/aara-physicians/tesser-john/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. John Tesser&lt;/a&gt;, a rheumatologist in Phoenix who oversaw the study that led to the device's approval.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By stimulating the vagus nerve, the device sends a signal to the hypothalamus, a brain area that regulates bodily functions and interacts with the immune system. That brain area responds by sending signals back down the vagus nerve to the spleen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The signals instruct certain cells in the spleen to slow down production of proteins called cytokines, which regulate inflammation, including inflammation in the joints. Cytokines play an important role in fighting infection, but can also trigger damage to healthy tissues, including the lining of joints.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The device rarely produces the sort of dramatic recovery that Lynn Milam experienced. But the pivotal clinical trial found that patients who had not responded to even the most powerful drugs often saw meaningful improvement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Thirty-five percent of the patients did achieve that in this very difficult-to-treat group," Tesser says. That was significantly more than in a comparison group whose stimulators had not yet been switched on.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The entire process is initiated by an implant "the size of a lima bean," says &lt;a href="https://rni.wvumedicine.org/about-rni/leadership/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Peter Konrad&lt;/a&gt;, chair of neurosurgery at the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute at West Virginia University. "Everything's all built on a little chip and then it's contained in a little silicon jacket."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outpatient surgery to implant the device is straightforward for any surgeon who has implanted vagus nerve stimulators often used to control epileptic seizures, Konrad says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I've had dental surgery that was more of a process than this surgery was," Milam says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the surgery, though, there was a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because the device sits so close to the vocal cords, Milam's voice was temporarily limited to a whisper. A second procedure fixed that but left her voice slightly lower than it had been.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Milam says she'll accept that for a treatment that did what drugs couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The stimulator has restored her ability to climb stairs, cook and travel, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her husband, Donald Milam, says it's also allowing the couple to do things together again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Walking the dogs, holding hands — just the simple things," he says.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habit, not conscious choice, drives most of our actions, according to new research from the University of Surrey, University of South Carolina and Central Queensland University.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2025.2561149" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology &amp;amp; Health&lt;/i&gt;, found that two-thirds of our daily behaviors are initiated "on autopilot", out of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits are actions that we are automatically prompted to do when we encounter everyday settings, due to associations that we have learned between those settings and our usual responses to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also found that 46% of behaviors were both triggered by habit and aligned with conscious intentions, suggesting that people form habits that support their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/personal+goals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;personal goals&lt;/a&gt;, and often disrupt habits that conflict with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have been previous attempts to estimate the prevalence of habits in our day-to-day lives, this study used a new method to capture habits in action. The international research team surveyed 105 participants from the UK and Australia, sending six random prompts to their phones each day for a week, asking them to describe what they were currently doing, and whether it was triggered out of habit or done intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that 65% of daily behaviors were habitually initiated, meaning people were prompted to do them out of routine rather than making a conscious decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Benjamin Gardner, Professor of Psychology at the University of Surrey and co-author of the study, said, "Our research shows that while people may consciously want to do something, the actual initiation and performance of that behavior is often done without thinking, driven by non-conscious habits. This suggests that 'good' habits may be a powerful way to make our goals a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"For people who want to break their bad habits, simply telling them to 'try harder' isn't enough. To create lasting change, we must incorporate strategies to help people recognize and disrupt their unwanted habits, and ideally form positive new ones in their place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings may have broader implications for public health and wellness interventions. The researchers recommend that initiatives designed to help people adopt new behaviors, like exercising or eating healthier, should focus on building new, positive habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for someone trying to take up exercise, inconsistent exercising may not be enough. The most effective strategy would involve identifying an everyday situation in which exercise can realistically be done—for example, at a certain time of day, or following a regular event, like leaving work—and consistently doing some exercise in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, to break a bad habit like smoking, simply wanting to quit may not cut it. The most effective strategies would involve disrupting triggers (e.g. avoiding places where they used to smoke) and creating new routines (e.g. chewing gum after a meal instead of having a cigarette).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amanda Rebar, Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the study said, "People like to think of themselves as rational decision makers, who think carefully about what to do before they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, much of our repetitive behavior is undertaken with minimal forethought and is instead generated automatically, by habit."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Dr. Grace Vincent, Sleep Scientist and Associate Professor at Central Queensland University and co-author of the study, said the findings offer hope to people trying to develop healthier lifestyles. "Our study shows that two-thirds of what people do each day is sparked by habit, and most of the time those habits are also aligned with our intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This means that if we set out to create a positive habit, whether that's around better sleep hygiene, or nutrition, or general well-being improvements, we can rely on an internal 'autopilot' to take over and help us maintain those habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, not all habits are created equal. Exercise was the exception in our findings, as it was often triggered by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/habit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;habit&lt;/a&gt;, but less likely to be achieved purely on autopilot, compared to other behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met last week to review part of the agency’s vaccine schedule. The independent panel considered proposed changes to recommendations for the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; and COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, hundreds of laws and regulations across virtually &lt;a href="https://www.astho.org/topic/resource/impact-of-acip-recommendations-on-state-law/"&gt;every state&lt;/a&gt; and several U.S. territories have incorporated the recommendations of the panel. But Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/rfk-vaccine-advisory-panel-new-members/"&gt;overhauled&lt;/a&gt; the panel in June and stocked it with like-minded vaccine skeptics, prompting medical associations and states to begin &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/nyregion/northeast-public-health-collaborative-trump.html"&gt;unwinding&lt;/a&gt; their reliance ACIP guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thursday-Friday meeting—the second since Kennedy took the unprecedented step of firing all 17 previous ACIP members and the first since he added five additional members just days earlier—further splintered the previous consensus about who should get what vaccines, and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers, medical associations, and former public health officials had feared that the re-made committee would narrow or remove recommendations for some vaccines at the meeting last week, not on the basis of new scientific findings or data, but in furtherance of the secretary’s anti-vaccine agenda. Indeed, the recently fired CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before Congress last week that Kennedy had asked her to commit to rubber-stamping whatever the committee decided regardless of the scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the meeting were a mixed bag. ACIP tabled a planned vote to recommend delaying the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine from birth to at least 1 month of age if the mother tests negative for the disease. But the committee rescinded its recommendation for the combination MMRV vaccine for children under age 4. The recommendation for a two-shot series of a separate MMR vaccine and chickenpox (varicella) vaccine for young children remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel also revoked the recommendation encouraging routine COVID vaccination and replaced it with language recommending that individuals 6 months and older consult with health care providers, a practice known as shared clinical decision-making (&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-update-healthcare-professionals/newsletter/shared-clinical-decision-making-what-it-and-why-it-matters"&gt;SCDM&lt;/a&gt;), about COVID immunization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference? As the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.html#:~:text=The%20key%20distinction,decision%2Dmaking%20process."&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; on its site, a routine recommendation’s guidance is that “the default decision should be to vaccinate the patient based on age group or other indication, unless contraindicated. For shared clinical decision-making recommendations, there is no default.” A member of ACIP’s COVID work group &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/11-perlman-bernstein-miglis-covid-508.pdf"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting that under SCDM, “vaccination is often interpreted as optional.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel split 6-6 on a separate vote to require a prescription to get a COVID vaccine; the committee’s chair, Martin Kulldorff, broke the tie by voting no. Some members &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=22106"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; unaware of how a prescription requirement would impact vaccine access. Kulldorff also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=23189"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting that the committee doesn’t have the authority to establish a prescription requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift in recommendations stops short of removing the vaccine from the schedule entirely, and HHS has said in &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html#:~:text=Individual%20decision%2Dmaking%20is,federal%20Health%20Insurance%20Marketplace."&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that insurers would continue to cover vaccination. But in the immediate aftermath of the meeting, it is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/kennedys-vaccine-advisers-vote-to-remove-blanket-recommendation-that-older-americans-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-00573309#:~:text=The%20practical%20implications,Hard%20to%20say.%E2%80%9D"&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt; exactly how the new guidance will affect vaccine access. Multiple committee members themselves &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=21249"&gt;voiced confusion&lt;/a&gt; on what their votes actually meant for healthy people and for vulnerable populations trying to get vaccinated. How the panel’s changes affect access to vaccines will vary by location and how state laws integrate ACIP recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further complicating factor is that the Food and Drug Administration’s approvals for the latest COVID vaccines, issued in August, are narrower than the new ACIP guidance, limiting approved eligibility to people over 65 or those with risky underlying conditions. The FDA’s limits have already made it harder for many people to get a vaccine without an “off-label” prescription from a doctor. The diverging and unclear guidance had already resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/states-rfk-vaccine-access-cost-00556969"&gt;widespread confusion&lt;/a&gt; among state governments and pharmacies trying to preserve access and led to even people within the eligible groups being unable to get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/health/cdc-vaccines-mmrv-hepatitis-b.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTabling%20the%20vote%20is%20appropriate%20and%20a%20relief%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Dr.%20Noele%20P.%20Nelson%2C%20a%20senior%20author%20on%20the%20current%20guidelines%20for%20the%20vaccine%20and%20a%20former%20leader%20of%20the%20C.D.C.%E2%80%99s%20hepatitis%20vaccines%20work%20group."&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt; relief that infant access to the hepatitis B immunization was unchanged and that the recommendation for the MMR and varicella vaccines was not rolled back even if the option of the MMRV combo shot is now set to be removed from the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of like low intensity, what they did in some ways. … [O]nly 15 percent of kids took the combo,” Demetre Daskalakis, the former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s more the principle, that they—with no data, with no reason to do it—have just removed a vaccine from the pediatric schedule.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the two-day meeting in Atlanta highlighted how successful Kennedy has been in supplanting scientific decision-making and evidence-based evaluation with rote vaccine skepticism. Many of the panel members’ statements and presentations suggest ACIP will continue on a trajectory away from consensus and data-driven vaccine analysis and toward a vaccine-skeptical agenda marked by increased confusion and polarization.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who has served as a paid expert witness in litigation against vaccine manufacturers, opened the meeting by laying down a gauntlet to the committee’s critics. “When there are different scientific views, only trust scientists who are willing to engage with and publicly debate the scientists with other views,” he said. “With such debates, you can weigh and determine the scientific reasoning by each side, but without it, you cannot properly judge their arguments.” He cited an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; authored by nine former CDC directors criticizing Kennedy and ACIP, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=2678"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; them to a public debate: “If they want to be trusted, they should accept.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad vaccine policy or public health goals are topics appropriate for an open debate setting. But evaluating highly technical and scientifically complex studies and safety data is not an exercise well-suited to the debating stage, but rather, a structured, collaborative discussion where different perspectives and questions can be explored on a foundation of validated and accepted evidence—something the ACIP and its working groups were previously known for and had formalized through its evidence-to-recommendation &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/media/pdfs/2024/09/ACIP-Evidence-to-Recommendations-Framework-cdc.pdf"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Kennedy remade ACIP in June, the panel abandoned that process, including much of the public transparency that came with it. The details of the proposed changes the committee would be voting on, for example, were not announced publicly before the meeting last week began—in fact, CDC staff preparing materials for the meeting apparently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=23600"&gt;didn’t know&lt;/a&gt; the specifics of some proposals until the night before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several committee liaisons representing outside medical groups during the meeting asked why ACIP is considering new recommendations for these vaccines in the first place. Prior to Kennedy’s installment at HHS, ACIP would schedule votes on changes to recommendations when new circumstances (e.g., a public health emergency or a new vaccine) or new data and studies arose that prompted reconsideration. The process for developing a potential new recommendation or change to an existing one would often take the better part of a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of that process was clear throughout the meeting but particularly when it came to  the proposal to push the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose for infants back to 1 month of age. Members seeming to favor the change did not offer new safety evidence justifying the shift nor did they make clear why 1 month was selected. “Why would we pick 1 month, why [not] 2 months?” asked Cody Meissner, a vaccine expert and pediatrician who’s also the only current ACIP member who has served on the panel before. “There is no evidence that it’s safer at a later time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no evidence of harm from administering the neonatal vaccine that I’ve heard presented or that I’m aware of,” he added.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is there really a reason that the committee can provide for making a change?” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=20172"&gt;pressed&lt;/a&gt; Flor Muñoz, a pediatrician and ACIP liaison representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the meeting, committee member Robert Malone addressed the query. “I think the question in my mind is a little disingenuous,” he said. “The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety, it’s one of trust. It’s one of parents being uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malone added that “hopefully, [parents] are comforted by the data that have been provided, but I suspect that many concerns will linger.” He also noted that he had received no communication from anyone at CDC as to why ACIP was reviewing the hepatitis B recommendation now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the comments also highlighted what was on display throughout the meeting: the elevation of vaccine skepticism for skepticism’s sake, even in the face of contradictory evidence. While CDC staff presented a systematic review of data on the hepatitis B vaccine, noting strong evidence indicating its safety, Malone insisted, “The absence of data that statistically proves lack of safety does not mean that the product is safe.” Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, advanced a similar line.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease experts and former public health officials panned the members’ comments as removed from scientific reality. “You can’t prove absolute safety—that’s proving a negative,” Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and clinical associate professor at Stanford University, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1969063501290483928"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; on X in response to Malone’s comments. “We don’t have ‘absence of data.’ We have mountains of evidence. You’re demanding logical impossibilities while ignoring decades of proof.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Frieden, the CDC director during the Obama administration, &lt;a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-173993005"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, “There were statements that ‘concerns’ and ‘trust’ are more important than data—including by members who themselves, or whose organizations, have been primary disseminators of disinformation about vaccines.” Kennedy’s new picks seemed to be doing exactly what he has long accused the public health establishment of doing: substituting personal priors and ideology for sound science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee’s discussion of COVID vaccine information also frustrated observers, as when Levi raised concerns about mRNA used in the shots lingering in the body after vaccination. Drew Weissman, the director of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school and a recipient of the 2023 Nobel Prize for work that helped lead to the development of the COVID vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/20/drew-weissman-nobel-prize-mrna-covid-vaccines-rebuts-retsef-levi-claims/#:~:text=What%20these%20people,just%20not%20true."&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the claims rely on cherry-picked research and bad information. “What these people do, is that they search, they find one paper or two papers that make an outlandish claim based on bad data that hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of other papers refute, they don’t mention everything that refutes it,” he told &lt;em&gt;Stat &lt;/em&gt;in an interview after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some panel members veered into anecdotes and speculation about vaccine safety effects while committee liaisons and even other panel members emphasized the lack of data to support their colleagues’ assertions. “We’re going beyond data and turning into a discussion of speculation and a discussion of possible clinical outcomes for which we have no data,” Joseph Hibbeln, a neuroscientist who previously worked at the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=18842"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during the discussion of the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And during both days, confusion among the committee members was apparent, with some uncertain of what exactly they were voting on, how the voting procedures worked, or even what effects their decisions would have on vaccine policy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the panel voted to preserve access to the MMRV combo shot under the Vaccines for Children Program, which subsidizes vaccines for uninsured or underinsured families, even though the move conflicted with its previous vote to drop the recommendation for the combo shot. Committee members opened the second day of the meeting explaining that they were confused and had made the vote in error. As Kulldorff, the committee chair, prepared to reverse the vote, he praised the “enormous depth and knowledge” the panel possessed on vaccines and science but noted that nearly all of the members “are rookies” on the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many technical issues that we might not grasp as of yet,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;        
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Dispatch</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 09:26:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5fNGJsSHlQQVpMVnFFa3o1eDRqMG9acHBYNF80VE9yLXBfTWRZdW0yRTJZTTVncHBmSXc2aVZUU2VYVHFpSy1YU2JFR1EtZHE0dk0wWmp0MWtZejZUYTlKbW1PbmdReHVjSFN5aGh5TmpkUjNVc1A5ZTBOVQ</guid></item><item><title>专家说，在饮食中加入这种成分可以帮助您过上更长寿、更健康的生活-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-fitness/polyphenols-benefits-and-anti-ageing-effects-b2831125.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWHDRo sc-jbiisr-1 sc-1wfc891-0 fooWDH" id="main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="big-letter"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;ietary advice often hinges on eating less. In the rare instance we are told to eat more of something, the subject nowadays is invariably &lt;a href="/topic/protein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/topic/fibre"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt;. But there is another naturally occurring dietary compound – present in berries, green tea, coffee and even dark chocolate – which recent research suggests can have geroprotective effects. In layman’s terms: it may help protect against, or slow down, the biological processes involved in &lt;a href="/topic/ageing"&gt;ageing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polyphenols are a large family of plant compounds,” explains Dr Karan Rajan, a medical doctor and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThis-Book-Save-Your-Life%2Fdp%2F1529136326%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2831125%7C1529136326%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Book May Save Your Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This includes flavonoids like EGCG [epigallocatechin gallate] in green tea, phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid in coffee, and many others. They act as antioxidants with anti-inflammatory properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review article, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163725000790"&gt;Ageing Research Reviews&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2025, suggested that “polyphenols may exert geroprotective effects by modulating the hallmarks of ageing” after observing a high consumption of polyphenol-rich foods in “blue zones” – five regions across the world where people have been observed to live significantly longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you, too, could increase your lifespan by including a few more berries and cups of green tea in your weekly routine? As always, the answer is more nuanced than that. Here, a team of nutritional and medical experts unpick the extent of polyphenol’s health-boosting properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say about polyphenols? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original blue zones are Sardinia in Italy, Okinawa in Japan, Ikaria in Greece, Nicoya in Costa Rica and Loma Linda in California. With longevity a hot topic in the 21st century, these regions have been subject to many headlines and books exploring the correlates between the lifestyles and lifespans of their populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v3"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; by demographer Dr Saul Justin Newman questioned the concept of blue zones due to bad data, such as the absence of birth certificates in the highlighted regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only 18 per cent of ‘exhaustively’ validated supercentenarians [those aged significantly above 100 – usually 110] have a birth certificate, falling to zero per cent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error,” it reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 review article on polyphenols uses long-lived individuals living in these blue zones, who remain free from chronic diseases, as a “valuable model to investigate the complex interplay of biological, genetic and environmental factors that contribute to exceptional longevity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It recognises that, while centenarians are inclined towards polyphenol-rich plant-based diets, longevity is not just determined through diet but also a blend of lifestyle and socio-cultural factors. It also lists a series of limitations, such as a lack of data around the exact polyphenol intake of those living in the blue zones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it does identify “associations between higher polyphenol consumption and the lower incidence of age-related diseases in these populations”, adding that “a significant body of evidence suggests that polyphenols… may exhibit geroprotective activity by influencing underlying biological mechanisms of ageing and promoting optimal longevity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/japanese-walking-method-10000-steps-a-day-b2828117.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/heart-health-attack-cardio-exercise-b2785415.html"&gt;A cardiac nurse says these five daily behaviours can reduce your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 foHptA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/9/39/na-visky-3hRRT4qztzs-unsplash.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/9/39/na-visky-3hRRT4qztzs-unsplash.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/9/39/na-visky-3hRRT4qztzs-unsplash.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Green tea contains polyphenols in the form of flavonoids like EGCG" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5180"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Green tea contains polyphenols in the form of flavonoids like EGCG&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Unsplash/@navisky)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while the concept of blue zones has been called into question, the study concludes that evidence suggests polyphenols can still have a positive impact on the ageing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experts generally agree, but also point to other factors at play in deciding the length of someone’s life, and the health with which it is lived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Populations in so-called ‘blue zones’ tend to eat diets naturally higher in polyphenols by up to 30 per cent, compared to the average diet,” says Dr Richard Allison, nutritionist at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.herbalife.com/en-gb"&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;. “While it’s not the only factor – exercise, community and overall lifestyle play a role too – research suggests polyphenols may help explain some of their healthy ageing advantages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a dietary perspective, a high intake of plant-based foods has been noted in these areas, which would provide a significant supply of polyphenols, as well as fibre and other key nutrients,” adds Kerry Beeson, a nutritional therapist with &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fprepkitchen.co.uk%2F&amp;amp;articleId=b2831125&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Prep Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; who holds a degree in nutritional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, blue zones are not the only regions with high plant food consumption, which suggests that polyphenols alone may not be the sole explanation. &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-recipe-three-ingredients-muscles-nhs-surgeon-b2802823.html"&gt;Gut health&lt;/a&gt; has also been investigated as an important factor in longevity, for example. On that note, there may be an important synergy there, as polyphenols can act as prebiotics, working with dietary fibre and &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-fermented-foods-kimchi-b2765194.html"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; to support a diverse microbiome that in turn positively influences immunity, inflammation, and ultimately, healthy ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, Dr Rajan points to links between diets high in polyphenols, such as the &lt;a href="/news/health/mediterranean-diet-gum-disease-weight-loss-b2826640.html"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and blue zone diet, and cardiometabolic and anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, most evidence is observational, so we can’t isolate polyphenols as the sole driver of longevity,” he says. “Other factors such as genetics, sleep, activity levels, lower smoking and processed food intake all play big roles. Publication bias and ‘healthy user effect’ can also skew findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/balance-exercise-plan-pilates-b2815218.html"&gt;The important thing your exercise plan is probably missing – particularly if you’re older&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 geLykb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/16/18/iStock-1693980555-copy.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/16/18/iStock-1693980555-copy.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/16/18/iStock-1693980555-copy.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Sardinia in Italy is one of five ‘blue zones’ in the world – areas where people have been observed to lead longer, healthier lives" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5181"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Sardinia in Italy is one of five ‘blue zones’ in the world – areas where people have been observed to lead longer, healthier lives&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

in coffee, ferulic acid in whole grains and gallic acid in tea, grapes and berries. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proanthocyanidins: found in fruits like grapes and apples, as well as cocoa and dark chocolate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lignans: found in wholefoods such as flaxseeds and sesame seeds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stilbenes: the most well-known polyphenol in this category is resveratrol in red grapes and wine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Special cases: some polyphenols don’t fall into the main categories, such as curcumin, a unique curcuminoid found only in turmeric. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2806102.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gPaeol"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/11/09/09125147-7a27edc5-f07e-4135-9adf-83b9c340d2b2.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/11/09/09125147-7a27edc5-f07e-4135-9adf-83b9c340d2b2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/11/09/09125147-7a27edc5-f07e-4135-9adf-83b9c340d2b2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Red wine contains polyphenols, although Dr Karan Rajan adds that ‘alcohol obviously has downsides for gut health and it is more generally linked to increased risk of cancers, so grapes are better’" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5182"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Red wine contains polyphenols, although Dr Karan Rajan adds that ‘alcohol obviously has downsides for gut health and it is more generally linked to increased risk of cancers, so grapes are better’&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

They can help improve cardiometabolic function, support endothelial function (related to the lining of the blood vessels) and they have anti-inflammatory effects. Polyphenols may also aid lipid modulation and directly impact gut microbiome health, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the gut, they exhibit prebiotic properties to feed “good bacteria”, and offer antimicrobial effects against pathogenic microorganisms (those capable of causing disease), Beeson explains, citing a 2019 review published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770155/"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continues: “Polyphenols act as antioxidants, reducing oxidative stress and helping protect cells from damage.

They can improve how your body handles blood sugar, supporting energy balance and diabetes prevention, and polyphenols may slow some of the cellular processes linked with ageing, helping you stay healthier for longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-stretches-flexibility-daily-routine-b2806736.html"&gt;Five stretches you should be doing every day according to a flexibility expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fnzsRm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Polyphenols can improve how your body handles blood sugar and support energy balance, says nutritionist Dr Richard Allison" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5183"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Polyphenols can improve how your body handles blood sugar and support energy balance, says nutritionist Dr Richard Allison&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which foods contain polyphenols?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll get polyphenols from a wide variety of plant-based foods,” says Dr Allison.

Of course, these benefits are also linked to regular dietary patterns consumed over long periods of time, rather than occasional intake of polyphenols.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Alison suggests aiming for a slightly higher total of 1,000mg per day, which he says is “usually sufficient to see visible benefits including general anti-inflammatory health and cardiovascular health”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is roughly the equivalent of a cup of berries, two to three cups of green tea or coffee and a small piece of dark chocolate plus, supplemented by regular intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and olive oil throughout the day, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll usually start noticing benefits like better energy, digestion, and recovery within a few weeks of consistent intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rajan, on the other hand, suggests people should focus less on a specific amount or concentration of polyphenols, and more on overall dietary patterns to see improvements to their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A Mediterranean-style diet is naturally rich in polyphenols,” he says. “Small daily choices, like opting for black coffee, snacking on a couple of squares of dark chocolate, eating some mixed berries and having olive oil with meals, will add up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/longevity-ageing-exercise-personal-trainer-b2779460.html"&gt;I’m a trainer specialising in longevity – these are the five changes that have the biggest impact on my clients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cizAnP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/06/20/iStock-155556909.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/06/20/iStock-155556909.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/06/20/iStock-155556909.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The benefits of small dietary changes, such as opting for black coffee, will add up over time, according to Dr Karan Rajan" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5185"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The benefits of small dietary changes, such as opting for black coffee, will add up over time, according to Dr Karan Rajan&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to enjoy a healthier diet rich in polyphenols&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rajan says that, based on existing evidence, it is likely that polyphenols have geroprotective qualities. This is largely thanks to their positive impact on heart and blood vessel health, anti-inflammatory properties and benefits for the gut microbiome, according to Beeson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to incorporate more polyphenols into your weekly diet, consistency is key, Dr Allison advises. Below, our three experts share their top tips for doing so, as well as providing a few suggestions for improving the general quality of your diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on dietary patterns, not supplements. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combine polyphenol-rich foods such as coffee, berries, olive oil, nuts and cocoa with fibre – fibre is crucial as it feeds gut bacteria, which then transform polyphenols into beneficial compounds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rotate and diversify plant foods and fibres for the best effect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evidence for polyphenol supplements is weak compared to whole foods, so it’s always best to get polyphenols from natural food sources. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips from Dr Richard Allison, nutritionist at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.herbalife.com/en-gb"&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start your morning with green tea or coffee. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a handful of berries to your breakfast or snacks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swap butter for olive oil when cooking. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snack on nuts and a square of dark chocolate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add turmeric to meals such as soups, curries or even smoothies, along with a pinch of black pepper to boost absorption. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips from Kerry Beeson BSc (nutritional medicine), nutritional therapist at &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fprepkitchen.co.uk%2F&amp;amp;articleId=b2831125&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Prep Kitchen:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace crisps and standard chocolate bars as snacks with a handful of nuts, some berries and a couple of squares of dark chocolate (70% cocoa and above). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recommended daily intake of five portions of fruit and vegetables isn’t enough. Aim for at least seven, and try to eat different colours to vary the types of polyphenols you consume – the brighter the better. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make your own polyphenol-rich salad dressing with ingredients like extra virgin olive oil, pomegranate nectar and lemon juice. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swap syrups and sugar for honey and maple syrup – these are further sources of polyphenols. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a cup or two of good quality tea or coffee each day – matcha green or white tea are the highest in polyphenols. Note that adding milk to your coffee lowers the absorption of polyphenols into your body, and it’s best taken warm, so an espresso shot is ideal. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include fibre-rich plant-based protein sources such as beans, lentils and chickpeas in your diet, as well as wholegrains like oats, brown rice and wholemeal bread. These are a staple in blue zone diets and rich in polyphenols. They also contain fibre to support gut health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add herbs and spices liberally when cooking. Fresh is best but dried versions are still useful sources. Also, consider using functional foods such as moringa and maca in smoothies and on cereal. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporate fermented foods such as kefir, sauerkraut or kimchi in your diet regularly. These not only contain beneficial compounds themselves but also support gut bacteria that help metabolise polyphenols efficiently. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-fermented-foods-kimchi-b2765194.html"&gt;I spoke to the man who wrote the book on fermentation – here is his golden rule for gut health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 09:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQT3pfOG1HdDZ3Q1pIMldtaVRIV3RDOVFzRGtIeDdyeGl0TWVQU1Izbi1VbmFmZ3hHU3JnZzZjU1lKUkNaQUNOTm5jTjBuRDF1RkxPdkNlWXRGX2I4OTVYR1BPSHUzcGFaN280VEUzd0RkNl9XOERrNWRXdXNtY2N5ZHdpQjdOMXF3UEFoNFJLT1VRTEVycmVrWFYxS2x3d3VWX2Q4R2xFMTNCamM</guid></item><item><title>美容和健康大师喜欢它。关于海苔的说法是下沉还是游泳？ - NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5539099/sea-moss-supplements-health-nutrition-beauty</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;What grows in the ocean, is packed full of nutrients and, if you listen to wellness influencers, can do everything from&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/10/nx-s1-5254349/gut-health-microbiome-vegan-vegetarian-omnivore" target="_blank"&gt; boosting your gut health&lt;/a&gt; to giving you glowing skin? It's sea moss, the latest social media superfood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sea moss is actually a generic term used to describe different red seaweed plants that grow in the North Atlantic, particularly off the Irish coast, as well as in warmer waters such as in parts of the Carribean, says &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" target="_blank"&gt;Vanessa King&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;King says you've probably eaten a sea moss product without knowing it. It's long been harvested for its carrageenan, which is used in the food industry as a thickening agent and emulsifier in products like ice cream and puddings, even nut milks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;These days, you'll also find sea moss sold as pills, powders, gummies, dried flakes and often, as an edible gel made from sea moss that has been soaked in water.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;TikTok content creators and celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber have embraced sea moss as part of their wellness and beauty routines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the buzz has translated into a global sea moss market that's projected to be worth nearly $3 billion by 2030, according to&lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/sea-moss-market-report" target="_blank"&gt; an analysis by Grand View Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But does the evidence actually back up the hype?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The Claim&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On TikTok, you'll find content creators praising sea moss for &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@georgianingg/video/7330875726045957394" target="_blank"&gt;clearing their acne and giving them radiant skin&lt;/a&gt;, improving digestion, boosting energy and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maggieroseadvocate/video/7427520214532640042?lang=en&amp;amp;q=sea%20moss%20health%20benefits%20&amp;amp;t=1758236770552" target="_blank"&gt;helping with weight management and better sleep&lt;/a&gt;. In the Caribbean, sea moss is sometimes sold in a drink that's said to be a &lt;a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/jamaican-irish-moss-drink#:~:text=Jamaica,behemoth%20known%20as%20Peanut%20Punch." target="_blank"&gt;male libido booster&lt;/a&gt;, King says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in both Ireland and the Caribbean, you can find recipes dating back to the 1800s that treat sea moss as a form of food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite a long tradition of using sea moss for its alleged beauty and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5399181/from-fitness-fads-to-mental-health-trends-how-wellness-became-an-american-epidemic" target="_blank"&gt; wellness boosting &lt;/a&gt;properties, "we still don't have much research to support the health claims that our celebrities are endorsing," King says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most of the claims are based on &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Does-Eating-Sea-Moss-Provide-Health-Benefits.aspx#:~:text=Sea%20moss%20provides%20soluble%20fibers,systemic%20lipid%20and%20glucose%20metabolism." target="_blank"&gt;cell or animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, which don't always translate to humans. "Even the human trials that we have are small and of short duration," &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=15727" target="_blank"&gt;says Dr. Melinda Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of the Osher Center for Integrative Health at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's not to say sea moss has no health benefits. Ring says sea moss in its whole form is a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/19/1196977677/easy-ways-to-add-more-fiber-to-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;good source of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals like zinc, which do support gut health and the immune system. But you can also get these nutrients from lots of other foods, not just sea moss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So can it be potentially beneficial? Yes." Ring says. "Can it be more beneficial than other sources? Probably not. It's just one of many things that we can use to support our health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says there is emerging evidence that the prebiotic fibers in sea moss can support a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The risks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Ring says consuming too much sea moss also poses potential risks. "One is that sea moss can accumulate heavy metals like arsenic, lead and mercury, particularly if it's been sourced from contaminated water. So that's a big concern," Ring says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666154325002017" target="_blank"&gt;published in June &lt;/a&gt;found that excessive or prolonged consumption of contaminated seaweed can lead to a buildup of heavy metals in the body, posing serious health risks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another concern: Sea moss is rich in iodine. We need some iodine for good thyroid health, but too much can potentially trigger thyroid dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ring says people with thyroid disorders or who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid sea moss. So should people on blood thinners, because sea moss contains vitamin K, which can interfere with these medications.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;If you want to try it&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One study found that powdered sea moss — the kind you might find in capsules — &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924796308002972" target="_blank"&gt;contained cadmium and lead at levels that exceeded&lt;/a&gt; limits set by California. That's why Ring says, if you do try sea moss, stick to it as a whole food or in gel form instead of supplements. Plus, you'll get more fiber this way, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;King notes that the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate supplements with the same rigor as pharmaceuticals. She notes that studies have found that supplements in general can contain way more of an ingredient than they say, so if you do choose to try a supplement, look for one tested by a third party to "make sure you're buying what you think you're buying."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you want to dip your toes into the sea moss trend, skip the supplements and try cooking with it instead, King suggests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or feel free to ignore the whole trend altogether, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-guevara-mph-rd/" target="_blank"&gt;Diana Guevara&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary registered dietician with the U.T. Health Houston School of Public Health. While sea moss can be healthy, she says it's no magic elixir.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You know, we want things to be easy and quick," Guevara says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to good health she says, "it really is just that whole lifestyle of including more fruits, more vegetables, more whole grains and really just looking for that balance" in your diet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It may not be trendiest advice, but it is backed by science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not always what happens. And the reason is often financial: Federal regulators can fine hospitals hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars if too many of their patients get &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/value-based-programs/hospital-acquired-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hospital-acquired infections&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some hospital leaders, realizing that if they don’t look for infections, they won’t find them, are discouraging testing, clinicians told STAT. Without testing, patients may not get the best treatment. Executives have also pressured staffers in some cases not to report infections to the government, they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, regulators have known about the problem for a decade, but neither Medicare nor Congress has taken action to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is like health care’s dirty little secret,” said Carol McLay, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. “Everybody knows it’s done. Nobody talks about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the uncomfortable truth about &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/increase-health-benefits-of-walking-b2774984.html" title="Four science-backed ways to make your daily walk even better for your health"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; is that, to prompt positive physical changes, you usually have to do more of it, or at least progress it in some way – &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fitness-myths-weight-loss-calorie-deficit-b2823264.html" title="From exercising for fat loss to building muscle in a calorie deficit – doctor of sport science corrects three fitness myths"&gt;running further&lt;/a&gt; or lifting &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/weightlifting-muscle-hypertrophy-dumbbell-b2819419.html" title="I have a PhD in strength training – stop using the wrong weights for your workouts with this simple test"&gt;heavier weights&lt;/a&gt; for more sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This requires time, which is something most people are in short supply of. But there are ways to achieve more in your workouts while taking a smaller chunk of your day – particularly when it comes to &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People assume that when you’re working out you need to spend hours and hours in the gym to get benefits,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://wolfcoaching.com/about"&gt;Dr Milo Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, a fitness coach and founder of training app &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://myoadapt.com/"&gt;MyoAdapt&lt;/a&gt;, who holds a PhD in sport science specialising in strength training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In reality, you don’t need to spend that much time in the gym to start seeing results. If you employ certain strategies, you can get away with as little as 30-60 minutes in the gym each week and still see really solid progress, even if you’ve been lifting for several years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, he explains the theory behind six of these strategies, and shares a two workouts per week plan you can follow with just a few dumbbells to develop strength, boost bone density, build muscle, improve mobility and experience the plethora of other benefits strength training has to offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique one: Maximise the efficacy of each set &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is a victim of diminishing returns, so performing more sets of an exercise in a bid to build more muscle will not necessarily be the smartest move for efficiency or overall results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s say you do five to 10 sets per week on each muscle group – you’re going to get a solid amount of your potential muscle growth and results from the gym,” Wolf says. “But when you go from five to 10 sets per week for each muscle group to 20, 30 or more, that’s where the benefits really start to taper off. You’re getting less bang for your buck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, he recommends focusing on a few heavy sets per week on each muscle group, and trying to make them as effective as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To make these sets as effective as possible, you want to take those sets close to failure [where your muscles have tired to the point you cannot perform another rep with good form],” says Wolf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good signifier of reaching this stage is that your movements should involuntarily slow down during the last few reps of a set as a result of muscular fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How close to failure you should go is still a topic of ongoing research,” Wolf adds. “From my reading of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38970765/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, if you only do a few sets per week on each muscle group, you probably want to take them at least to failure, and potentially even past failure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be done through techniques such as drop sets, which he explains in one of the sections below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Across dozens of studies, we see that the closer you go to failure overall, the more muscle growth you see,” Wolf adds. “Because training to failure doesn’t take any additional time, it is one of the strategies you can employ to grow muscle more efficiently.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/weightlifting-muscle-hypertrophy-dumbbell-b2819419.html"&gt;I have a PhD in strength training – stop using the wrong weights for your workouts with this simple test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hIWccK"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/01/9/18/Strength-training-offers-long-lasting-benefits-which-can-protect-your-health-and-functionality-for-y.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/01/9/18/Strength-training-offers-long-lasting-benefits-which-can-protect-your-health-and-functionality-for-y.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/01/9/18/Strength-training-offers-long-lasting-benefits-which-can-protect-your-health-and-functionality-for-y.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Taking each set close to failure has been linked with greater muscle growth." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210888"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Taking each set close to failure has been linked with greater muscle growth.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique two: Antagonistic supersets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The two techniques we have the most research on for saving time and still getting the same amount of muscle growth are drop sets and &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs42978-020-00092-z&amp;amp;articleId=b2827434&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;antagonistic supersets&lt;/a&gt;,” says Wolf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has co-authored a paper on this topic, with the take-home message being that they can deliver similar levels of muscle growth in approximately half the time of a traditional strength training set-up – ie performing a set, resting for 60-plus seconds, then performing another set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what is an antagonistic superset, and how can it streamline your strength training efforts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most muscles exist in antagonistic pairs. This simply means the muscles in this pairing contract and relax to deliver opposing functions – for example, the biceps contract to flex the elbow and bend your arm, then the biceps muscles relax and the triceps contract to extend it again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An antagonistic superset involves working these muscles back to back with no rest in between. After you have completed both exercises, you take a break before repeating the sequence, thus cutting out half of the usual rest intervals you would have during your strength training session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Effectively, while one muscle is resting, the other one is training,” explains Wolf. “Because a biceps curl targets the biceps on the front of your arm, then a triceps extension targets the triceps on the back of your arm, performing the opposite joint function, they are not going to overlap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further examples of antagonistic supersets could be a chest exercise like the press-up and a back exercise like the bent-over row, or a quadriceps-dominant exercise like the &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squat&lt;/a&gt; and a hamstring-dominant exercise like the Romanian &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-deadlift-correctly-b2603126.html"&gt;deadlift&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need to pick two exercises that target antagonistic or opposite muscles either,” adds Wolf. “You can also superset any two exercises that don’t have any meaningful overlap. Something like a calf raise and a lateral raise [for the shoulders], for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2806102.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 WYhPC"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/11/39/Regular-strength-training-offers-impressive-bang-for-your-buck-particularly-for-beginners-says-exper.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/11/39/Regular-strength-training-offers-impressive-bang-for-your-buck-particularly-for-beginners-says-exper.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/11/39/Regular-strength-training-offers-impressive-bang-for-your-buck-particularly-for-beginners-says-exper.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Performing supersets – two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between – can cut down the number of rest intervals needed in your workout, reducing the overall time it takes." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210889"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Performing supersets – two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between – can cut down the number of rest intervals needed in your workout, reducing the overall time it takes.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique three: Drop sets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have around six to 10 studies now comparing drop sets with traditional strength training,” Wolf says. “In these studies, we see that drop set training leads to the same muscle growth [as traditional strength training] in 30-70 per cent less time, depending on the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://journal.iusca.org/index.php/Journal/article/view/135"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. So if you were previously working out for an hour-and-a-half, you could be looking at spending more like half an hour in the gym instead and still seeing the same results – which is great.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as with the antagonistic supersets above, it’s important to understand what a drop set is, and how you can use them to build muscle more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With drop set training, you start with a heavy set to failure, then immediately after finishing this, you drop the weight you’re lifting by roughly 20 per cent and complete another set to failure with this new, lighter weight,” Wolf explains. “Straight after this second set, drop the weight by about 20 per cent again and complete another set to failure. Continue this until you have completed your target number of sets.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set will usually have a target number of repetitions to aim for – usually between eight and 12 – then for the subsequent sets, your goal is to perform as many reps as you can with good technique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different people might get different numbers of reps on the drop sets because of their physiology,” Wolf explains. “Some people might be able to hit 10 reps on that second set, while others may only manage six. To prescribe a set number of reps is probably doing a disservice to how unique each person is.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://journal.iusca.org/index.php/Journal/article/view/135"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, for every one normal set you would usually do, you should typically do 1.6 drop sets to see similar results, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means if you would usually do three sets of 10 on an exercise, you could swap this for a drop set with five subsequent lighter sets in quick succession – a taxing but far more time-savvy procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-nutrition-diet-b2789919.html"&gt;Eat these two foods weekly to improve gut health and reduce tummy troubles, nutrition expert says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dzgyhB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/16/07/Dr-Milo-Wolf-says-many-people-particularly-beginners-underestimate-their-abilities-in-the-gym-and-co.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/16/07/Dr-Milo-Wolf-says-many-people-particularly-beginners-underestimate-their-abilities-in-the-gym-and-co.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/16/07/Dr-Milo-Wolf-says-many-people-particularly-beginners-underestimate-their-abilities-in-the-gym-and-co.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Milo Wolf says drop sets – performing a set of an exercise to failure, then reducing the weight you are lifting and performing another max-effort set – is another way to train more efficiently." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210890"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Dr Milo Wolf says drop sets – performing a set of an exercise to failure, then reducing the weight you are lifting and performing another max-effort set – is another way to train more efficiently.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique four: Exercise selection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might seem obvious, but it is a point that is often overlooked. Choosing exercises that require less prep work will save you time in the gym. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, rather than biding your time for a turn on the bench press, could you hit your chest with a few hard sets of press-ups? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dumbbell exercises are going to be more efficient than the barbell alternatives,” Wolf says. “With a barbell, you need to warm up, load the plates, then unload them and put them away afterwards. While that might not seem like much, that’s a few minutes you could spend doing an extra one or two sets of a dumbbell exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The same applies for stack-loaded machines and bodyweight movements, as long as the resistance is sufficient to get a solid stimulus [ie you can take each set close to failure].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/longevity-ageing-exercise-personal-trainer-b2779460.html"&gt;I’m a trainer specialising in longevity – these are the five changes that have the biggest impact on my clients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cdhirR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/08/20/10/newFile-4.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/08/20/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/08/20/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Replacing a barbell exercise with a dumbbell exercise targetting the same muscles can save you from having to load and unload the bar, granting you a few extra minutes to squeeze in some valuable additional sets of other exercises." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210891"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Replacing a barbell exercise with a dumbbell exercise targetting the same muscles can save you from having to load and unload the bar, granting you a few extra minutes to squeeze in some valuable additional sets of other exercises.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique five: Do a no-frills warm-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people spend a lot of time on their warm-up, which is an honourable endeavour – no one wants to pick up an injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/559"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; trumpets the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/75109"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/559"&gt;mental merits&lt;/a&gt; of a shorter warm-up. This is particularly true in a controlled environment like a gym, where injury risk is relatively very low when compared to the dynamism and unpredictability of field sports such as football. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to save time, warming up should be kept to the bare bones,” says Wolf. “Warm-ups can be important, especially for sports, but for lifting, there are a few points to take note of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firstly, the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1360859224004017#bib3"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; we have suggests just one fairly heavy set [between 70-90 per cent of your one-rep max] of one to three reps, before your first actual training set, tends to be all you need to elicit a boost in performance. It’s heavy, but it’s a very feasible set, and it should make your first training set feel a lot more manageable. If you’re already walking or cycling to the gym, that one fairly heavy set might be enough to cover your warm-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolf also points out that any time spent warming up is time not spent on your actual workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you go to the gym for 60 minutes and spend 20 minutes warming up, that is 40 minutes where you are not working hard,” he says. “If your warm-up takes five minutes, you have 55 minutes of actual working out, and so you’re likely to see more health benefits, muscle growth and overall progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, when training with sub-maximal loads and a primary goal of building muscle, Wolf likes to keep his warm-ups to just a few minutes. He has found a set of six to 10 reps of the exercise he is going to be doing, at 40 per cent of his one-rep max, followed by a set of one to three reps at 70-80 per cent of his one-rep max, works well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fitness-tips-weight-loss-b2810890.html"&gt;If you struggle to stay fit, try adding these nine simple science-backed behaviours into your week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ezwNXu"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/24/10/woman-exercising-in-gym.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/24/10/woman-exercising-in-gym.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/24/10/woman-exercising-in-gym.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="For strength training sessions, Wolf says warm-ups can usually be kept to five minutes." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210892"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;For strength training sessions, Wolf says warm-ups can usually be kept to five minutes.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique six: Workout frequency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in finding an effective workout routine is identifying one that suits your schedule – the workouts you do are always going to deliver greater results than the workouts you miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for those trying to maximise their training efficiency, Wolf says two to three weekly full-body workouts hits the sweet spot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/460"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, we generally see that training a muscle twice a week is a bit better than training it once a week,” he explains. “So, doing one hour-long workout might be slightly worse than doing two 20-30-minute workouts. For this reason, I would suggest adopting a full-body routine where every major muscle group gets hit at least twice per week, and I would focus heavily on compound movements – exercises that target multiple muscles at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each workout, Wolf recommends including exercises covering four movement patterns which, between them, “cover most bases”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the hip hinge for the lower body, so things like deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts and even hip thrusts,” he says. “The other important movement pattern for the lower body is some sort of squat or lunge pattern, so we’re talking about a high bar squat, Bulgarian split squat or dumbbell step-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then there’s a horizontal press, training your chest, triceps, front deltoids and even your lateral deltoids with things like the dumbbell chest press, dips and deficit press-ups. And the final movement pattern to include is going to be a horizontal pull. The reason a horizontal pull is so important is because it gets a good amount of stimulus to the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, mid trapezius and lower trapezius [the muscles across your back].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So if I was constructing two or three full-body workouts per week and I wanted maximum bang for your buck in terms of bone health, overall resilience, better functionality in day-to-day life and muscle growth, I would just focus on getting those four movement patterns in and doing two or three sets of each per workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fitness-myths-weight-loss-calorie-deficit-b2823264.html"&gt;From exercising for fat loss to building muscle in a calorie deficit – doctor of sport science corrects three fitness myths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 djHxeM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/07/11/iStock-700614430.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/07/11/iStock-700614430.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/07/11/iStock-700614430.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Two to three weekly full-body workotus, twinned with walking 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day, will offer ‘the vast majority of benefits from exercise’, according to Wolf" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210893"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Two to three weekly full-body workotus, twinned with walking 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day, will offer ‘the vast majority of benefits from exercise’, according to Wolf&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr Milo Wolf’s two-day workout plan for busy people &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-wn0aau-0 lnUWhb kfwxdp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two workouts below should take roughly 20 minutes each, and they are to be performed on different days of the week. When arranging them in your week, leave at least one full day between the two workouts. Beyond this, you can be flexible as to how and when you incorporate them into your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each workout comprises four exercises, to be performed as two supersets – paired movements are signified by the labels A and B. In practice, this means you will start the first workout by performing five to eight repetitions of the flat dumbbell press, immediately followed by five to eight repetitions of the incline dumbbell row. After this, you rest for 45 seconds then repeat this sequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have completed this sequence three times, you move on to the second set of exercises. All movements have been demonstrated in the video above. You can also find a video of a beginner workout which follows the same base principles underneath the tables below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Day one&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1A.

So, in contrast to things like getting your steps in or activities like running and cycling, where you generally see more health benefits the more you do, it seems like you can get most, if not all, the health benefits of lifting weights from around two hours per week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the term health encompasses myriad metrics including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and all-cause mortality. In Wolf’s words: “Strength training lowers your risk of basically every conceivable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most forms of activity do a similarly effective job, provided you do them consistently, at improving your health,” he continues. “But there are going to be slight additional benefits to lifting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, lifting weights has a relatively low injury rate when compared to high-impact activities like running and field sports such as football and tennis. It is performed in a controlled environment with a large emphasis on control and technique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fat-loss-advice-ben-carpenter-personal-trainer-b2751663.html"&gt;A personal trainer set out to learn everything he could about fat loss – this was his most important finding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dzgyhB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/17/iStock-2155616069.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/17/iStock-2155616069.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/17/iStock-2155616069.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Strength training has benefits to offer people of all ages, says Dr Milo Wolf" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210894"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Strength training has benefits to offer people of all ages, says Dr Milo Wolf&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has perks to offer people of all ages, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially as you get older, the body remembers,” says Wolf. “Even if you lifted, say, for a few years in your twenties or thirties, you will be better off for it in your sixties and seventies compared to someone who never lifted weights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to improve things like bone mineral density, which, as you age, helps reduce your risk of fractures and osteoporosis. Sarcopenia – the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength – is another big one [strength training helps to combat].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, Wolf describes lifting weights as the “single most powerful thing you can do for gaining muscle” – even beyond diet. And a strong body tends to be a robust body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the first line of intervention for improving sarcopenia, bone density, muscle, and generally improving nearly all of your health markers, while reducing the risk of virtually every disease,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe you can get the vast majority of health benefits from exercise by simply lifting a few times a week and aiming for a daily step count of 8,000 to 12,000. That can be a really simple approach for not overthinking exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because as much as many people focus on things like VO2 max and mitochondrial health, this is fixating on correlates of health rather than actual all-cause mortality risk. So I think focusing on behaviours that make you healthier, rather than the metrics that are associated with good health, is probably a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/balance-exercise-plan-pilates-b2815218.html"&gt;The important thing your exercise plan is probably missing – particularly if you’re older&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNWDBiRjRzcHRXMWpDVlpvcXFhbTJZVkZBQU9kdnV3UVVHTnU5WkphZzJlVHk1cmp6aTdsRkxFdUdSd0xTWVYxdlVEUzZkSjg1aWJ0YTBGMlNES3JVd0k1bWMyRFJUU29PZW9nNklWaTFUVFhWQTFFQjltZTBuNGo2ZlR2dG9jVGtIS21CTzlFSV9McnA4Y29HSFZoeXF3U0QxWFR4Zk9RSDZJZw</guid></item><item><title>干细胞修复中风引起的小鼠脑损伤- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells-repair-brain-damage-caused-by-stroke-in-mice</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

The mice even showed signs of improved movement and coordination – a key finding, as strokes can seriously impair the body's motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174951" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseBrain.jpg" alt="Mouse brain cross section." class="wp-image-174951 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseBrain.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseBrain-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Image of a mouse brain showing the stroke area (dashed circle) and the projections of the transplanted human stem cells (dark brown).

This is going to be important in developing actual treatments: it seems the brain needs to have stabilized to a certain extent after the stroke for the transplant to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4061516"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have covered some of the same ground, Tackenberg and team say none have gone into the same level of detail as this latest one. The researchers weren't just interested in the survival of implanted cells, but also in whether they might form neurological connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis goes far beyond the scope of other studies, which focused on the immediate effects right after transplantation," &lt;a href="https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/media/2025/stroke.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tackenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the damage that a stroke does to the brain is irreversible, and it's something that affects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930241308142"&gt;a quarter of the population&lt;/a&gt;. The internal bleeding or oxygen restriction caused by a stroke permanently destroys brain cells, which can significantly affect speech and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are hopeful that, given time,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="174948" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; therapy could be used to repair what is currently irreparable. We're already seeing multiple innovations in this area, including treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cells-reverse-type-1-diabetes-in-clinical-trial"&gt;for diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cell-transplant-restores-vision-in-multiple-people"&gt;vision loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this approach could work in human brains remains to be seen, and would need to be tested over a much longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of challenges ahead: any interference in the brain has the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-consciousness-detected-in-25-of-unresponsive-patients-tested"&gt;go wrong&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers need to find a way to prevent the implanted stem cells from going beyond their original remit, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is essential to pursue new therapeutic approaches to potential brain regeneration after diseases or accidents," &lt;a href="https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/media/2025/stroke.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tackenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that neural stem cells not only form new neurons, but also induce other regeneration processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63725-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Health blogs, wellness coaches, and even social media influencers call it a “miracle mineral” that can calm anxiety, improve sleep, ease muscle cramps, support heart health, and boost energy. With such loud claims, many people rush to add magnesium capsules, powders, or gummies into their daily routine. However, they meet a drastic sense of disappointment right after! Why? Not because the supplements aren’t working. It’s because, despite weeks of consistent use, there seems to be little or no noticeable effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puzzling experience leaves users asking an inevitable question: why doesn’t magnesium work, even when taken daily?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the truth is that magnesium plays a crucial role in over 300 biochemical processes in the body. But unlike the loud claims, its impact is often subtle, gradual, and highly dependent on other supporting yet crucial factors like diet, absorption, dosage, and underlying health conditions. Unlike stimulants such as caffeine or fast-acting painkillers, magnesium rarely produces an instant “kick.” Instead, its benefits tend to build slowly over time, sometimes so quietly that they go unnoticed unless carefully observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a detailed look at why magnesium supplements might not produce visible effects for many people, and what science says about making supplementation actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 01:57:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6AFBVV95cUxNZFBUMTRyczMyV00tMzdiQURQekRocVBNeDBHVWc1VEw2ZjFyY01pVjR6NXA2dDlVSXBvYU4tQmlqbXpCSWF4b0d0TjRUSGxLREdHcGU3dzRCbjJOVkNKVEZjbWJQSzRpLUtMcW5VQ1dwTXBCQ1BJcXI3SUpRWXNuUktVNE5SQ3lQZ3hMdmpBaXZ1dTJOaS1rWlhKcWxnYkdSM1NoS0F6empvYV9CMmlnRGRIZkFod2FPUWRibDlXcTdVVEdLbzRlOU9SZWxMTW8xWldFc2hESEtSNnM5OHVLR1NUaVpBVHdw0gHwAUFVX3lxTE83Qk5KbFlTSXl2Tjg2OGVXRFZxUm1HaE5pT1hIaW1uV0N5MmxsQVFUWWwyN19XMjEtVGJtdVJaZERNeXZrd0MtcVl0WDZkZm1KbjRaNWtUUXN4aG1wSG5wZlkzcFpOQUtmTk1pQTB2WE1mcmtPN1dLRjlETHJ2anhmNy1WUy1XNUlvTllhNVZXVXFJMjVLUFIwaGNmUGlMNW5mMkhRX0tZZGdZZDRDNkt5Y3lNME5pMThLdXFpQmhpNDQ2UGRGUlFadFdCQ1hnSE9kV1R4dmxnTTlVb3ZBYTl6VVJlN2h1bW1aSHhUU3VRRg</guid></item><item><title>女婴的父母说，当他们发出绝望的请求时，世界已经“分崩离析” -镜报</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/parents-baby-girl-say-world-35941313</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_420b4d" publication="mirror"&gt;Parents of baby girl say world has been 'blown apart' as they issue desperate plea&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_b38f47" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Six-month-old Rory has been in hospital since she was born due to a condition that causes the left ventricle of her heart to be stretched and enlarged - her parents are desperate for a donor and refuse to lose hope&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35941312"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Rory Fletcher has been hospitalised since her birth due to dilated cardiomyopathy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;The desperate &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt;

There can also be serious side effects, including potentially deadly brain haemorrhages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has sparked a debate about whether the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks, leading to national health regulators taking different stances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lecanemab, which is sold under the brand name Leqembi, has been approved in many countries including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But French health authorities advised the state-run insurance system not to reimburse payment for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It followed in the footsteps of the UK's state-run health service, whose spending watchdog said this year that both new Alzheimer's drugs did not show enough benefits given their price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164771" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164771" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AbnormalTauProteinsInterfereWithCellStructure-642x482.jpg" alt="Illustration of abnormal tau proteins interfering with microtubule formation" class="size-medium wp-image-164771" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AbnormalTauProteinsInterfereWithCellStructure-642x482.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AbnormalTauProteinsInterfereWithCellStructure-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AbnormalTauProteinsInterfereWithCellStructure-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AbnormalTauProteinsInterfereWithCellStructure.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164771" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormally modified tau proteins (orange) form tangles that disrupt microtubules and vesicle transport in nerve cells, a process linked to Alzheimer's disease.

No wonder so many people feel confused about how to actually get healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Joel Bikman, a long-time nutrition executive who is attempting to bring real science back into the conversation. His mission? To debunk the myths keeping people stuck — and replace them with evidence-based solutions that make lasting health and weight loss possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #1: My metabolism is slowing down with age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Your metabolism doesn't automatically slow down just because you're getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metabolic rate is tied to body weight, not age," Bikman says. "When people gain weight, their metabolism actually rises. When they lose weight, metabolism falls. The problem isn't age — it's how we're treating our metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real danger is following extreme diets and punishing exercise plans that leave your metabolism broken. TV shows that glorify starvation-style weight loss might deliver dramatic short-term results, but long-term, they wreck your body's natural balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is you can fix your metabolism by eating smarter — balancing proteins, healthy fats, and carbs the right way," Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: freebird7977/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #2: Exercise can erase a bad diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has heard it: "Don't worry, you can just work it off at the gym." But that's a dangerous half-truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is essential. It's great for your heart, brain, hormones and aging well. But as Bikman puts it: "You can't outrun a bad diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A truly tough workout might burn a few hundred calories. That's less than a slice of pizza. And the wrong foods — especially refined carbs and seed oils — don't just resist being burned, they actively trigger fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to rev up your metabolism, your diet is the lever that matters most. "Your diet likely got you where you are," Bikman says. "But it can also change to get you to where you want to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #3: All calories are the same&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, in a chemistry lab, a calorie is a calorie. But in your body, the type of calorie changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would anyone seriously argue that 2,000 calories of soda are equal to 2,000 calories of real, nutrient-dense foods?" Bikman asks. "One drives obesity and disease, the other helps you to thrive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plain truth is, calories interact with your hormones. Insulin, for example, dictates whether you burn calories, store them as fat or waste them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limit carbs, fuel with protein and healthy fats, and you'll enjoy steady energy, sharpen your brain, strengthen your immune system, and actually accelerate your metabolism," Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #4: Low-fat diets are the healthiest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth dates back to 1977, when U.S. government guidelines told Americans to cut fat and eat far more carbohydrates — without legitimate scientific backing. The result? People swapped healthy fats for refined carbs and the outcome has been catastrophic. The average adult is now nearly 30 pounds heavier than average adults in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fats are not the villain," Bikman says. "They're essential. They help you feel full, fuel your brain and support your gut and metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His advice: embrace healthy fats — found in eggs, beef, olive oil, avocado, coconut and more. Ditch harmful seed and vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are essential fatty acids and essential amino acids," Bikman says. "But there's no such thing as an essential carb."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From science to solution: The birth of HLTH Code&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, knowing the truth doesn't always make it easier to eat perfectly. Life gets busy. Stress sneaks in. And that's why Bikman and his team created &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt; — a nutritionally optimized, science-backed shake designed for real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with protein, collagen, probiotics, prebiotic fiber, apple cider vinegar, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats — without added sugar or artificial junk — it's engineered to check every box: weight management, gut health, brain health, energy, and even skin, hair and nail support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes it tastes amazing. "If it didn't, no one would stick with it," Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solving hunger the right way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are "overfed but undernourished." We eat plenty of calories but not the right nutrients, leaving us hungry again an hour later. HLTH Code fixes that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each shake keeps you full for hours, fuels your body with what it actually needs, and costs much less than takeout or fast-food meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Replace one meal a day for wellness, or two if you're serious about weight loss," Bikman recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/reviews/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;five-star reviews&lt;/a&gt; back him up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"These are the best shakes I've ever had — tastes like heaven and keeps me full for hours!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Helped me break a weight loss plateau. Down 21 pounds."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Perfect for my intermittent fasting window. Energy, clarity, results."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why HLTH Code works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy weight loss isn't just about calories—it's about restoring your body's metabolic balance. &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code&lt;/a&gt; helps reset those signals so your body burns fat instead of storing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The science is clear," Bikman says. "When you give your body the right nutrition, everything changes — energy, immunity, brain function, appearance, and yes, weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk-free guarantee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeptical? Bikman gets it. That's why &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code&lt;/a&gt; offers a full satisfaction guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have nothing to lose but the extra pounds — and everything to gain in health, confidence, and vitality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to see the difference?

    &lt;p&gt;Over the past 40 years, Dr. Timothy Lepore has been the emergency room head, sole surgeon and medical examiner on Nantucket, a small island off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Today he runs the only private practice, where he treats dozens of patients with &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/genetically-engineering-mice-to-cut-lyme-disease-transmission-60-minutes-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; each year. About 15% of residents on the island have been afflicted with the disease, which can cause a wide range of symptoms like a fever, rash, facial paralysis, an irregular heartbeat and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lepore, 80, may finally be able to retire if a team of scientists' dream to curb the transmission of Lyme disease on the island becomes a reality. The scientists' target is not the deer or ticks often associated with the disease: it's wild mice, the main host of Lyme bacteria. The hope is that by genetically engineering mice to be immune to Lyme and releasing them in Nantucket, the population of mice able to spread Lyme disease on the island will shrink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why scientists are zeroing in on Nantucket&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem on Nantucket can be traced back to 1926, when the community voted to import two female deer to the island to give a lone buck company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, by the 1950s, half the land on the island was put into conservation. The untamed brush and wild grasslands create an ideal ecosystem for Lyme's hosts to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the deer population grew, so did the population of ticks. Deer don't get Lyme, but female ticks feed on them, and then lay as many as 2,000 eggs in a single batch. Deer also spread the disease as thousands of them carry ticks across Nantucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all ticks carry Lyme disease, and a tick bite doesn't guarantee the transmission. Even if the tick is carrying Lyme, the tick has to be attached for more than 24 hours to infect someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most people associate Lyme disease with deer and ticks, white-footed mice are the main host of Lyme bacteria. When an uninfected tick bites an infected mouse, the bacteria transfer to the tick. When an infected tick then bites an uninfected mouse, the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a problem with tick-borne disease because we engineered the environment to maximize the number of ticks and maximize the number of mice that are the best hosts of Lyme disease," Kevin Esvelt, a genetic engineering pioneer and associate professor at MIT, said. "It came back and bit us, literally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but if left untreated, the infection can spread to the heart, joints and nervous system, as it did for 33-year-old Shauna Asplint, who was first diagnosed with Lyme when she was 10. A few years later, the left side of her face stopped moving, a residual effect from the disease still noticeable today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease afflicts nearly half a million people a year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is rarely fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What scientists are hoping to do &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Esvelt was the first to identify that CRISPR, a technology that allows scientists to modify DNA, could be used to change a species' genetics in perpetuity. His discovery led to Mice Against Ticks, a project run out of Esvelt's Sculpting Evolution lab at MIT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last nine years, he and researcher Joanna Buchthal have looked into whether they could add a gene for an antibody that prevents Lyme disease to a mouse embryo that has progressed into two cells. The lab's technique involves injecting both cells to maximize the likelihood of getting the antibody into the DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injection mix contains both the antibody gene and CRISPR, which acts like molecular scissors. After CRISPR finds and cuts the targeted area of DNA, the cell inserts the antibody gene into the mouse's genetic code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the mouse is born, it will be immune to Lyme disease, and so will its children. The immunization is heritable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed plan is to release thousands of engineered mice on Nantucket over time, starting during the winter months when the native mouse population is low. The immune mice wouldn't spread Lyme to ticks. Therefore, the scientists believe that as the immune population of mice grows, the spread of Lyme disease on the island will slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential consequences for messing with Mother Nature &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists' plan would, essentially, speed up evolution, a process that typically happens very slowly, over thousands or millions of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that's precisely why we have to be careful, because we are doing things that couldn't happen naturally," Esvelt said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esvelt needs the community to agree before he releases genetically engineered mice on Nantucket. Some there have concerns about the potential impact on Mother Nature. Scientists have presented their findings to locals at a series of town halls, which are followed by public Q&amp;amp;A sessions. One resident, who has had Lyme disease twice, thought the mice plan was a "cool" idea, but shared some reservations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mice are kinda the foundation of the food chain. So tinkering with the food chain makes me a little cautious," the resident said during a town hall last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have presented their latest findings to locals 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Telford, Esvelt's collaborator and an epidemiologist at Tufts University who's been studying ticks on Nantucket for the last 40 years, acknowledges that it would be more economical and straightforward to go out and poison the mice on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But then there's a whole food chain that might depend on these mice that would be impacted," Telford said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Timothy Lepore, the physician holding off on retirement, is supportive of the scientists' proposal, but as an avid falconer, he wants more testing done to ensure there won't be unintended consequences to the island's ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If federal and state regulators agree, the team plans to first release the engineered mice in a small field trial on a private island so that they can better understand the ecological impacts before any potential experiments on Nantucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esvelt admits he also worries about the impacts of messing around with Mother Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But, on the other hand, I'm not terribly fond of Mother Nature, if she's gonna give my kids disease," Esvelt said. "All of technology is saying to Mother Nature, 'You're beautiful. And we appreciate you very much and we need to conserve you. But we're not always happy with the way things work, naturally. And so we're going to change it.'"&lt;/p&gt;

on September 20, she described the condition as “abnormal” and “leaky” blood vessels that look like “a raspberry or mulberry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Blood tends to flow through them pretty slowly because they’re in the capillaries of the brain blood vessels and they can occur anywhere in the brain or in the spinal cord,” she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seizures are a telling sign of the disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee goes on to say that the most telling symptoms of cavernous malformation include focal seizures, which affect at least 50 percent of patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-laying-in-a-hospital-bed-in-front-of-a-monitor-jWJdT3chmWQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Getty/Unsplash;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Getty/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These events affect an area of the brain triggering failures in speech and vision and involuntary behaviors in the body while the patient is still conscious. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She further notes that the symptoms experienced by the patient “depends on where the  cavernous malformations are located,” explaining that they can translate into “abnormal body” movements and “weird smells that no one else around [the patient] can smell.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“About fifty percent show up with seizures that are focal seizures, meaning the seizures happening in just a small area of the brain,” Lee elaborated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another sign of Cavernous Malformation is a drooping face &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/alliancetocure/p/Cy3i52IquhN/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alliancetocure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;alliancetocure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Other folks, when they first have a Cavernous Malformation symptom, will have some sort of neurological deficit,” her explanation continued.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It can be face drooping or vision issues, weaknesses, numbness, tingling in arms and legs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Those are not necessarily related to the most severe presentation of CCM (cerebral cavernous malformation), which is hemorrhage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee went on to say Witten Daniel, the little boy who suffered complete paralysis in a matter of hours, fell into the category of CCM patients whose leaking blood vessels become full brain hemorrhages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and infants are more inclined to suffer sudden deteriorations &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/doctor-reading-brain-mri-x-ray-result-Jl_tNv6PEZA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Curated Lifestyle/Getty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Curated Lifestyle/Getty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among kids and infants, the condition more often than not goes undetected until the hemorrhage has progressed, and this is because they have difficulty accurately explaining what they are experiencing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so for little kids, when we get to a point where this becomes emergent, where there’s an emergency, what we see are things like vomiting, projectile vomiting, floppiness, so this loss of muscle tone in infants especially.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And it can be mistaken for something that’s not as severe. The vomiting can be easily mistaken for flu,” Lee says, as a nod to Daniels’ experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explains that although sudden deterioration like Witten’s is rare; it is more common in children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upon experiencing symptoms, individuals should see a doctor or go to an emergency room&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Responding to the question on what action to take at the onset of these symptoms, Lee says that patients “certainly should take themselves to the emergency room to be checked, and that would include face drooping.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That can sometimes just be something as simple as Bell’s palsy, which is not a serious condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It often resolves on its own, but it can also be the sign of something more serious. It’s better to be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The folks who are having focal seizures, that’s not as much of an emergency. You can take that to your regular doctor and then get a referral to neurology for further workup to see if there is some explanation for it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee explains that the most certain way to know is through diagnosis, which usually involves a CT scan and then an MRI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only two percent of Cavernous Malformation patients pass away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortunately, Witten’s sudden deterioration is not the norm, and the suddenness with which debilitates differ from person to person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as harrowing and jarring as the effects may be, only two percent of diagnosed cases result in patients passing away eventually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.utphysicians.com/about-us/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UTHealth Houston;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UTHealth Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By and large, everyone else who has a cavernous malformation will either recover, and most people, even those who have brain hemorrhage, if it’s higher in the brain, frequently have good recovery, even almost back to normal, or if it’s in lower parts of the brain, they continue to have disabilities and deficits,” Lee elaborates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, due to the “higher plasticity” of children’s brains, they have a better chance of making faster and fuller recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The only way to get a sure diagnosis is with an MRI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caseyarend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee’s organisation, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alliance to Cure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.alliancetocure.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:notes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Cavernous Malformation is a rare disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be that as it may, MRIs help with diagnosis with treatment options thereafter being available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So if there is a referral to MRI, the diagnosis is pretty simple and straightforward. To diagnose it works,” Lee observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;But getting a doctor to schedule an MRI can be tricky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So what stands in the way of getting an MRI? Multiple things. First off, the doctor needs to or the health care provider needs to believe you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you’re having neurological symptoms, sometimes they get tossed off as psychiatric symptoms or get attributed to some other physical disease that’s happening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so it may take a while before you actually get to the point where the doctor will say, Oh, there’s something going on in your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/neurologist-issues-warning-about-popular-post-exercise-practice-it-could-trigger-a-stroke/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We should give you an MRI.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and certain “populations” are not favored candidates for MRI’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think particularly there are populations in our country (the US) that don’t get the benefit of the doubt in the same way as others,” Lee observed, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and those folks typically take longer to get a diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A second issue that gets in the way of diagnosis is with kids,” she continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/polygraph-parents-two-young-children-who-suddenly-vanished-revealed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; need to be sedated in order to have an MRI. MRI requires you to lie still for twenty five minutes or more, and children just can’t sustain that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So the sedation itself is a big deal. It requires time in pre op, in the MRI, and then in a recovery area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Witten Daniel is home and well, and planning his return to the baseball field&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a testimony to Lee’s assertions of the low mortality rate surrounding Cavernous Malformation, her daughter and Witten Daniel have made the next best thing to full recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Daniel’s case, it was Casey’s refusal to accept her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/mom-left-puzzled-after-toddler-complains-of-hearing-ultrasound-photo-too-loud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:son;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;son&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s fate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following a Google search, she connected with neurosurgeons Dr. Manish Shah and Dr. Jacques Morcos at Houston’s UTHealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of this interaction, her son, now seven, is home again, preparing to return to the baseball field, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2025/09/12/lubbock-mother-says-google-search-saved-her-sons-life/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;per&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;KCBD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears the internet rallied behind Witten Daniels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 22:31:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9fV0MwY2loUDF4Y0JwNFVPaXpNa0tJNmlrd3paQTRYS3A5UFVFaHc4UEhzRkhncm5TUi1PaU5DUl9Oay1UY1Q2cUFVMTdfb2FNYVlqX2oxQ245aFZpdXM5aW5IN21LVlNBZGQ5S3lRMlNVcC1SOHJFQ2UyRQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现一种可以阻止骨质疏松症的开关，使老年人的骨骼更强壮-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scientists-find-a-switch-that-could-stop-osteoporosis-making-bones-stronger-in-old-age/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a high demand for safe and long-lasting medications to treat bone loss for the millions of people with osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovering new targets for drug development is therefore a key step towards better therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, scientists at Leipzig University in Germany demonstrated that the G protein receptor called GPR133 plays a central role in building and maintaining healthy bone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If this receptor is impaired by genetic changes, mice show signs of loss of bone density at an early age—similar to osteoporosis in humans,” explains Professor Ines Liebscher, lead investigator of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02291-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the study published&lt;/a&gt; in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was able to significantly increase bone strength in both healthy and osteoporotic mice using the substance AP503, which was recently identified as a stimulator of GPR133.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In bone tissue, GPR133 is activated through the interaction of neighboring bone cells and mechanical strain. This triggers a signal that stimulates bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) and inhibits bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is stronger, more resilient bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, it could be used both to further strengthen healthy bones and to rebuild weakened ones—for instance, in cases of osteoporosis in women going through menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧬 Scientists leverage &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; to rapidly create &lt;strong&gt;personalized immune therapies&lt;/strong&gt; for cancer treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⚗️ Innovative AI designs &lt;strong&gt;minibinder proteins&lt;/strong&gt; that train the immune system to target cancer cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔍 Virtual safety checks enhance therapy &lt;strong&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; by preventing attacks on healthy cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏳ New method promises &lt;strong&gt;faster&lt;/strong&gt; and more &lt;strong&gt;precise&lt;/strong&gt; cancer treatments, transforming oncology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of cancer treatment is witnessing a revolutionary shift with the introduction of AI-driven methods to create personalized immune therapies rapidly. This groundbreaking approach utilizes artificial intelligence to design proteins that can effectively train the immune system to target cancer cells. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on finding natural immune matches—a process that can take years—this new technique accelerates the timeline significantly. Within just weeks, scientists can create synthetic proteins that direct immune cells to cancer targets, marking a significant advancement in cancer research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Faster Way to Train the Immune System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; highlights a significant leap forward in cancer treatment. Researchers from the Technical University of Denmark and the Scripps Research Institute have developed an AI platform to target cancer proteins, such as NY-ESO-1. This protein, prevalent in numerous tumors, has been a focal point for activating immune responses. By leveraging AI, scientists designed a minibinder protein that attaches to the NY-ESO-1 structure, enhancing the immune system’s ability to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process involved inserting the AI-designed protein into immune cells, resulting in modified cells known as IMPAC-T cells. These cells demonstrated a robust capacity to identify and eliminate cancer cells marked by NY-ESO-1. The success of these laboratory experiments underscores the potential of AI in creating highly effective cancer-targeting therapies. As Kristoffer Haurum Johansen, a postdoctoral researcher involved in the study, noted, the AI-generated minibinders performed impressively well in laboratory settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fighting Cancer With Digital Blueprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative AI system extends beyond known cancer targets, offering a new avenue for precision medicine. Researchers tested the platform on a previously unmapped target from a metastatic melanoma patient. The system successfully generated minibinders for this novel target, demonstrating its potential to design therapies for previously untargetable cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XLwz0TcFeQ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/theyre-hijacking-nature-with-machines-this-quantum-gamble-in-denmark-fuels-global-tensions-over-microsofts-power-and-national-resistance/"&gt;“They’re Hijacking Nature with Machines”: This Quantum Gamble in Denmark Fuels Global Tensions Over Microsoft’s Power and National Resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This capability represents a transformative step in cancer treatment, enabling the creation of therapies tailored to the unique cancer markers in each patient. By utilizing digital models, scientists can bypass the limitations of existing data and immune cell availability. According to Timothy P. Jenkins, associate professor at DTU, the platform essentially provides a new set of tools for the immune system, designing molecular keys to target cancer cells with remarkable speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Screening to Improve Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of developing new immune therapies is ensuring they do not inadvertently attack healthy cells. Cancer markers often resemble proteins found in normal tissues, posing a risk of severe side effects if therapies bind to the wrong targets. To mitigate this risk, the research team implemented a "virtual safety check."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Precision in cancer treatment is crucial,” said Sine Reker Hadrup, professor at DTU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/i-just-saw-impossible-scientists-prove-time-reflections-exist-leaving-experts-stunned-and-forcing-physics-to-rewrite-its-own-laws/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using computer simulations, the team tested each minibinder against a comprehensive range of pMHCs present on healthy cells. This preemptive screening allowed them to eliminate potentially harmful designs before reaching the lab testing phase. By predicting and ruling out cross-reactions during the design phase, researchers increased the likelihood of developing safe and effective therapies. This step is pivotal in ensuring the safe application of these treatments in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Bench to Bedside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lab results are promising, the journey from research to clinical application requires careful navigation. Jenkins estimates that it will take approximately five years before initiating clinical trials in humans. Once these trials commence, the treatment protocol will likely resemble existing methods used for certain blood cancers, involving the collection and modification of a patient’s immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the new AI method promises to streamline and personalize the process. By utilizing digital tools to design a perfect match for each patient's tumor markers, the approach could revolutionize treatments for solid tumors, where current immune therapies have had limited success. This advancement paves the way for potentially treating cancers previously deemed untreatable and exploring rare or unique mutations overlooked by conventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5LVxn9Sbff"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/09/students-build-rocket-engine-in-9-months-swiss-undergraduates-create-revolutionary-3d-printer-that-fuses-two-different-metals-simultaneously-while-cutting-production-time-by-67-percent/"&gt;“Students Build Rocket Engine In 9 Months”: Swiss Undergraduates Create Revolutionary 3D Printer That Fuses Two Different Metals Simultaneously While Cutting Production Time By 67 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Era in Precision Oncology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capability to design cancer-targeting proteins from scratch marks a pivotal moment in immunotherapy. This breakthrough illustrates the feasibility of transitioning from a digital blueprint to a functional immune therapy within a matter of weeks. The synthetic minibinders developed by the research team function comparably to natural receptors, effectively guiding T cells to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tested in laboratory settings, these engineered immune cells demonstrated comparable efficacy to those created through traditional methods, yet with faster and safer development processes. With ongoing refinement, AI-powered approaches could make personalized cancer treatments more accessible, precise, and swiftly deliverable. The future of immunotherapy is evolving beyond biological understanding to include the design of solutions through digital innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the integration of AI in cancer treatment progresses, it raises important questions about the future of precision medicine. How will these advancements shape the landscape of oncology and patient care in the coming years?&lt;/p&gt;

Compared with AlphaFold2, AF3 consistently generated more accurate structural predictions when benchmarked against experimentally determined data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed strong structural similarities in intracellular regions of T2Rs, with significant variation in extracellular regions, explaining how different receptors respond to diverse bitter compounds. These insights highlight T2Rs’ dual roles in taste and gut-brain signaling, opening pathways for research on appetite control, glucose metabolism, and lifestyle diseases such as diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Upgrade:&lt;/strong&gt; AlphaFold3 outperformed AlphaFold2 in predicting T2R structures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Intracellular regions were highly conserved, while extracellular regions varied widely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings link bitter receptors to gut-brain signaling and possible diabetes research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Shibaura Institute of Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receptor proteins, expressed on the cell surface or within the cell, bind to different signaling molecules, known as ligands, initiating cellular responses. Taste receptors, expressed in oral tissues, interact with tastants, the molecules responsible for the sensation of taste. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are responsible for the sensation of bitter taste. However, apart from oral tissue, these receptors are also expressed in the neuropod cells of the gastrointestinal tract, which are responsible for transmitting signals from the gut to the brain. Thus, T2Rs might play a crucial role in maintaining the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;25 types of human T2Rs have been identified to date. However, due to certain complexities, the structure of most of these receptors is not yet elucidated. In recent times, AI-based prediction models have been used to understand protein structure accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, a Nobel Prize-winning artificial intelligence (AI)-based model, AlphaFold2 (AF2), was utilized to decipher the structures of T2Rs. However, with the advancement in technology, the model has been updated to its latest version, AlphaFold3 (AF3). The latest model allows a more detailed structural prediction compared to the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, in this study, a group of researchers, led by Professor Naomi Osakabe from Shibaura Institute of Technology, decided to analyze the structure of T2Rs using the AF3 model and compare the accuracy with the results from the AF2-based prediction study and the available three-dimensional structures of the two T2Rs, T2R14 and T2R46. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The expression of bitter taste receptors in the gastrointestinal tract indicates that they are involved in maintaining the gut-brain axis, glucose tolerance, and appetite regulation. Hence, understanding the structure can provide a better insight into its function,” mentioned Prof. Osakabe as the main motivation behind this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper was made available online on July 14, 2025, and was published in Volume 11 of the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Research in Food Science&lt;/em&gt; on July 22, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article has been co-authored by Takafumi Shimizu and Rio Ohno, from Shibaura Institute of Technology, and Professor Vittorio Calabrese, from the University of Catania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers obtained the amino acid sequences of all human T2Rs from the UniProt database and used the AF3 model to predict their three-dimensional structures. For comparison, previously generated AF2 prediction data were retrieved from the AlphaFold database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimentally determined structures of T2R14 and T2R46 were sourced from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Various software tools were employed for structure visualization, alignment, and accuracy assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that AF3 provided consistently more accurate structural predictions than AF2. For T2R14, predictions were benchmarked against 115 cryo-EM structures, and AF3 showed the higher agreement with experimental data. Similarly, for T2R46, comparisons with three experimentally resolved structures confirmed that AF3 achieved the closest match in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarities in the structure of the T2Rs were also analyzed for this study. For these receptors, part of the protein remains inside the cell, known as the intracellular region, while another part stays outside the cell (extracellular region). The interaction with signal molecules happens in the extracellular region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrated that there are more structural similarities and consistencies among the intracellular regions of the T2Rs. The extracellular region of the receptors shows significant structural variation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clustering of proteins is based on their structural similarity and dissimilarity. Based on our findings, we divided the T2Rs into three different clusters,” states Prof. Osakabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns may help researchers understand how different T2Rs function and why certain receptors respond to specific compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure of T2Rs probably allows them to recognize the thousands of different bitter substances via interaction with another taste receptor-specific G protein, α-gustducin&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the receptors’ involvement in detecting bitter tastants and maintaining the gut-brain axis, this can play an important role in health and pharmaceutical-based research, specifically targeting lifestyle diseases like diabetes,” mentioned Prof. Osakabe, explaining the importance of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research, focusing on the relation between sequence and structure of the T2Rs and how individual perception of taste varies, will help in a more comprehensive understanding of T2R function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding Information&lt;/strong&gt;: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number: 23H02166).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#acc7c3c4c3ecc3db82dfc4c5cecdd9decd81c5d882cdcf82c6dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kohei Tsuchiya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://shibaura-it.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shibaura Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kohei Tsuchiya – Shibaura Institute of Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2025.101146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The three-dimensional structure prediction of human bitter taste receptor using the method of AlphaFold3&lt;/a&gt;” by Naomi Osakabe et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Research in Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The three-dimensional structure prediction of human bitter taste receptor using the method of AlphaFold3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs), a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, are expressed not only in oral tissues but also in extraoral sites, playing key roles in physiological processes such as the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, structural information on T2Rs is limited, with only two human T2Rs, T2R14 and T2R46, experimentally determined to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study explores the potential of AlphaFold3 (AF3), an advanced AI-based protein structure prediction tool, to predict the structures of 25 human T2Rs and compares them with those of the earlier AlphaFold2 (AF2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of AF3 was evaluated by comparing the predicted structures of T2R14 and T2R46 with known experimental structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that AF3 provides more accurate structural predictions than AF2 for these receptors, though the predicted local distance difference test scores for AF3 were unexpectedly lower across all T2R subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent analysis indicated that significant structural variations were observed in the receptor’s extracellular region, in contrast to a higher degree of structural consistency in the intracellular region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clustering based on sequence identity and root mean square deviation highlighted distinct groupings among the receptors. The structural properties of these T2Rs may be related to their ability to recognize thousands of diverse bitter substances through interaction with the taste receptor-specific G protein, α-gustducin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study provides evidence that AF3 can advance our understanding of T2R structure and research into the biological activity of T2R-ligand interactions in health-related processes, including risk reduction of obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 19:45:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFA3WW9hLUo3Q1ZNbTRTTlV6NGk4UlZ2dUpNUmM1aXZxdGROUnVxQ1lLclFyQUQ0RmxEekt4eTZTQ0M5U0JMQnN0UDFodHFadl83QTZXck9BUC1SaHFuRWpwWE1XT3RJNENXZUU4WjY4MjBBZw</guid></item><item><title>青少年在将严重疾病误认为流感后截肢： “我的脚是绿色的” - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/teenager-legs-fingers-amputated-mistaking-165142176.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketia Moponda / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Ketia Moponda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketia Moponda had to get her legs and fingers amputated in life-saving operations after mistaking a serious illness for freshers’ flu a few months earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 19-year-old college student was found unconscious in her dorm room and transported to the ICU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda was diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia, which caused bacterial meningitis and led to sepsis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A college student had to get her legs and fingers amputated in life-saving operations after mistaking a serious illness for freshers’ flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight days after Ketia Moponda arrived at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, in September 2024, she started feeling sick, per SWNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 19-year-old didn’t take immediate action because she believed her symptoms – which started with just a cough – were caused by the freshers’ flu, which often affects students at the beginning of a school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketia Moponda / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Ketia Moponda&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalled feeling drowsy one evening at dinner, so she took medicine and went to bed. When she woke up the next day, she felt worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda called her cousin and best friend throughout the day, telling the latter that she felt like she was “going to die.” When she didn’t check in the next day, her friend contacted the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marketing and advertising student was found unconscious in her dorm room and transported to the ICU at Leicester Royal Infirmary hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketia Moponda / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Ketia Moponda in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda was diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia. The serious bacterial infection caused bacterial meningitis, which led to sepsis. The college freshman underwent amputations to her fingers and both legs in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningococcal disease, per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22442-meningococcal-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, is a bacterial infection that can be spread through spit or mucus. The illness can infect your meninges, which are the membranes that cover one’s brain and spinal cord, and blood. Some survivors have long-term complications, including brain damage, kidney damage, loss of limbs and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda, who wants to share her story to caution other students, said, “I have no memory of any of this, but I’m lucky to be alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student explained that when she arrived at the hospital, her blood oxygen level was at 1% and her blood wasn’t properly circulating through her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My feet were green and swollen,” she said. "My organs were failing, and doctors told my family that if I woke at all I'd likely be brain dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketia Moponda / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Ketia Moponda’s amputated legs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, Moponda was put into a coma and woke up two days later. She recalled that she “couldn’t see or speak and it was a whole week before I started speaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her treatment, the skin on her fingers and feet became swollen and painful because of the lack of blood flow. She also caught a flesh-eating infection on her buttocks, which was addressed with a skin graft from her thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fingers were amputated at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham in December. Both of her legs were amputated right below the knee the following month.  "Basically my legs had died because of a lack of blood going to them," she said. "It was terrible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just kept crying all the time. I felt so hurt, it was killing my spirit," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moponda, who lived an active lifestyle and had aspirations to be a model, said she "just cried" when she woke up from the operation.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;paralyzed &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;hours later—because of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rare brain disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; that makes cells bleed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The boy, a little league MVP, lost his ability to walk, talk, and even breathe independently in 24 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors then realized that the child had a cavernoma—a mulberry-like cluster of leaking cells near his brain stem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

signs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prognosis was dark: Casey heard that due to the condition that affects 1 in every 2,000 people, her boy would likely never walk again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;In another case, a pediatrician thought it was an earache &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block"

and prescribed amoxicillin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;An MRI showed that Connie Lee’s daughter had multiple tumors on her brain &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Lee

September 20, she described the condition as “abnormal” and “leaky” blood vessels that look like “a raspberry or mulberry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Blood tends to flow through them pretty slowly because they’re in the capillaries of the brain blood vessels and they can occur anywhere in the brain or in the spinal cord,” she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seizures are a telling sign of the disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lee goes on to say that the most telling symptoms of cavernous

and this is because they have difficulty accurately explaining what they are experiencing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so for little kids, when we get to a point where this becomes emergent, where there’s an emergency, what we see are things like vomiting, projectile vomiting, floppiness, so this loss of muscle tone in infants especially.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And it can be mistaken for something that’s not as severe. The vomiting can be easily mistaken for flu,” Lee says, as a nod to Daniels’ experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="3-68d04286b72a0__700" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/6-yo-lost-ability-to-walk-talk-and-breathe-docs-couldnt-help-but-google-saved-his-life/?image_id=3-68d04286b72a0__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Mom’s Google Search Saved Her 6YO Boy When Doctors Couldn’t Explain His Collapse, Expert Weighs In" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/6-yo-lost-ability-to-walk-talk-and-breathe-docs-couldnt-help-but-google-saved-his-life/?media_id=3-68d04286b72a0__700" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3-68d04286b72a0__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3-68d04286b72a0__700.jpg" alt="Mom’s Google Search Saved Her 6YO Boy When Doctors Couldn’t Explain His Collapse, Expert Weighs In" title="Mom’s Google Search Saved Her 6YO Boy When Doctors Couldn’t Explain His Collapse, Expert Weighs In" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explains that although sudden deterioration like Witten’s is rare; it is more common in children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upon experiencing symptoms, individuals should see a doctor or go to an emergency room&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Responding to the question on what action to take at the onset of these symptoms, Lee says that patients “certainly should take themselves to the emergency room to be checked, and that would include face drooping.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="4-68d042852954a__700" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/6-yo-lost-ability-to-walk-talk-and-breathe-docs-couldnt-help-but-google-saved-his-life/?image_id=4-68d042852954a__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Mom’s Google Search Saved Her 6YO Boy When Doctors Couldn’t Explain His Collapse, Expert Weighs In" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/6-yo-lost-ability-to-walk-talk-and-breathe-docs-couldnt-help-but-google-saved-his-life/?media_id=4-68d042852954a__700" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4-68d042852954a__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4-68d042852954a__700.jpg" alt="Mom’s Google Search Saved Her 6YO Boy When Doctors Couldn’t Explain His Collapse, Expert Weighs In" title="Mom’s Google Search Saved Her 6YO Boy When Doctors Couldn’t Explain His Collapse, Expert Weighs In" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caseyarend" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;caseyarend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That can sometimes just be something as simple as Bell’s palsy, which is not a serious condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It often resolves on its own, but it can also be the sign of something more serious. It’s better to be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The folks who are having focal seizures, that’s not as much of an emergency.

from person to person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as harrowing and jarring as the effects may be, only two percent of diagnosed cases result in patients passing away

Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By and large, everyone else who has a cavernous malformation will either recover, and most people, even those who have brain hemorrhage, if it’s higher in the brain, frequently have good recovery, even almost back to normal, or if it’s in lower parts of the brain, they continue to have disabilities and deficits,” Lee elaborates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, due to the “higher plasticity” of children’s brains, they have a better chance of making faster and fuller recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The only way to get a sure diagnosis is with an MRI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block"

disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be that as it may, MRIs help with diagnosis with treatment options thereafter being available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So if there is a referral to MRI, the diagnosis is pretty simple and straightforward. To diagnose it works,” Lee observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;But getting a doctor to schedule an MRI can be tricky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So what stands in the way of getting an MRI? Multiple things. First off, the doctor needs to or the health care provider needs to believe you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you’re having neurological symptoms, sometimes they get tossed off as psychiatric symptoms or get attributed to some other physical disease that’s happening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so it may take a while before you actually get to the point where the doctor will say, Oh, there’s something going on in your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/neurologist-issues-warning-about-popular-post-exercise-practice-it-could-trigger-a-stroke/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We should give you an MRI.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and certain “populations” are not favored candidates for MRI’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think particularly there are populations in our country (the US) that don’t get the benefit of the doubt in the same way as others,” Lee observed, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and those folks typically take longer to get a diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A second issue that gets in the way of diagnosis is with kids,” she continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/polygraph-parents-two-young-children-who-suddenly-vanished-revealed/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; need to be sedated in order to have an MRI. MRI requires you to lie still for twenty five minutes or more, and children just can’t sustain that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So the sedation itself is a big deal. It requires time in pre op, in the MRI, and then in a recovery area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Witten Daniel is home and well, and planning his return to the baseball field&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a testimony to Lee’s assertions of the low mortality rate surrounding Cavernous Malformation, her daughter and Witten Daniel have made the next best thing to full recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Daniel’s case, it was Casey’s refusal to accept her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/mom-left-puzzled-after-toddler-complains-of-hearing-ultrasound-photo-too-loud/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;son&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s fate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following a Google search, she connected with neurosurgeons Dr. Manish Shah and Dr. Jacques Morcos at Houston’s UTHealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of this interaction, her son, now seven, is home again, preparing to return to the baseball field, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2025/09/12/lubbock-mother-says-google-search-saved-her-sons-life/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;per&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;KCBD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears the internet rallied behind Witten Daniels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9370777" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9370777" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="16907"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9370777-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Dr Louisa Messenger, an environment and global health expert in Nevada, warned that her state had considered ramping up mosquito control efforts this year amid an explosion in its population of the biting insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost everyone gets bitten by mosquitoes, with experts saying it is likely that more than a hundred million bites take place in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of these bites only result in a raised red bump for a few days, which may be itchy or become inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in a number of cases the mosquito has transferred an infectious disease to the individual that can quickly trigger symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman added: 'If a child has had a recent mosquito bite and their behavior has changed or they have a rash, those are the sorts of things that their physician should look at.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid mosquito bites and the potential danger the pose, Daily Mail has rounded up expert-backed tips to keep you safe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;REPELLENT &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are dozens of brands of mosquito repellent available in the US that can be sprayed onto the skin to ward off a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Nachman said she advises her patients to use ones that contain DEET, an active ingredient that can prevent bites from both ticks and mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For children, she recommended applying it to their clothes as opposed to their skin, saying this avoids it accidentally coming off during play or if children get wet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For adults, she said the spray should be applied to any exposed areas of skin that could be vulnerable to a bite such as the neck, face, arms, legs and ankles. It is recommended to reapply the repellent every few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger said using DEET, picardin or IR3535-laced sprays could effectively ward off mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The repellents work by &lt;span&gt;obscuring the natural odor of the human body, that attracts mosquitoes, or repelling them on contact with the skin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquitoes have taste receptors in their feet, which are repelled by substances like DEET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommended applying the sprays at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger added: 'I am often asked whether it is essential to use the chemicals because people don't like the fact they are sticky, stay on clothing, and they don't always want to put a harsh chemical on their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But studies show that these chemicals are safe for human use and work. While there is some evidence that eating cinnamon, garlic or lavender rosemary may work, I can't recommend these because they are not EPA-approved.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another repellent to prevent mosquito bites are burning coils, which contain chemicals like pyrethrins. These are released into the air to repel mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, experts said the best way to avoid bites without using repellent is wearing long-sleeved clothing that covers the arms and legs, a common target for mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;ZAPPERS AND TRAPPERS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people love to take a few moments outdoors to have dinner or read a book at dusk, which is also a peak time for mosquito activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zappers can help, though. They use ultraviolet light to attract mosquitoes before killing them with an electric shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traps may also be an option, which use human-like pheromones to attract mosquitoes before ensnaring them before they can land on a human and bite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These should be placed under bushes or near water sources, experts say, while zappers can be placed near where people gather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger said: 'These can be effective, but it does depend on your local mosquito population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These traps will catch a few of the mosquitoes, but won't get everything, so it is likely you will still have some mosquitoes on your patio.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;TOPICAL PRODUCTS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For some people, dousing themselves in mosquito-repellent spray can feel arduous or even uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In these cases, manufacturers have come up with alternative ways to apply mosquito repellent to the skin, including via a lotion or using mosquito repellent wipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recommend applying these products to the same exposed areas of skin as spray-on repellent to ward off mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman said it was not clear how long these products would be effective, saying they could leave someone needing to continuously reapply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This all sounds well and good,' she said, 'but while it will work for a short time, whether it will work for longer is doubtful'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messenger said: 'Over-the-counter lotions and wipes can be effective, and applying mosquito repellent to your skin is one of the best things you can do to avoid being bitten.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;HOME CARE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also many steps people can take at home to reduce their exposure to mosquitoes and their risk of being bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the top of Dr Nachman's list was emptying any containers near the home that contain stagnant water, which is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stagnant water is a wonderful place for mosquitoes to bloom,' she said, 'if you have any, dump it out, it will reduce the mosquito population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that mosquitoes can breed in very small amounts of water, such as the equivalent to a bottlecap or tablespoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other suggestions include having net screens on the door or windows that are often open in the dusk or early morning to stop a mosquito from entering the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also say turning on the air conditioning in the evening can help, saying that the dry and cooler air causes any mosquitoes already in the house to become much less active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 18:38:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNYVJLSnRva05YRzZmX3d0b0d4MDZ3eEVucUFIQmdxRUh0aW9icG9yZXc3Y01SNC1sWGhfYWUtazZSSEk4aXVOaWxQS2k1OW5mM3pmRjUzazEzc3JsY2ZYR200dXdDUjBYWklBSnhFd2ZaRmtOMzFiSzRUa2pTR1V3aEZxWnh3dlhS0gGOAUFVX3lxTFBFdVZFNzBfbE53a2QzVlc1dUc2TkVTLXd0WTdhTVcyaTVlRkwxLXh1bnVvWHdaNHhTQk5reWlETFFNTEZOYm0zaldibzFwXzdDTm5vNHZJdW5sNGphY1RYUm9HWV9xVGJ5d3BONWNValVUdHFkVXRsQ09pZjc0V1cteXZjYzNYWUZVeGFwMXc</guid></item><item><title>一些习惯可以使人们对蚊子更具吸引力- upi.com</title><link>https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/09/21/mosquito-bites-human-habits/5591758479140/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="stph_caption"&gt;Habits such as beer or cannabis consumption, or sleeping next to somebody the night before, make people more attractive to mosquitoes, according to a study.

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the Netherlands turned a major music festival into an unexpected laboratory to investigate a question that has long puzzled scientists and bug-bitten individuals alike: What makes some people more irresistible to mosquitoes than others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three consecutive days at the Lowlands festival in Biddinghuizen, Netherlands, scientists set up a unique pop-up research site inside a series of shipping container laboratories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of waiting for their favorite band, hundreds of festivalgoers lined up to volunteer for the "Mosquito Magnet Trial," a study designed to measure their personal attractiveness to the insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the make-shift lab from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day, groups of participants rested their arms against transparent acrylic boxes that had caged mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the insects responded to the human scent, a camera and computer system recorded mosquito movements and calculated a unique attraction score for each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, which included over 500 volunteers, yielded a wide range of results, with some people sending mosquitoes scurrying to a sugar feeder while others became instant magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's findings, published in a preliminary report at bioRxiv.org, reveal some surprising links between certain habits and mosquito attraction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that festival attendees who had recently consumed beer were 44% more attractive to mosquitoes than people who didn't, and recent cannabis users were also significantly more appealing to the insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who had slept in close proximity to another person the previous night also registered a higher attraction score to the mighty little biters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the team did find a simple way to fend off the tiny bloodsuckers. People who had applied sunscreen were about half as attractive to the mosquitoes as those who had not, suggesting a potential deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Felix Hol, a quantitative biologist who led the study at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, Netherlands, the public's eagerness to participate was a highlight of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You'd hear loud cheers when a score popped up on the scoreboard," Hol said in a news release, reflecting on the lively atmosphere. "I was really completely overwhelmed by the enthusiasm for the project and for science in general."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hol cautioned that the findings should be interpreted with care, given the study's unconventional setting and the specific population of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a traditional, highly-controlled lab environment, the festival's conditions introduced many variables. The researchers also noted that the study population -- mostly young, camping-enthused attendees -- may not be representative of the general public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers a fun and enlightening look at mosquito behavior and what might make people more or less susceptible to bites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that if you don't want to attract mosquitoes, "don't drink beer, don't smoke weed, don't sleep with people and put on your sunscreen," Hol said in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, "You can do whatever you want and put on long sleeves," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="368" data-end="522"&gt;We spend so much time thinking about skincare routines, workout programs, and nutrition hacks to slow down aging. But posture? It rarely makes the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="524" data-end="880"&gt;The reality is that how you carry yourself can add or subtract years from your appearance. Physical therapists will tell you that posture doesn’t just affect how your body feels—it changes how others see you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="524" data-end="880"&gt;Rounded shoulders, forward necks, stiff knees… they all create the impression of being older, more tired, and less energized than you really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="882" data-end="1037"&gt;The good news is that these patterns aren’t set in stone. With awareness and small tweaks, you can make your posture work for you instead of against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1039" data-end="1153"&gt;Here are seven common posture mistakes that silently age you—and what physical therapists recommend to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1160" data-end="1187"&gt;1. Slouching shoulders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1189" data-end="1373"&gt;Think about the last time you saw someone sitting in a café, shoulders rounded forward, spine collapsed into the chair. What did it say about them? Probably not “vital and youthful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1375" data-end="1578"&gt;When your shoulders slump, your chest caves in and your upper back curves unnaturally. Not only does this contribute to chronic back pain, but it also projects the look of someone weighed down by life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1580" data-end="1767"&gt;Physical therapists often start with a simple cue: roll your shoulders back and down, as if you’re gently putting them in your back pockets. This opens the chest and realigns the spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1769" data-end="2038"&gt;I’ve noticed this in my own life while editing photos for long stretches. I’ll get up and realize I’ve been sitting like a question mark. Just five minutes of doorway stretches—placing my forearms on each side of the frame and leaning forward—undoes hours of tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2040" data-end="2205"&gt;Slouching is more than a bad habit. It’s a visual signal that you’re carrying the weight of the world. Straightening up flips that signal into strength and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2212" data-end="2237"&gt;2. Forward head tilt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2239" data-end="2273"&gt;“Text neck” is the new bad back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2275" data-end="2541"&gt;As Dr. Scott Bautch, a past president of the American Chiropractic Association’s Council on Occupational Health, has explained, “Your head weighs around 10–12 pounds, but every inch it tilts forward &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/what-is-text-neck?.com"&gt;adds significant pressure to your neck&lt;/a&gt;—up to 60 pounds of force.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2543" data-end="2703"&gt;No wonder it ages your appearance. A head jutting forward not only strains muscles but creates that tired, stooped look we often associate with getting older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2705" data-end="2897"&gt;The correction? Bring screens to eye level, practice chin tucks (pulling your chin gently back without tilting the head up or down), and check your posture every time you pick up your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3119"&gt;I started keeping my laptop on a stack of books during writing sessions, and the difference was night and day. My neck no longer felt stiff at the end of the day, and my profile in photos looked more upright and alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3121" data-end="3197"&gt;A small adjustment in head position instantly takes years off your stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3204" data-end="3224"&gt;3. Locked knees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3226" data-end="3311"&gt;Here’s a posture mistake most people never think about: standing with knees locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3313" data-end="3528"&gt;When you push your knees all the way back, you’re essentially jamming your joints and making your legs look stiff. It doesn’t just feel unnatural—it also adds an awkward, rigid quality to your whole body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3530" data-end="3727"&gt;Physical therapists encourage a &lt;a href="https://improveworkspace.com/should-my-knees-be-locked-or-slightly-bent-using-standing-desk/?.com"&gt;“soft bend.”&lt;/a&gt; Not exaggerated, just enough so your legs look dynamic instead of frozen. This distributes weight through your muscles instead of straining ligaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3729" data-end="4000"&gt;I picked this up while traveling in Tokyo. Watching commuters stand on crowded platforms, I noticed their knees weren’t rigid. They looked relaxed, balanced, and—despite the chaos around them—comfortable. It made me rethink the way I stand in line at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4002" data-end="4168"&gt;Want to try it? Next time you’re standing still, unlock your knees slightly and shift your weight gently between feet. You’ll not only feel younger, you’ll look it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4175" data-end="4209"&gt;4. Uneven weight distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4211" data-end="4363"&gt;Do you always lean on one hip while standing? Cross your legs the same way every time? Maybe you shift your weight into one side without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4365" data-end="4541"&gt;These habits build up asymmetry. Your muscles adapt unevenly, one side gets tighter, and eventually your whole stance tilts. Visually, it gives you a lopsided, fatigued look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4543" data-end="4705"&gt;As noted by physical therapist Dr. Vinh Pham, “Posture is not just about appearance—it’s about symmetry. When the body is balanced, it looks and feels younger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4707" data-end="4944"&gt;One simple fix is to check your feet. Are they carrying equal weight? Stand tall, spread your weight evenly, and imagine a string pulling you upward from the crown of your head. Suddenly your stance projects balance instead of fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4946" data-end="5178"&gt;For me, this clicked during long photography sessions. I’d catch myself leaning on one hip while holding the camera. Once I learned to center my weight, I not only looked steadier, but my shots improved because my body was stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5185" data-end="5211"&gt;5. Rounded upper back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5213" data-end="5364"&gt;This one is practically the poster child of “looking older.” The rounded, hunched upper back—sometimes called &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/kyphosis-exercises?.com"&gt;kyphosis&lt;/a&gt;—isn’t limited to older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5366" data-end="5615"&gt;Desk jobs, laptop living, and endless hours of scrolling are giving younger people the same posture pattern. Once the thoracic spine curves forward, everything follows: the head juts out, the shoulders close in, and your presence looks diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5617" data-end="5867"&gt;The antidote? Extension exercises. Physical therapists recommend lying over a foam roller at mid-back level and gently arching backward, or strengthening the rhomboids (the muscles between your shoulder blades) with simple rows or band pull-aparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5869" data-end="6134"&gt;I’ve mentioned this in another post, but strength training in this area completely changed how I carry myself. Adding just a few sets of rows each week made my upper back feel sturdier—and people around me noticed I “look taller,” even though I’m the same height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6141" data-end="6163"&gt;6. Dropped pelvis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6165" data-end="6218"&gt;Your pelvis is the hidden puppet master of posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6220" data-end="6446"&gt;If it tilts forward too much, you develop swayback—your lower back curves excessively, and your stomach sticks out more than it should. Tilt it backward, and your lower spine flattens, creating a rigid, older-looking stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6448" data-end="6538"&gt;Both positions throw off your alignment, and both silently add years to your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6540" data-end="6782"&gt;Physical therapists often coach clients to find &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article-abstract/64/4/510/2727727?&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;“neutral pelvis.”&lt;/a&gt; Imagine your pelvis as a bowl of water: tilt too far forward and it spills out the front; tilt too far back and it spills out the back. Neutral is when the water stays level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6784" data-end="7004"&gt;For me, yoga was the game changer. Moves like bridge pose and cat-cow helped me feel the difference between forward, backward, and neutral tilt. Once I learned that awareness, I could adjust it instantly in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7006" data-end="7113"&gt;Getting the pelvis right doesn’t just protect your spine—it makes your entire posture look more youthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7120" data-end="7142"&gt;7. Shuffling gait&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7144" data-end="7203"&gt;Walking posture is just as important as standing posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7205" data-end="7424"&gt;A shuffling gait—short steps, little arm swing, eyes down—is one of the clearest signals of aging. But here’s the thing: it usually has nothing to do with age. More often it’s tight hips, weak glutes, or stiff ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7426" data-end="7649"&gt;Physical therapists recommend loosening up the hips with stretches, strengthening glutes with simple bridges or lunges, and consciously lengthening your stride. Even swinging your arms naturally as you walk adds vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7651" data-end="7931"&gt;I had to relearn this after spraining an ankle years ago. I found myself taking tiny steps out of caution, and the habit stuck. Once I did mobility work and got comfortable again, I noticed my walk regained a kind of bounce. Friends commented that I seemed “lighter on my feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7933" data-end="8036"&gt;That’s the magic of fixing gait—it doesn’t just change how you move, it changes how you’re perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8043" data-end="8063"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8065" data-end="8261"&gt;Posture is a silent language. It tells the world whether you’re energetic or weary, youthful or weighed down. And unlike skin creams or expensive treatments, it’s completely within your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8263" data-end="8498"&gt;Every one of these mistakes—slouching shoulders, forward head tilt, locked knees, uneven weight, rounded upper back, dropped pelvis, and shuffling gait—ages you unnecessarily. But each has a fix that doesn’t require hours at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8500" data-end="8637"&gt;Roll your shoulders back. Lift your head. Unlock your knees. Stand evenly. Open your upper back. Balance your pelvis. Walk with energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8639" data-end="8768"&gt;They’re small adjustments, but together they send a powerful message: I’m vibrant, I’m present, and I’m younger than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four schools in Hidalgo County are reporting cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a virus that's common in children and spreads easily through touch. So far, health officials say there are 60 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hand, Foot, Mouth Disease is a contagious viral infection that typically affects children, mostly younger children under the age of five," DHR Health Family Medicine Residency Program Director Dr. Naomi D'Acolatse said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the disease is commonly spread at schools and daycares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There have not been a publicized list of the schools due to privacy reasons, but they are considering this an outbreak and are monitoring closely," D'Acolatse said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED STORY:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.krgv.com/news/hidalgo-county-warns-residents-of-hand-foot-mouth-disease-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Hidalgo County warns residents of hand, foot, mouth disease outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For parents like Jazlyn Mora, it's personal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharr mother says her one-year-old was diagnosed with Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[I noticed] when she wasn't eating and when the blisters started occurring," Mora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mora says soon after, her daughter's temperature spiked to 102. It was then doctors diagnosed the one-year-old with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was not going to be a cure. Just to take the medicine on time and that she wasn't going to be able to eat for like a few days due to the pain that she's having in the mouth and all over the body," Mora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mora's daughter doesn't go to daycare. It's why she says she was so surprised by her daughter's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I just feel like we need to be more clean inside the house, or maybe she touched something or ate something that wasn't good and contained bacteria," Mora said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease can be spread through touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Typically, children are touching every surface, and they're putting their hands in their mouth and it's very important that hand hygiene is the top priority," D'Acolatse said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first signs are usually fever followed by sore throat and then blisters or ulcers around the mouth, on the gums, hands and bottom of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are encouraged to keep their child at home for about a week after being diagnosed to stop it from spreading further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the disease lasts about seven to 10 days, and they should isolate the infected child for the first 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/heart-disease-patients-should-get-vaccinated-against-respiratory-illnesses-including-covid-19-cardiology-experts-say"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart disease patients should get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, cardiology experts say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/should-you-eat-more-red-meat"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you eat more red meat?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Study: Lower targets for blood pressure can prevent heart attacks and strokes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also helps you live longer and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103"&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history and blood pressure, to determine risk. This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public. The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall. These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
