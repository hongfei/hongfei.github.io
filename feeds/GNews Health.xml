Sometimes, things just don't heal right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the Beverly-Hills based doctor revealed the most common botched procedures that he fixes, as well as his top tips for avoiding becoming a botched patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Be aware of the most commonly botched surgeries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Katzen said he sees the most complications from silicone injections, with an average 10 to 15 people per week seeking his help to reverse lumps, bumps and infections caused by the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can get the injections to enhance or reshape certain body parts by adding volume, smoothing wrinkles or contouring areas like the lips, buttocks, hips or face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these are illegal in the US, with the FDA saying they come with a risk of 'serious injury and disfigurement' that can happen weeks to months to even years after the injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karzen helps people with silicone injections by removing the silicone from their bodies, and also clearing up any scar tissue surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who had America's most common surgery liposuction were the next most common at his practice, with Dr Katzen saying he sees about five patients with complications from this procedure in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, they were struggling with loose or rippling skin, which was caused by too much fat being removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said they fix this by either injecting more fat into the area or by performing skin-tightening surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thigh lift, a procedure used to tighten skin around the legs, was the third most botched procedure the surgeon said, also with about five patients a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, he said, the incisions from the surgery — running from the groin to the knee — had opened, sometimes completely, and caused an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also mentioned a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), a notoriously dangerous procedure because it involves injecting fat into the buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, some of these fat cells may get into a blood vessel, in what is called a fat embolism, from which they can come to organs like the lungs and cause a blood clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeries normally have no complications if they are carried out by a trained and experienced surgeon. Statistics suggest less than one percent have complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Look for before and after photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When choosing a surgeon for your procedure, Dr Katzen said one of the most important factors to consider is their online before and after photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way for a surgeon to prove to the public that we do lots of these procedures, is to post lots of before and after pictures,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-dcaf6490-0f14-11f0-84e3-55cc4f15a517" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14548089/botched-surgery-advice-timothy-katzen.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;The most common botched procedures seen at Dr Katzen's office &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;ol class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Silicone injections&lt;/span&gt;  — 10 to 15 patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Liposuction &lt;/span&gt;— five patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Thigh lifts&lt;/span&gt; — four or five patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Facelift revisions&lt;/span&gt; — one or two a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Rhinoplasty revisions &lt;/span&gt;— one or two a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Surgeons can mention they did college and residency and are triple-board certified, have a fancy office, and tons of reviews online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, at the end of the day, they may have actually only carried out the procedure you're looking for on one patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before and after photos, however, allow prospective patients to see real results on a variety of body types.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Let your surgeon decide what you need&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients go to plastic surgeons demanding a particular surgery, and search for a new surgeon if their request is denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Katzen said it was important for patients to listen to a surgeon's professional opinion, which is based on years of training and hundreds to thousands of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think patients need to be cautious and trusting of their surgeons,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think patients should go to surgeons and say, "I want this!" Show the surgeon what's wrong and let them help decide the best thing for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For example, I have had people come in who say they want this area of skin [on their face under the eye] three millimeters higher, but in some cases that may not be possible or could actually give someone an unnatural appearance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned that refusing to listen to surgeons, even when they say you don't need or qualify for the procedure you're requesting, raises the risk of suffering from complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Don't go by price or recommendations from friends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Katzen advised people to try not to consider cost when searching for a surgeon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients consider cost and friends' recommendations when choosing a surgeon, but Dr Katzen cautioned not to prioritize these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you are considering a plastic surgery procedure, then do your research, but do not shop around based on prices,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just go for the surgery you can afford, but don't go for the lowest bidder. Go for the surgeon you feel is the most experienced in your procedure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advised not following the recommendations of friends, saying they may have had a different type of procedure or have a different body type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Avoid illegal procedures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients have turned to illegal silicone injections from illicit surgeons and are now having to have it removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silicone is a synthetic substance that is used in implants for its soft texture that mimics the feel of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the FDA has banned it being injected into patients except in very rare procedures because of the high risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said he has seen many patients suffering from silicone complications, including many referred to him by other surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In past cases, he has had people who had swollen penises due to the injections or buttocks where holes had opened up in them due to the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Know what surgeries to skip&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said&lt;span&gt; nearly all surgeries can provide excellent results, as long as they are carried out by a well-trained and experienced surgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he did say there was one procedure, which he has only seen online, he would avoid. The operation is a facelift-like surgery in which a patient's skin is sewn together on the cheeks to give them a face-lift-like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This differs from a normal facelift, where incisions are made in front of the ears or a brow lift, where they are made along the hairline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's making people look like pincushions,' he said, 'I wouldn't recommend that one'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wasn't clear on the name of the procedure, but said it differed from a thread lift — which has been approved by the FDA for skin lifting and tightening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen added: 'But the rest are legitimate, and are good in experienced hands. Most of the time the ones who get botched procedures have not been with surgeons who have proper training or who haven't done it before and are inexperienced.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;The safest surgery REVEALED &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Asked if there were any surgeries that rarely cause complications, Dr Katzen said complications appeared to be lowest with hair transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We see a lot of the body lift, tummy tuck over the hip, and others that are botched — where they've maybe taken out too much or too little skin,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But one of the safer surgeries, I would say, is actually hair transplants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With each hair transplant we do it on the back of the head, in a place where it isn't going to be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then, with the transplant itself, if we lose a couple of hairs, that is ok, that is part of the accepted risk. It is very rare that patients experience blood loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 650,000 people in the US get hair transplants every year, estimates suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 02:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPQ05OSWNlSDFZTUx1TGhqS1JVNEpzM0pQd19oa3JEN25nUXFka0JXRi04ZmFZdVlkZ1Q4MVJuOWotRmlYbTdmMHRYeC1xSkQ5NWd2a3NzNGl1SlJrSy1yWkdQZTZGVjQzUXdOYzBBM2dYcGhybU41RTBndE5YS25IXzB0dzFJQnYyVTdrMTdYZmFvTmctQ0xUMl9B0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5rRFRQd3VFcHJ0UUhVY3FDZzVRTE1GeHc3SEZOb2RZeE9xX2M2NGdkNndHNThrczd0aTJoaTM2cEstQTUxVXpXa0puNHdlemNDWlF6R2ZZMGhMUTJYTEpQN0FkUlJtOHpLVGNEVVBYMnROZU9MSC1jRV8tVTRUU1l2cHJVUmZfUVctVUIwY0ZvLWF4NFRKeFcwc3dCNy1OVQ</guid></item><item><title>5 Supplements You Should Take to Relieve Constipation, According to a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5TY0FUcjAzU0NFQ0RlS0lwNmFKOTlpNkdHcE05XzhkeDlGejNLMWFVWHc5ZHBzdmdFR1lxd1VJWWFaR043ejA5RldVUllyZU1odW96NDRXN2dxSkhxR2NkeVNsUzZyZ3FEWjNYYWxRXzNQR2tPYzFkMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy diet and hydration should be your first defense against constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When these aren’t enough, certain supplements can provide safe, effective relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gastroenterologist recommends psyllium, probiotics, magnesium and polyethylene glycol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation isn’t anyone’s ideal state of digestive affairs. The bloating, distension and overall discomfort of a gastrointestinal slow-down are a combo you’d probably prefer to skip. But for most of us, being backed up is an occasional fact of life (sometimes even a chronic one). Constipation is so common, in fact, that about 16% of U.S. adults say it’s a problem.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, certain dietary supplements can help get things moving again. Though they may not work immediately, with a little patience, the right choices may make you feel lighter and brighter sooner than later. We tapped&lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist with Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology, a division of Allied Digestive Health, for her top supplement recommendations for constipation. She says the following five are worth a try.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-psyllium-husk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Psyllium Husk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With its surging popularity on social media, psyllium husk may seem like a buzzy modern supplement. But it’s been used in Ayurvedic medicine as a natural remedy for constipation for thousands of years. What makes it so effective? Psyllium husk is rich in soluble fiber, which creates a slick, gel-like substance in the digestive tract that retains water. This, in turn, makes your poops easier to pass, Shukla says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides psyllium’s ability to hold water, research reveals that it may also get things going by positively impacting &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;. Those are the trillions of bacteria that regulate a healthy digestive tract. For instance, one small study found that supplementing with psyllium husk for four weeks led to beneficial changes in the gut microbiota of people with constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And another older study reported similar improvements in as little as one week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just note that psyllium husk can cause side effects in some people. (Shukla says a feeling of bloating is especially common.) You may want to start with a small dose to test your tolerance gradually. Also good to know: while supplements containing insoluble fiber may claim to ease constipation, they can actually make things worse. So, stick with soluble fiber-containing psyllium instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-probiotics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By now, you’ve probably heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. These beneficial, live bacteria may be an inexpensive, over-the-counter means of maintaining a happy gut. Here’s a tip, though: don’t just choose any old strain you see. Current research shows that certain probiotic strains may be more helpful than others for specific health issues, including constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One that has a solid track record is&lt;em&gt; Lactobacillus reuteri.&lt;/em&gt; It works by getting your gut moving, helping you go more often.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, look for this strain specifically, or ask your doctor if another strain might be right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-magnesium-oxide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Magnesium Oxide &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is often touted as a constipation preventer. However, with so many forms of this mineral on supplement shelves, it can be hard to distinguish which one is best. Shukla recommends magnesium oxide. Like psyllium husk, she says magnesium oxide draws more water into the stool, keeping things nice and soft to help with easier evacuation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This form of magnesium may be particularly useful for treating chronic constipation that doesn’t have a known cause (also known as idiopathic constipation). In fact, the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology recently released new guidelines recommending magnesium oxide as a pharmacological treatment for idiopathic constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But don’t be put off by the “pharmacological” terminology—magnesium oxide is available over the counter.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla says you can find magnesium oxide in different strengths. “I usually recommend starting at 200 or 250 milligrams [per day] and increasing to a maximum of 1,000 milligrams per day.” She also notes that people with decreased kidney function should avoid taking magnesium, as it can build to dangerous levels if the kidneys are unable to filter it properly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-polyethylene-glycol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Polyethylene Glycol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Never heard of polyethylene glycol? You may have seen it in dietary supplements without realizing it’s there. This compound is the active ingredient in powdered supplements like MiraLax and its generic equivalents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla recommends polyethylene glycol for its ease of use and effectiveness in alleviating constipation. “It is tasteless and odorless and therefore well tolerated,” she says. “Its absorption from the gut is negligible, making it a safe and effective option for treating constipation.” And unlike over-the-counter laxatives that should only be used occasionally, it’s safe for longer-term use. For instance, one study found that polyethylene glycol was safe and effective in reducing the frequency of hard or lumpy stools in people with chronic idiopathic constipation over the course of 24 weeks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-prunes-and-prune-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Prunes and Prune Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out, Grandma was onto something. While not a supplement per se, the old &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-to-help-you-poop-8649695" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prune juice remedy&lt;/a&gt; really is a smart move for getting regular again. And there’s research to prove it. For instance, one study found that people with chronic constipation who drank slightly less than 2 ounces of prune juice daily for eight weeks experienced significantly fewer hard or lumpy stools.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That makes it food as medicine for the win!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prunes have high dietary fiber and sorbitol, both helpful for treating constipation,” explains Shukla. “This contributes to increased stool bulk and improved bowel movements.” Just one-quarter cup of prunes (about 5 prunes) provides 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Sorbitol, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that offers some surprising benefits for digestive health. “Sorbitol has osmotic properties that draw water into the intestines, keeping stool soft and easy to expel,” says Shukla. In fact, some people with quick intestinal transit actually &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; sorbitol for this reason. So, if you want to give prunes or prune juice a try, start slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your digestive tract gets a bit sluggish, a healthy diet, proper hydration and exercise should be your first lines of defense. When they aren’t enough, the supplement aisle has safe, effective options for constipation relief. Psyllium husk, probiotics, magnesium oxidize and polyethylene glycol are all gastroenterologist-approved supplements for constipation relief. And if you’d prefer a more natural remedy, give prunes or prune juice a try. They may not be trendy, but they work!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. said Sunday that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” his &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most direct statement yet&lt;/a&gt; on the issue, following the death of a second child of the condition in the outbreak in West Texas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has long described the vaccine as dangerous, has largely avoided endorsing its use since the start of the outbreak, and he stopped short of explicitly saying he “recommended” it in his latest remarks, as public health officials have called on him to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hours later, Kennedy promoted unorthodox, unproven treatments for the disease in &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;. He spent time with “extraordinary healers,” he said — doctors Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards — who had treated children with measles with aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those drugs, a steroid and antibiotic, respectively, are &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/03/the-measles-vaccine-is-our-best-tool-to-protect-individuals-against-the-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not proven&lt;/a&gt; measles treatments, physicians and health experts have said after Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;previously promoted them&lt;/a&gt;. Budesonide may even weaken the immune system, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less than a month ago, Kennedy said — &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/14/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-death-claims-scientists-disagree/"&gt;against current evidence&lt;/a&gt; — that the measles shot caused deaths every year. At the time, he pointed to the importance of nutrition and personal choice in getting the shot, even as he &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines “not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in West Texas has continued to grow and has also spread to Kansas and Oklahoma. The second fatality in West Texas — after an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;adult with measles died in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; — came Thursday, prompting Kennedy to travel there in a show of support and to attend the girl’s funeral. He said while there he met with the family of the 8-year-old, Daisy, as well as the family of the first child to die in the outbreak, Kayley, 6. Neither girl had been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he said &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in his initial post on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s post did not mention nutrition, vitamin A as a treatment, or the importance of personal choice in getting the shot, as some of his earlier statements did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He instead said he would be redeploying a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Texas at the request of the state’s governor, Greg Abbott. Kennedy came to the state to learn how the Department of Health and Human Services can support the state’s efforts to contain the virus, he said, adding HHS would “follow Texas’ lead” in addressing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s comments come after years of sowing doubt about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, despite overwhelming evidence that contradicted his claims. Concerns that he would damage Americans’ health because of that history threatened to tank his Senate confirmation to the role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In making his case before the Senate, Kennedy promised to renew trust in health agencies before becoming the top health official in the country. But he’s now facing a growing outbreak of a disease that is being fueled in part by low vaccination rates as well as the persistence of misinformation, public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to Kennedy’s latest post, the anti-vaccine nonprofit he led before taking charge of HHS, Children’s Health Defense, was characterizing the measles vaccine as dangerous on its website. Responses to Kennedy’s post on X included some users suggesting people shouldn’t get the shot and others arguing Kennedy’s post didn’t represent the movement he had long represented. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health experts&lt;a href="https://x.com/JReinerMD/status/1908976909771211142" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; praised Kennedy’s initial weekend statement&lt;/a&gt; that the measles vaccine is the most effective tool to stop the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Others said he needed to do more as the virus continues to spread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He needs to state plainly … that the MMR is safe, and that unvaccinated patients should receive it,” Michelle Au, a physician and Georgia politician, &lt;a href="https://x.com/AuforGA/status/1908982130694303811" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a response&lt;/a&gt; on X. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least one Senate Republican also wants stronger messaging for everyone getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;previously concerned&lt;/a&gt; about Kennedy’s ability to lead HHS, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1908903799701303633" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a post&lt;/a&gt; before Kennedy’s own statement. “Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

were not getting their medications on time and were &lt;a href="/news/health/corridor-care-job-ad-norovirus-b2705736.html"&gt;missing doses &lt;/a&gt;needed to manage their illnesses – putting them at risk of getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/insulin"&gt;Insulin&lt;/a&gt;

with long waiting times often contributing to this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on oral levodopa for Parkinson's and insulin for diabetes, as these are common in patients in A&amp;amp;E and must be given on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data from 136 emergency departments in the UK which submitted data for more than 13,000 people in A&amp;amp;E who were on insulin injections or levodopa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was part of the College's clinical Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) which aims to improve the care of A&amp;amp;E patients, found more than half of these patients were not identified as being on TCM within 30 minutes of their arrival in an emergency department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, 68 per cent of doses were not administered within 30 minutes of the expected time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings contained in this report should serve as a call to action for both emergency medicine staff, as well as patients reliant on time critical medications, to ensure no dose is ever missed in A&amp;amp;E," said Dr Jonny Acheson, an emergency medicine consultant in Leicester who has Parkinson's, led the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed that paramedics and emergency medicine staff need to ask patients what medications they take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, those with Parkinson's and insulin treated diabetes need to tell staff and take their medications with them if they visit an A&amp;amp;E. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the NHS must think about how they identify people taking these types of medication and how they are able to ensure they receive their doses on time, every time while they are in the emergency department,” he added. "These medicines are critical to the quality of these patients lives and we have a duty of care to ensure that they receive them when they should." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations made by the QIP team include that patients on vital medications should be identified early when they attend A&amp;amp;E, to prevent any missed doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that systems need to be in place to ensure medication is given on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ian Higginson, RCEM president-elect, said that this a problem “we should not be having to fix” and suggested long waiting times are partly to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has risen to prominence because of the increasing number of our patients who are having to endure ridiculously long waits in our emergency departments - 12, 24, 48 hours and even longer,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed that missing doses of medication for Parkinson's or diabetes is not just “inconvenient” it can be “dangerous” and have “serious consequences”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's UK praised the RCEM's work while &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes-uk"&gt;Diabetes UK&lt;/a&gt; said delayed or missed insulin doses can be a potentially life-threatening emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: "We welcome this report and will look closely at the findings, to ensure any patient in need of time critical medicine does not lose out when in A&amp;amp;E and receives the medication they need or support to self-administer as they would at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the report makes clear, it is welcome to see improvements thanks to the hard work of frontline staff but more generally we know A&amp;amp;E waiting times are far too long and our upcoming urgent and emergency care plan will set out how we aim to bring these down ahead of next winter." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 23:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQUHByTXNaelFuTDFvb1d6SXhXTjlneTRtQzdXWmJzVTk5dnp2SFlObHlfbFdpb0l5SC0yVmJsaE9jOFRYS1YtRVM0TVRUanczQUh2WXhoRUM0anBDaXJkNVpfZE9JcmtlbGV2dEV2VVNhaFlKbGdMUXJ3VE1MYnRHV0poQ1NYNDg2cEZRSkhyT05mWEhFU0l2ZnctbjBaam1uQ2c4dW5OZncxRWt0R1E</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. visits epicenter of Texas measles outbreak after second child who was infected dies - PBS</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPbUN1T20tWVF0cVFzY1hKbEdHbG9nQWVRNC1qLTBvR0dUMHhpUGg3VWNTTW9nbHFUTmhid19HdUZWTVJNNUl6MUJQcHhiSTNOLXoxdGtEZ0xxdDk1S3BQMlVNb3dBbWlRZHRCT2dLamdSN0lvUkU0aHdwbjZhTVdpTktuOHhlVHF6UzQwQy1HbEIzdkl1U2NXX0xIZHItVEpNeWhUNVF6bFZFY2l1UDdtSFJrNE0xaUlqTDJpQVhCR2xpbnlmMk00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas’ still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/second-child-dies-from-measles-related-causes-in-west-texas-where-cases-approach-500"&gt;READ MORE: Second child dies from measles-related causes in West Texas, where cases approach 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to “control the outbreak” and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminole is the &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/"&gt;epicenter of the outbreak,&lt;/a&gt; which started in late January and continues to swell — with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second young child died Thursday from “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,” and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was “receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Kennedy’s first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he “developed bonds” with the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/mennonites-west-texans-at-center-of-measles-outbreak-choose-medical-freedom-over-vaccine-mandates"&gt;Mennonite community in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; in which the virus is mostly spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation’s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to “delay care” for a child who is sick with measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Call your doctor and make sure you’re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC teams arrived in early March, Patel said. But Kennedy’s social media post noted that CDC employees have been “redeployed,” and the nation’s public health agency never relayed it had pulled back. Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy’s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1908903799701303633"&gt;in a post on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,” he wrote. “Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a “personal one” and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People “should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors’ warnings that it should be given under a physician’s orders and that too much can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they’ve treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration’s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the epitome of an absolute needless death,” Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. “These kids should get vaccinated — that’s how you prevent people from dying of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn’t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease — and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide — some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Samuele Cortese, the senior lead author of the study, from the University of Southampton, said the risks and benefits of taking any medication had to be assessed together, but for ADHD drugs the risk-benefit ratio was “reassuring”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications,” he said. “Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 3 to 4% of adults and 5% of children in the UK are believed to have ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, disorganisation and difficulty focusing, according to the National Institute for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Care Excellence (Nice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Doctors can prescribe stimulants, such as methylphenidate, of which the best-known brand is Ritalin. Other stimulant medications used to treat ADHD include lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine.

The researchers advised people with existing heart conditions to discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, a consultant psychiatrist and expert on ADHD, said most clinicians prescribing ADHD medication understood the cardiovascular risks and followed Nice guidelines for monitoring blood pressure, pulse and weight. “We need more detailed guidelines for scenarios when ADHD medication needs to be adjusted or stopped,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last year, a thinktank warned that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; was experiencing an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/04/nhs-faces-avalanche-of-demand-for-autism-and-adhd-services-thinktank-warns" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“avalanche of need”&lt;/a&gt; over autism and ADHD, and said the system in place to cope with surging demand for assessments and treatments was “obsolete”. The number of prescriptions issued in England for ADHD medication &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/11/adhd-prescriptions-in-england-have-risen-by-18-each-year-since-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has risen by 18% year on year &lt;/a&gt;since the pandemic, with the biggest rise in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Tony Lord, a former chief executive of the ADHD Foundation, said the long-term benefits of ADHD medication were well established, and included a reduced risk of anxiety and depression, eating disorders, harm from smoking, improved educational outcomes and economic independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sadly ignorance about ADHD medications persists – a throwback to the 80s and 90s when ADHD medications were mistakenly viewed as a morality pill that made naughty, fidgety disruptive children behave – which of course it is not,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is simply a cognitive enhancer that improves information processing, inhibits distractions, improves focus, planning and prioritising, self monitoring and reduces impulsivity of thought and action.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNZjRJTlpSS2UxV3YxVGlWUGNITzNDZkhJLVFfbjNWVjJxM2JqNDl6MTE3RjFUSnhIUEppNmRRazRsekJSN1BMaGtlZm9DNlMza25VWEx1czhOenB1TFllNklqS2RYQ1J4SXUzVEowTFRjaVl0YjdadkloRnZEbEhrejk1aWs5aHFGLVR1MXJXREdmVWlxcUJvZE1iZzc1TWEz</guid></item><item><title>FDA-approved sleeping pill offers new hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOZ1FnbGx3TFZPSHlQR1VzdHcxYmpUTWpPUWQ2cmpNZ3UzcWdlTGNQWllhU1JFX1Q5QVFOcjc1TzBibEN6MjJGdUdvblFEY0JuODE4a25FcE56TE8zNGZkZGpDcHpwSlhFLUd6UXlGNjcxN3c0TFoySnNZT2cwaWtLRThqaklKOHdqNmxSMUFiTzFVbzBBU1A1SXNxMVg4U3lGb1EwNWsxd0RHRTlteS11YWFOS0dVV2VfNDVyRFZYOTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is notorious for robbing individuals of memory and cognitive function. Researchers have struggled for decades to find effective treatments, yet none have successfully halted or reversed the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a study, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, points to an unexpected solution: a medication commonly used to help people sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists recently discovered that a sleeping pill, already FDA-approved to treat insomnia, can temporarily reduce harmful proteins associated with Alzheimer's. The drug, known as suvorexant, targets the protein build-up that characterizes Alzheimer's, potentially slowing its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery adds weight to the growing understanding that sleep is critical in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/natural-dietary-supplement-proven-effective-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer's prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Poor sleep can contribute to the disease’s early development, causing harmful proteins to accumulate in the brain. Better sleep might help clear these proteins, offering hope for prevention or delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on unphosphorylated tau (i.e., total tau).

Trouble sleeping can serve as an early warning sign, showing up years before memory loss. Poor sleep quality raises levels of two critical proteins—amyloid-beta and tau—in the brain. These proteins build up into plaques and tangles, eventually causing neurons to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found a direct link between &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-connect-sleep-habits-to-mortality-rate-study-finds/"&gt;disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt; and higher levels of amyloid-beta and tau. Even one night of poor sleep can cause amyloid-beta to spike, speeding its accumulation. Better sleep quality might flush out these harmful proteins, slowing Alzheimer's disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, treating sleep issues isn't as straightforward as taking any sleeping pill. Most sleep medications help people fall asleep quickly but may limit the deeper, restorative sleep phases. These phases are crucial to clearing harmful brain proteins. Thus, finding a medication that truly enhances sleep quality is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="suvorexant_more_than_just_a_sleep_aid_"&gt;Suvorexant: More Than Just a Sleep Aid?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small but compelling study led by Dr. Brendan Lucey at &lt;a href="https://sleep.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, scientists explored how suvorexant affects Alzheimer's-linked proteins. Suvorexant belongs to a new class of sleep medications called dual orexin receptor antagonists. Orexin is a molecule that promotes wakefulness; suvorexant blocks it, promoting deeper sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 38 healthy adults, ages 45 to 65, without sleep problems or signs of cognitive impairment. Participants spent two nights at a sleep clinic, receiving either suvorexant or a placebo pill. Researchers collected cerebrospinal fluid—a clear liquid surrounding the brain—every two hours through a small tube placed in participants' lower backs. This fluid carries waste away from the brain, including amyloid-beta and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, after just one dose of suvorexant, amyloid-beta levels dropped by 10% to 20%, compared to the placebo. A higher dose (20 mg, typically prescribed for insomnia) also lowered a particular form of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/major-new-study-identifies-key-protein-driving-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;tau protein&lt;/a&gt;, phosphorylated tau, by about 10% to 15%. Phosphorylated tau is crucial because it directly forms harmful tangles that destroy brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on phosphorylated tau/unphosphorylated tau ratio. (CREDIT: Annals of Neurology) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a positive sign," said Dr. Lucey, director of Washington University's Sleep Medicine Center. "If you can reduce tau phosphorylation, potentially there would be less tangle formation and less neuronal death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the benefits were temporary. Tau protein levels returned to normal within 24 hours after taking suvorexant. However, repeated nightly doses might keep &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-proteins-repair-heart-muscle-and-regenerate-organs/"&gt;harmful proteins&lt;/a&gt; at consistently lower levels. Dr. Lucey emphasized caution, though: "It would be premature for people who are worried about developing Alzheimer's to interpret it as a reason to start taking suvorexant every night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="limitations_and_future_directions"&gt;Limitations and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the encouraging results, researchers urge caution. This initial study was brief, involving only two nights and a small group. It did not assess the long-term impacts of taking suvorexant regularly, nor did it test older adults at higher risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still aren't certain whether lowering &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/new-study-finds-that-alzheimers-can-be-passed-from-one-person-to-another/"&gt;amyloid-beta&lt;/a&gt; and tau temporarily will prevent Alzheimer's altogether. Previous studies have questioned the idea that reducing these proteins is enough to stop or slow the disease. Many treatments that successfully reduce amyloid-beta have failed to improve memory or cognitive symptoms in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Dr. Lucey remains hopeful. He believes future studies, lasting months rather than days, might reveal more lasting effects. His team plans to test suvorexant in older adults already showing early amyloid buildup but not yet experiencing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not quite there yet," he admitted. "I'm hopeful that we will eventually develop drugs that take advantage of the link between sleep and Alzheimer's to prevent &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-red-meat-increases-risk-of-dementia-and-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="should_you_consider_sleeping_pills_"&gt;Should You Consider Sleeping Pills?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While promising, these findings don't mean everyone should reach for suvorexant to protect against Alzheimer's. Long-term use of sleeping pills can lead to dependence, reduced effectiveness, and other health risks. They might even negatively impact sleep quality over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on amyloid-β (Aβ).

Dr. Lucey stresses the importance of improving sleep naturally, advising individuals concerned about Alzheimer’s to consult a sleep specialist rather than relying solely on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this research highlights the intriguing potential of sleep as a powerful preventive measure against Alzheimer's. If future studies confirm that deep, restful sleep can protect the brain from harmful proteins, sleep-based therapies could become a central approach to preventing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Lucey puts it, better sleep "is a sensible approach to improving general brain health at any age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="suvorexant_a_brief_history_in_time"&gt;Suvorexant: A Brief History in Time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suvorexant, marketed as Belsomra, is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved for the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/magnetic-pulses-aimed-at-the-brain-could-treat-insomnia-study-finds/"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by Merck &amp;amp; Co., Inc., the drug's journey began in the early 2000s, aiming to address the significant unmet need for effective insomnia treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-throughput screening for orexin receptor antagonists commenced in 2005, leading to the discovery and subsequent approval of suvorexant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suvorexant functions by selectively inhibiting the orexin receptors OX₁ and OX₂, which play a crucial role in regulating wakefulness. By blocking these receptors, suvorexant diminishes the wake-promoting influence of orexin neuropeptides, thereby facilitating sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is distinct from traditional &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-research-reveals-the-surprising-global-impact-of-insomnia/"&gt;insomnia medications&lt;/a&gt; that typically enhance sleep-promoting signals via gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of suvorexant in improving both sleep onset and maintenance. In pooled analyses of three-month studies, patients receiving 20/15 mg of suvorexant experienced significant enhancements in total sleep time and reductions in wake after sleep onset compared to placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse effect being &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/somnolence-drowsiness#:~:text=Somnolence%2C%20also%20known%20as%20drowsiness,of%20several%20types%20of%20medications." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;somnolence&lt;/a&gt;, which was typically mild to moderate and occurred early in the treatment course. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="27" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond primary insomnia, suvorexant has shown promise in addressing sleep disturbances associated with various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="28" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Always consult your doctor or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, procedure, or treatment, whether it is a prescription medication, over-the-counter drug, vitamin, supplement, or herbal alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 22:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOZ1FnbGx3TFZPSHlQR1VzdHcxYmpUTWpPUWQ2cmpNZ3UzcWdlTGNQWllhU1JFX1Q5QVFOcjc1TzBibEN6MjJGdUdvblFEY0JuODE4a25FcE56TE8zNGZkZGpDcHpwSlhFLUd6UXlGNjcxN3c0TFoySnNZT2cwaWtLRThqaklKOHdqNmxSMUFiTzFVbzBBU1A1SXNxMVg4U3lGb1EwNWsxd0RHRTlteS11YWFOS0dVV2VfNDVyRFZYOTA</guid></item><item><title>'Misokinesia' Phenomenon Could Affect 1 in 3 People, Study Shows - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNU9UalI0dmxPSktXTGJiYk5VSDlVTWJPeWR1R3ZWRFE3ZENDMU1HbGNJdHUwXzVQdE1wODdhc3FGengzbHRrTmpRaHV3Nk5KNnNvbWdWMW5LOHM3LW1GdlN1eFBrRUM5c0wyQVkxc2daeEdlU25pY1BnNGVtTUd4QUVEYXdPNkVXU25xYmtiU05rYTZI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Noticing somebody fidgeting can be distracting. Vexing. Even excruciating. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research, the stressful sensations caused by seeing others fidget are an incredibly common psychological phenomenon, affecting as many as one in three people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://www.misokinesia.ca"&gt;misokinesia&lt;/a&gt; – meaning 'hatred of movements' – this strange phenomenon had been little studied by scientists until recent years, but was noted in the context of a related condition, &lt;a href="a-super-sensitive-brain-connection-could-be-why-some-people-can-t-stand-certain-sounds"&gt;misophonia&lt;/a&gt;: a disorder where people become &lt;a href="can-t-stand-the-sound-of-people-chewing-blame-your-brain-science-misophonia"&gt;irritated upon hearing certain repetitious sounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misokinesia is somewhat similar, but the triggers are generally more visual, rather than sound-related, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[Misokinesia] is defined as a strong negative affective or emotional response to the sight of someone else's small and repetitive movements, such as seeing someone mindlessly fidgeting with a hand or foot," a team of researchers, led by first author and psychologist Sumeet Jaswal, then at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;explained in a study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet surprisingly, scientific research on the topic is lacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg" alt="hands fidgeting" class="wp-image-144167 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Misokenesia creates strong emotional responses on seeing small, repetitive movements. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding, Jawal and fellow researchers conducted what they said was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;"first in-depth scientific exploration"&lt;/a&gt; of misokinesia – and the results indicate that heightened sensitivity to fidgeting is something a large number of people have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a series of experiments involving over 4,100 participants, the researchers measured the prevalence of misokinesia in a cohort of university students and people from the general population, assessing the impacts it had upon them, and exploring why the sensations might manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that approximately one-third self-reported some degree of misokinesia sensitivity to the repetitive, fidgeting behaviors of others as encountered in their daily lives," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results support the conclusion that misokinesia sensitivity is not a phenomenon restricted to clinical populations, but rather, is a basic and heretofore under-recognized social challenge shared by many in the wider, general population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the analysis, misokinesia sometimes goes hand in hand with the sound-sensitivity of misophonia, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon seems to vary significantly among individuals, with some people reporting only low sensitivity to fidgeting stimuli, while others feel highly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are negatively impacted emotionally and experience reactions such as anger, anxiety, or frustration as well as reduced enjoyment in social situations, work, and learning environments," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; UBC psychologist Todd Handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some even pursue fewer social activities because of the condition.".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handy began researching misokinesia after a partner told him he was a fidgeter and confessed she felt stress when he fidgeted (or anybody else for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a visual cognitive neuroscientist, this really piqued my interest to find out what is happening in the brain," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the million-dollar question stands: Why do we find fidgeting so annoying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers ran tests to see if people's misokinesia might originate in heightened visual-attentional sensitivities, amounting to an inability to block out distracting events occurring in their visual periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results based on early experiments were inconclusive on that front, with the researchers finding no firm evidence that reflexive visual attentional mechanisms substantively contribute to misokinesia sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're still only at the outset then of exploring where misokinesia may spring from on a cognitive level, the researchers do have some hypothetical leads for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One possibility we want to explore is that their '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"&gt;mirror neurons&lt;/a&gt;' are at play," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These neurons activate when we move but they also activate when we see others move… For example, when you see someone get hurt, you may wince as well, as their pain is mirrored in your own brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extension, it's possible that misokinesia-prone people might be unconsciously empathizing with the psychology of fidgeters. And not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A reason that people fidget is because they're anxious or nervous so when individuals who suffer from misokinesia see someone fidgeting, they may mirror it and feel anxious or nervous as well," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether that's what's really going on here with misokinesia, only further research into the phenomenon will be able to say for sure. A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0313169"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Jaswal in 2024 on 21 volunteers found the condition may be linked to challenges in disengaging from a stimulus, rather than about the initial distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though. From the results seen here, it's clear that this unusual phenomenon is much more usual than we realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To those who are suffering from misokinesia, you are not alone," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;. "Your challenge is common and it's real."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are reported in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

care because of hidden costs - even as the disease is surging among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy - the golden standard of colon cancer screening - is recommended for every 10 years starting at the age of 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On most insurance plans, the procedure should cost on average $79 out-of-pocket, with health insurers footing the rest of the about $2,125 bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recently, patients have come forward to say they've been charged upward of $5,000, $7,000 and even $20,000 for the procedure, despite having health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14530871/twin-colon-cancer-doctor-cause-revealed.html"&gt;patients were just trying to 'do the right thing'&lt;/a&gt; and often didn't have symptoms suggesting they had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors slammed these bills, warning surprise - and unaffordable -  costs could put people off getting screened, meaning cancers may not be detected until it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, told DailyMail.com: 'The majority of people who do preventative screening should have very little out-of-pocket cost, regardless of where they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But there are horror stories, with the exception being when someone goes out of network for their physical or hospital.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are raising fears that patients may be avoiding colonoscopies because of hidden costs — even amid alarm over rising cases among young adults (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the expected out-of-pocket cost for a colonoscopy, based on a survey of 333,000 claims from 2014 to 2019, and the price some patients have been faced with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Screening reveals benign polyps that aren't cancer, but by removing them we are reducing the risk of cancer developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If patients are putting off colonoscopies worrying about costs, then this means these aren't removed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned: &lt;span&gt;'If you put off screening and don't do anything, there's certainly a much higher probability that when you go in, you have symptoms,' which may raise the risk of being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer often causes no symptoms until it has spread to other areas of the body, where it becomes harder to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But warning signs can include trouble using the bathroom, blood in feces and persistent diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors fear that, faced with the risk of high prices, patients may put off any screenings — which can find pre-cancerous growths and eliminate them, slashing the risk of developing the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also put off screenings even when they have symptoms, risking the cancer reaching an advanced stage — making it harder to treat and deadlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 67 percent of adults adhere to current screening requirements, below the US government target of at least 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one case, a small business owner from Illinois was hit with a bill for $7,000 after getting a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tim Winard, 57, had no symptoms of the disease, but opted to get screened to 'do the right thing' and be on the safe side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had six-month short-term health insurance, which he took out while he worked on his business. He said his insurer told him he could get the cancer screening 'anywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went to Endeavor Health Elmhurst Hospital outside Chicago and was in and out of the center the same day. Later, he was told his results were normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 have risen over the past two decades. This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But then his bill came. He was charged $7,000 after his insurance paid only $814.47 towards the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Confused, he contacted the insurance company and said a representative told him the insurance would not pay more because his procedure was 'out of network'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Winard then contacted the media, with his story first reported by &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/short-term-health-plan-surprise-billing-7k-colonoscopy-bill-of-the-month-march-2025/?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20Daily%20Health%20Policy%20Report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gr0b1tETHRI7mC3lqoHKi1v9RlboX4o2d2mKTSy-hqDl8NcI-VwqhPROdgDzUJUcKSH1e_v-38iFqipcdiof9_FaAGdPE33YSsNKZlr8O9Sb4F0I&amp;amp;_hsmi=354058799&amp;amp;utm_content=354058799&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After they contacted the health insurer, he was issued a new bill for only $770 — with no explanation given for the shift in the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another case, Mike Meier from Georgia, who had health insurance through Alliant, went to get a colonoscopy after it was recommended by his doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The screening found a benign polyp on his colon and it was successfully removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But then he received the bill, totaling $10,745, prompting him to immediately contact his insurer and hospital — Aurora Health Care — to ask about the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through numerous complaints and appeals, it eventually emerged that his insurance company had misprinted his insurance card to suggest he had out-of-network coverage for more than just emergency care - when he actually did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the error, however, his insurer was still unwilling to pay because he had taken out an insurance plan with a $20,000 deductible. (Most plans have a deductible around $1,790).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the Affordable Care Act, healthcare plans are required to cover certain preventive services, including screenings for colon cancer in asymptomatic adults, for those who are 45 to 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mr Meier was short of that when he had the procedure, just a few months from his 45th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a third case, a patient on Reddit came forward two months ago to say they had a colonoscopy with an in-network doctor and was charged $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient, who was not named, said beforehand they had contacted their doctor and the billing office who said the procedure was covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tim Winard, 57, had no symptoms of the disease, but opted to get screened to 'do the right thing' and be on the safe side. Despite having health insurance, he was slapped with a $7,000 bill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after receiving two denial letters, the patient had been billed, with the insurance saying the surgery center and anesthesiologist were out-of-network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colonoscopies are complex procedures, that often require a doctor to undertake them as well as an anesthesiologist to ensure a patient's comfort when deep sedation and general anesthesia are used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A breakdown of the costs was not revealed, but people commenting said the patient was likely being billed for their doctor, the surgery center and the anesthesiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The post was flooded with 236 comments from others who also said they had been charged outrageous amounts for colonoscopies or similar procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said that to get a colonoscopy at a lower price patients should always contact their insurer first to ensure the colonoscopy is in network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also recommended going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital, which tends to be cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2021.2015157"&gt; 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; that examined healthcare claims among 333,000 adults with average risk of colon cancer between 2014 and 2019 found that they paid, on average, $79 out-of-pocket for a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Misleading and confusing payment and coverage information has doctors worried because of the rapid surge in colon cancer cases, particularly among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 12 cases per 100,000 people under the age of 45 years were reported in 2021, data suggests, compared to less than six per 100,000 in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:44:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQdVU2WDJnRkNzQnBhSmtaZ2Rka1FRbGJkd0xqTjJYUFpKMUpIRGNGb1VEYjc3dTVremc1WnczempjeHZVY1JacXhRUGxNOWRqc1JVQUdPbDZsNzZlOGJPZ0ZlR1NURzZVS2JtZE1yOVd5R1ZjRFJ6cWU0TkJjXzdnalY4dGsxa29kWDR2VXRmSDhSNEI3QUNFRnFheHM5ZnlwNGJ5Z1NxdV9hMVZRQUHSAbMBQVVfeXFMTVRHSFFGYnEyOE5udTU0dDFXakN0d0FIdnNaSDBmSjVFV05WRE9saHRxRjV5NzBaMWtRbExpOWtNQlVtUXdONV9OZ3liRTNwSGg2THpyU1pLNXlnbmw4bWVuUTRDQWdMTTRaNGhoTjJrc3o2OVNwbVc3RE5RUGlMeERaQ0xidGpOenIwTWVuYUt1TlZmbmJrMUhvNC1oTmlGZkJaNFdnTlpVTGcxeEJGbGV3WkE</guid></item><item><title>How does the human brain create and retrieve memories?

Some ideas revolve around chemical changes in specific neurons, while others focus on structural shifts among brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=tryan6"&gt;Dr. Tomás Ryan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Trinity College Dublin&lt;/a&gt; is among the neuroscientists who have explored these questions by tracking cells involved in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-isnt-only-stored-in-our-brains-other-cells-can-remember-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01512-9"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; suggest memory formation hinges on connections between groups of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02137-5"&gt;engram cells&lt;/a&gt;, which are neurons thought to capture and store distinct experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-memories-become-linked"&gt;How memories become linked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe each experience leaves a pattern of brain cell activation that can be switched on later. To see this process in action, neuroscientists tracked two sets of engram cells, each tied to a different memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that when one set of cells was reactivated, the other set sometimes lit up too, as if the memories had become linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea runs counter to the old notion that an individual neuron stores an entire memory. Instead, the memory might be in the connections these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-rewires-the-brain-to-strengthen-memories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; build and reshape over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such structural rearrangements help us handle new information without losing old experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-brain-cells-store-memories"&gt;Which brain cells store memories?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memory engram cells are groups of brain cells that, activated by specific experiences, change themselves to incorporate and thereby hold information in our brain,” said &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8365-2762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Clara Ortega-de San Luis&lt;/a&gt;, Postdoctoral Research Fellow and lead author on the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her colleagues monitored how similar or related memories were stored across different brain areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used genetic techniques to label neurons that fired for one event, then watched how those same &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smartphones-are-teaching-us-how-to-supercharge-our-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; responded to a second event that felt related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major clue came from measuring how well these labeled neurons made new links with cells that were tied to older, separate experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics, a method that turns cells on or off with light, let them test whether blocking these newly formed links disrupted the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-one-protein-shapes-memory"&gt;How one protein shapes memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A specific protein, &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0520-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PSD-95&lt;/a&gt;, emerged as a gatekeeper of these engram cell connections. This protein sits at nerve cell junctions called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/24790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;synapses&lt;/a&gt; and helps anchor receptor molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team lowered the amount of PSD-95 in the neurons storing a given memory, these connections behaved differently. Under certain conditions, the memory seemed to linger even when researchers tried to dampen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That persistence hints at how the brain can hang on to memories that we might assume should fade. It also hints at why a shortage or disruption of PSD-95 could derail normal learning &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-memories-close-in-time-feel-connected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-cells-build-on-old-memories"&gt;Brain cells build on old memories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work taps into a broader shift in neuroscience. Rather than focusing on single cells, many researchers now examine how multiple cells form networks that hold our daily experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using cutting-edge genetic tagging, scientists can identify where new links are happening and whether these connections are essential for recalling the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forgetting-things-is-a-natural-part-of-the-memory-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the previous studies mapped separate steps: encoding a memory, storing it, then reactivating it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project took it one step further by showing how the brain might slot fresh information into an existing network, so the old memory is updated instead of replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-these-findings-matter"&gt;Why these findings matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have debated how new learning manages not to overwrite older memories in the same region of the brain. According to Dr. Ryan, “we should search for information ‘between’ cells.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This view suggests memories are not locked inside one specific location but scattered as connections that can be modified. If true, it may explain how we learn quickly from everyday life without dismantling what we already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies could one day target the proteins that enable these shifting connections. If molecules like PSD-95 shape synapses to store a memory, then changing them might help reframe harmful memories tied to fear or trauma, though more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-brain-cells-shape-daily-memory"&gt;How brain cells shape daily memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory isn’t purely academic. Our daily routines demand constant learning, whether it’s recalling names, navigating busy streets, or picking up a new hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain cells keep all that information flexible, yet stable, offers hope for tackling age-related memory issues or conditions that affect learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional work in the field has shown that certain neurons can take on multiple roles depending on the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those roles often shift over time, especially when new experiences pile up. By homing in on the connections, scientists add a piece to the puzzle of how these cells adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-this-research-could-lead"&gt;Where this research could lead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the complicated dance among engram cells might eventually guide how we teach, treat memory disorders, or support mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If wiring changes are at the core of learning, there might be clever ways to prompt healthy rearrangements in people struggling with conditions like post-traumatic stress or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study gives a peek into that process. It reveals a fragile, but critical, balance at the heart of learning: strengthen certain neural links for new knowledge, but keep enough structure so older skills and memories remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01512-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:23:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNYjY2WTNHQjBzSUJOSllETy10Zk1TMUlocWVyTW9tV184QlJYTHdxOTRubEFlNXhhRWJvd0Z5aGtqN29yeC1mTmVDRXNtdXUzS3AxYWtHN2NyaU94T0hHR2dMa2Z6cTBNOXAxTEVtSi1MSDFUdGFhY3ZSdmowMHM3aFpwTVAwVDRJbzFBY2RvMVdibXJ3YWxCZXhHN2ZpMmpfMVkxTw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists found an existing drug that turns human blood into mosquito poison - Boy Genius Report</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQQ1IxcDdjUnU1U25Hc1ltN0U1eE1NTjZhU2x5N3JuRkJBQkhlUHd1RV9hTE1EanJyck1RNW9YN2I3Z1N6VGJfamZoT1pVaUs2enJTdjdPSkI1T1pCdTBPbWFlWnBKTXJ6RHNieVI0LUpydTFLNm5lWWZVdTR1aEVWNFprUk52S1hfVkQ1UXk3SkZvSUpCcndMUEEwOXdlRlRnR3RKNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content no-dropcap"&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a surprising and potentially game-changing approach to stopping malaria that involves turning human blood into a death sentence for mosquitos. The secret lies in an existing drug called nitisinone, which, once ingested by the insects, kills them within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine discovered this effect by testing mosquitoes that fed on the blood of three people already taking nitisinone for a rare genetic condition. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr4827"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; were immediate. Every mosquito died within 12 hours, suggesting that the human blood they drank had become poison for them.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That alone could make this drug a novel tool in our ongoing fight against one of the deadliest diseases on Earth. Using other medicines to turn human blood into poison for mosquitos isn’t a new concept, either. Ivermectin, another medication, has been used experimentally to achieve a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nitisinone offers distinct advantages, the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077736"&gt;researchers say&lt;/a&gt;. It works faster, sticks around longer in the bloodstream, and doesn’t target the nervous system. This means it’s less likely to harm other insects like bees or butterflies. And that last point is extremely crucial in any large-scale rollout where environmental impact is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

The fact that the drug is already approved for use in humans speeds up the process of getting it into broader testing—possibly even mass drug administration programs if future studies support its safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are challenges. The ecological impact of long-term use of the drug to turn human blood to poison for mosquitos needs deeper study. Scientists also caution against underestimating the mosquito’s ability to adapt, as resistance to the drug is always a risk. Plus, public health programs would need careful design to avoid overuse and unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="Mosquito Bite" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5929362" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?quality=82 1600w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?resize=150%2C94&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?resize=1024%2C641&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?resize=1536%2C961&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?resize=160%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 160w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mosquito.jpg?resize=67%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 67w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;span class="image-meta block clearfix"&gt;&lt;span class="source right"&gt;Image source: corlaffra/Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the appeal is clear. Unlike spraying pesticides, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/scientists-invented-a-mosquito-repellent-that-lasts-for-over-a-week/"&gt;relying on mosquito deterrents&lt;/a&gt; and nets, or even &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/florida-mosquitoes-genetically-modified/"&gt;genetically modified mosquitos&lt;/a&gt; to help cull the population, this strategy flips the script entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of protecting humans from bites, it turns us into the danger. When a mosquito drinks from someone taking nitisinone, it’s not walking away, as human blood becomes poisonous for mosquitos when nitisinone is present.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future studies confirm what these early results suggest, nitisinone could redefine what it means to control mosquito populations by quietly turning to poison &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/mosquitoes-blood-taste-study/"&gt;the very thing mosquitos love&lt;/a&gt;: human blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third person in the remote California town of Mammoth Lakes has died of hantavirus, the sometimes-fatal illness that authorities say Betsy Arakawa, the wife of actor Gene Hackman, &lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/officials-to-give-update-on-gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-death-investigation-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;died of earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/monohealthdepartment/posts/pfbid0zW43aGawceHQdXW7VDi1HTPgyaTXSf8V5W1gaKam1YtJHT2FaLGLXmzRkDhWZ7rbl?__cft__[0]=AZV5uoqSXoyei-EN9EzNxlf3ZlmfcVqaD2E_auZIlaJKkXI5XFZnnXW8F1uiX7BLt1OqRI9uDTAiFIMWqg_8tH9YBhZSJNyyMkBmvT83wwkDCqkbghWOBOCtFfWgLxJsJ5PTTHXPhUR19Llc4AHNlBx3y13HW2ebKci22t_ZowWUFAXdWbAQxAulNAO2AmRu7FA&amp;amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; shared Thursday, Mono County Health &amp;amp; Human Services confirmed that a young adult had died from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus,” Dr. Tom Boo, the county’s public health officer said. “The home had no evidence of mouse activity. We observed some mice in the workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. We haven’t identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person’s exposure to mice or their droppings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="88fw2hsm" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5183395-gene-hackmans-wife-betsy-arakawa-died-from-hantavirus-but-what-is-it/?ipid=promo-link-block1"&gt;Hantavirus&lt;/a&gt;, found throughout the world, is spread by contact with rodents or their urine or feces. It does not spread between people. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chance of survival. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An infection can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,” said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “Early in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the CDC. All three deaths in Mono County were connected to this syndrome, which is spread by deer mice, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boo said deer mouse numbers are believed to be high this year in the Mammoth Lakes area, noting that “an increase in indoor mice elevates the risk of Hantavirus exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boo noted that of the three deaths reported in the county so far, they do not believe that any of them “engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead, these folks may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=160 160w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=256 256w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=320 320w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=640 640w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=876 876w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 876px" alt="" class="wp-image-3723328"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Color enhanced transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Hantavirus particles. (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the press release from Mono County Health &amp;amp; Human Services, all three residents began to feel ill in February. In all three cases, “there was some evidence of mice” in their workplaces “but no major infestations were found,” while one had “numerous mice in their home.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One person had been vacuuming “in one or more areas where investigators later found mouse droppings,” the department noted, adding that vacuuming “can aerosolize the virus through the air and lead to infection.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid the germ is to minimize contact with rodents and their droppings. Use protective gloves and a bleach solution for cleaning up rodent droppings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region — the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet. Ever since, the majority of U.S. cases have been reported in western states. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/data-research/cases/index.html"&gt;78 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in California between 1993 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-305934525" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While hantavirus is not uncommon in Mono County — there have been 27 cases reported since 1993 — cases are typically seen during late spring or summer, making the three cases reported already this year “strikingly unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior to the cases confirmed this year, Mono County had not seen a hantavirus infection since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus is not spread between people, health officials said. Roughly one-third of people who do become infected die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, New Mexico authorities confirmed that Arakawa — &lt;a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/search-warrant-reveals-details-surrounding-the-deaths-of-gene-hackman-his-wife-and-dog-in-santa-fe/"&gt;found dead in the home she shared with her husband&lt;/a&gt;, Hackman — had died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Authorities have not said how Arakawa, 65, may have become infected. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/u-s-world/judge-to-consider-request-to-withhold-investigation-records-related-to-deaths-of-gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa/"&gt;Investigators determined&lt;/a&gt; Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications of Alzheimer’s days after his wife died. Their dog, Zinna, was found dead of starvation and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A revolution is underway in gene editing—and at its forefront is David Liu, an American molecular biologist whose pioneering work is rewriting the building blocks of life with unprecedented precision.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A professor at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Liu was awarded a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences on Saturday for developing two transformative technologies: one already improving the lives of patients with severe genetic diseases, the other poised to reshape medicine in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke with AFP ahead of the Los Angeles ceremony for the prestigious Silicon Valley-founded award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will receive $3 million for his work on "base editing" and "prime editing," and plans to donate most of it to support his charitable foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ability to change a DNA sequence of our choosing into a new sequence of our choosing is a fundamentally very powerful capability," the 51-year-old said, foreseeing uses not just in human medicine but areas like developing more nutritious or disease-resistant crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Correcting the code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA is made up of four chemical "letters"—the nucleotide bases A, G, T and C. Mutations in this sequence cause thousands of human diseases, yet until recently, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/gene+editing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene editing&lt;/a&gt; could only fix a limited number of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even CRISPR-Cas9, the groundbreaking technology that earned a Nobel Prize in 2020, has major limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cuts both strands of the DNA helix, making it most useful to disrupt rather than correct genes, while the process can introduce new errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being able to use genome editing to treat genetic diseases requires, in most cases, ways to correct a DNA misspelling, not simply to disrupt a gene," Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That insight led his lab to develop base editing, which uses the Cas9 protein—disabled so it can no longer cut both DNA strands—to find a target DNA sequence and another enzyme to convert one letter to another—for example, C to T or G to A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversing the change—from T to C or A to G—was tougher. Liu's team overcame the challenge by engineering entirely new enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These base editors can now correct about 30% of the mutations that cause &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. The technology is already in at least 14 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of them, Beam Therapeutics—which Liu co-founded—announced it had treated patients of AATD, a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rare+genetic+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rare genetic disorder&lt;/a&gt; affecting the lungs and liver, with a single drug infusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional gene therapies often disrupt faulty genes or work around them, base editing repairs the mutation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was the first time that humans have corrected a mutation that causes a genetic disease in a patient," Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Cystic fibrosis hope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base editing, quickly dubbed "CRISPR 2.0," can't fix every mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 70% of the roughly 100,000 known disease-causing mutations remain out of its reach, including those caused by missing or extra letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expand the toolkit, Liu's lab introduced prime editing in 2019—a method capable of replacing entire sections of faulty DNA with corrected sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If CRISPR is like scissors that cut DNA, and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/base+editors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;base editors&lt;/a&gt; are like using a pencil to correct individual letters, then prime editing is the equivalent of a word processor's "find and replace" function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating this tool required a series of breakthroughs Liu's team describes as "small miracles." The result is, he said, "the most versatile way we know of to edit the human genome."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the targets Liu and his team have already pursued with prime editing: cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disease usually caused by three missing DNA letters that causes thick mucus buildup in the lungs and digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu's lab has made much of its work freely accessible, sharing DNA blueprints through a nonprofit library used by tens of thousands of labs worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The science we create—which is ultimately funded by society, through governments and donors—ultimately goes back to benefit society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's Breakthrough Prize awards come at a fraught moment for U.S. science, as President Donald Trump's government strips funding for institutions like the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The NIH is a treasure, not just for this country but for the world," said Liu. "Trying to dismantle the heart of what supports science in this country is like burning your seed corn."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An American neurologist and an Italian epidemiologist whose work revolutionized the treatment of multiple sclerosis on Saturday won a prestigious Breakthrough Prize, the award nicknamed the "Oscars of science."&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Stephen Hauser and Alberto Ascherio were recognized for their decades researching the debilitating neurodegenerative disease, which affects nearly three million people worldwide and was long considered an impenetrable enigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hauser's work on multiple sclerosis (MS) started more than 45 years ago, when he met a young patient named Andrea, "an extraordinarily talented young woman who was already an attorney" and working at the White House under then-president Jimmy Carter, he told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Then MS appeared in an explosive fashion and destroyed her life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I remember seeing her, unable to speak, paralyzed on the right side, unable to swallow, and soon, unable to breathe on her own, and I remember thinking that this was the most unfair thing I had ever seen in medicine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then 27 years old, he decided to make it his life's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rough road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the time, we had no treatments for MS. In fact, there was also a pessimism that treatments could ever be developed," said Hauser, now 74 and director of the neuroscience institute at the University of California San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists knew the disease, which damages the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/central+nervous+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and leads to paralyzing cognitive and motor problems, was caused by the immune system turning on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they thought the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/white+blood+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;white blood cells&lt;/a&gt; known as T cells were the lone culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hauser questioned that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying the role played in the disease by B cells, another type of white blood cell, he and his colleagues managed to recreate the damage MS causes to the human nervous system in small monkeys known as marmosets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US federal body overseeing medical research dismissed the link as "biologically implausible," and turned down their application for funding for a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hauser and his team pressed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They persuaded pharmaceutical company Genentech to back testing. In 2006, they got resounding results: treatments targeting B cells were associated with "a dramatic, more than 90% reduction in brain inflammation," Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was "something of a scope that had never been seen before."&lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;figcaption class="text-left text-darken text-truncate text-low-up mt-3"&gt;
                Italian epidemiologist Alberto Ascherio investigated why MS mostly affected people in the northern hemisphere.
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That threw open a door to bring new treatments to market that slow the advance of the disease in many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also raised other questions. For example, what would cause our white blood cells to turn against us?&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The virus connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a question that puzzled Ascherio, today a professor at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to investigate why MS mostly affected people in the northern hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The geographical distribution of MS was quite striking," he told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MS is very uncommon in tropical countries and near the equator."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made him wonder whether a virus could be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his team carried out a long-term study following millions of young US military recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly 20 years of research, they came up with an answer. In 2022, they confirmed a link between MS and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common infection responsible for another well-known disease, infectious mononucleosis, or mono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most people infected with EBV will never develop MS," said Ascherio, 72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everyone who develops MS has had EBV first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery still did not explain why MS occurs. But it fueled hope of finding new treatments and preventive measures for a disease that remains uncurable, and whose current treatments do not work on all patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascherio's breakthrough could also help treat other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now trying also to extend our investigation, to investigate the role of viral infection in other neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/amyotrophic+lateral+sclerosis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;," also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link remains theoretical for now. But "there is some evidence," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like where we were on MS 20 or 30 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;

The research tracked hundreds of middle school students in China and found that distinct patterns in how gratitude developed over time were closely linked with levels of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to explore a key question: How do changes in gratitude during middle school affect a young person’s mental health? While many previous studies have shown that gratitude and depression are related, most of that work relied on snapshots taken at a single point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few studies have looked at how gratitude changes during adolescence—a period of life marked by emotional growth, academic pressure, and social challenges. Even fewer have examined how self-esteem might influence the connection between gratitude and depression over time. The new study aimed to fill that gap by following students across three points over two years, beginning in eighth grade and ending in ninth grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As researchers in psychology, we were inspired to explore factors that could affect adolescent mental health,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liuyue-Huang" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Liuyue Huang&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher affiliated with the Department of Psychology and the Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, at the University of Macau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The emergence of positive psychology offered a valuable perspective, shifting the focus from merely treating mental illness to fostering strengths like gratitude. We saw gratitude as a promising, modifiable factor to enhance well-being and resilience during the critical developmental stage of adolescence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, supervised by Professor Peilian Chi, the researchers recruited 660 students from two middle schools in Guangzhou, China. Participants were around 13 years old at the start of the study. Of the original group, 564 students completed all three waves of data collection. At each point, students completed well-established questionnaires measuring their levels of gratitude, self-esteem, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gratitude was measured using a six-item scale that asked students how often they felt thankful for people and experiences in their lives. Self-esteem was assessed with the widely used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and depression symptoms were evaluated using a brief version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The researchers also collected information on students’ gender, age, and overall life satisfaction to account for these influences in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a statistical method designed to identify patterns of change over time, the researchers uncovered four distinct “trajectories” of gratitude. These groups differed both in the starting levels of gratitude and in how gratitude changed over the two-year span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest group (about 36 percent of participants) showed consistently low gratitude levels across all time points and was labeled the “low-gratitude-persistence” group. A second group, making up nearly 30 percent of students, started with high gratitude and continued to increase slightly over time—these students belonged to the “high-gratitude-increasing” group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group, comprising about 24 percent, started with high gratitude but showed a decline, labeled the “high-gratitude-declined” group. The final group, about 11 percent of participants, began with low gratitude but improved significantly by the end of the study—this was the “low-gratitude-improving” group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at how these patterns related to depression in the final year of middle school. They found that students in the two increasing-gratitude groups—both those who started high and increased, and those who started low but improved—reported significantly lower depression scores than students in the low-gratitude-persistence group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, students whose gratitude declined over time did not differ in depression levels from those with persistently low gratitude. This suggests that both the level and the direction of change in gratitude matter for adolescent mental health. Merely starting out with high gratitude did not protect students from depression if their gratitude declined during this critical period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that the ‘High-gratitude-declined’ group—those who started with high gratitude but saw it drop—didn’t show a lower risk of depression compared to the consistently low-gratitude group,” Huang told PsyPost. “This suggests that maintaining high or increasing gratitude over time might be more critical for mental health than just having high gratitude at one point, highlighting the importance of sustained positive development rather than a fixed state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem turned out to play a key role in these relationships. When researchers examined whether changes in self-esteem could explain the link between gratitude and depression, they found strong evidence that it did. Students whose gratitude improved—either from a high or low starting point—tended to show increases in self-esteem, which in turn predicted lower levels of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, once self-esteem was accounted for, the direct relationship between gratitude trajectory and depression disappeared, suggesting that gratitude protects against depression mainly by supporting adolescents’ self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that developing gratitude in adolescents can significantly lower the risk for depression, with self-esteem playing a key role in this process,” Huang explained. “For parents and educators, this means encouraging gratitude practices could be a practical and effective way to support adolescents’ mental health, especially during middle school years when emotional challenges often peak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support what psychologists call the “broaden-and-build” theory, which suggests that positive emotions like gratitude help people build psychological resources that can buffer them against stress and negative feelings. In this case, the resource being built is self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the researchers acknowledge several limitations. All data came from self-report questionnaires, which can be influenced by how participants interpret the questions or how they want to present themselves. The study focused only on students from a specific region in China, so the findings may not apply to adolescents in other cultural or educational contexts. Additionally, the researchers only examined one possible mechanism—self-esteem—leaving open the possibility that other psychological or environmental factors may also influence how gratitude affects depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study’s strengths—including its relatively large sample size, repeated measurements, and attention to patterns over time—make it an important contribution to understanding adolescent well-being. Future research could expand by including more diverse populations, exploring other potential mediators such as social support or coping skills, and testing interventions that directly aim to boost gratitude and self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d like to note that gratitude is a dynamic resource that can be cultivated with practice, and its benefits ripple through self-esteem to improve mental health,” Huang said. “We encourage readers to try small gratitude exercises with the teens in their lives, like keeping a gratitude journal, and to see this as a proactive step toward building resilience in a world full of challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2025.2469513" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sowing seeds of gratitude: the effect of the trajectories of Adolescents’ gratitude on depression and the mediating role of self-esteem&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Liuyue Huang, Shan Zhao, Yixiao Shi, Liutong Ou, Hongfei Du, and Peilian Chi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 16:14:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQUnV2WHE2RDNBaFdpaFVVUTlIRnpibXRVaGFOVmJ0WVVNZVRSTks1YUlKTFBrLTVpQjlQOUEtTThWNFJuaV84a1ZnWF9Lem5GS1gxeVVtbUtydENMbVRUVlRqb3hCVVRHMU54bzhjVHdfR0dkbHBDXzhIQV83bER2bGRla01CbWdWb0liWkZzREo4TTdhVHE5M1g3Nm0wWGhoREh2d3k0bGNQdEk</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover Mechanisms That Prevent Autoimmune Diseases and Win $600,000 Crafoord Prize - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxOb2pVNmJnbENuNGVXdGJVZ2M5aHJ5NE1SVzFvZU5GVVpSazR3UTg0RjAzTTYtSE01UlRhbkhiUVR0QTB1eDBqNzctdEVlcktBNjhuZ3lGVE1xWFR1ZGh5RktlSENMeWtsS05jZVI3QnlOQ3NOWnE1clloUVJfaTd6Z0RBNTJKcEl2STRSUUIxSng0WFoyZXA4RndDdHp2cTh0QmZ4WVNwSnVWZnVGa0xBVk4zY2JRNW53azZzYUxBWGI5TUgy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two researchers in the US and Australia have discovered important mechanisms that prevent B cells from attacking the body’s own tissues in autoimmune diseases like arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis—and in the process have won a prestigious prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the body’s immune system protects us from viruses, bacteria, and foreign substances. However, in autoimmune diseases, the immune system starts attacking tissues in the body instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers had long tried to discover the cause of autoimmune diseases. But, Christopher Goodnow and David Nemazee, independently of each other, adopted a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked why we do not all develop these diseases. Their focus was on B cells which, together with white blood cells and T cells, are the building blocks of our complex immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have given us a new and detailed understanding of the mechanisms that normally prevent faulty B cells from attacking tissues in the body, explaining why most of us are not affected by autoimmune diseases,” &lt;a href="https://www.kva.se/en/news/crafoord-prize-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says Olle Kämpe&lt;/a&gt;, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and chair of the Crafoord Prize committee that awarded the pair 6 million Swedish kronor ($600,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neutralize B cells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, physicians have started to experiment by using existing drugs to neutralize B cells for patients with severe autoimmune diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/exciting-new-car-t-cell-treatment-for-lupus-could-end-the-need-for-lifelong-medication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;including lupus&lt;/a&gt;, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, which has proven to be very effective at improving their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTO-IMMUNE RELATED&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Drinking Baking Soda Could Be Cheap, Safe Way to Combat Autoimmune Disease, Says Scientists" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/drinking-baking-soda-could-be-cheap-safe-way-to-combat-autoimmune-disease-says-scientists/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Drinking Baking Soda Could Be Cheap, Safe Way to Combat Autoimmune Disease, Says Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this year’s Crafoord Prize Laureates, we have gained fundamental new knowledge about what is happening in the immune system during autoimmune disease attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This also paves the way for development of new forms of therapies that eventually can cure these diseases—or might prevent them in the future,” said one professor of clinical immunology at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christopher Goodnow, the news of the Crafoord Prize came as a wonderful surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the most amazing phone call of my life!” said the Professor at the School of Biomedical Sciences’ Cellular Genomics Futures Institute at the University of New South Wales-Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m honored… and it’s also wonderful to share the prize with David Nemazee. We were friendly competitors working at different places in the world, and the two of us arrived at complementary answers at a time when most working in the field didn’t believe B cell tolerance was a thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTHRITIS HOPE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="New Nanoparticle Treatment Could Ease Arthritis Pain Following Breakthrough Research in Mice" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nanoparticle-treatment-eases-arthritis-pain-following-breakthrough-research-in-mice/" rel="bookmark"&gt;New Nanoparticle Treatment Could Ease Arthritis Pain Following Breakthrough Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He just didn’t have anything concrete to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Until recently, the answer was, ‘I don’t know,’ ” said Dr. Pastuszak, who is now a urologist at the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So he started looking for an answer. Cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational purposes in all but 11 states and was used at least once by 52.5 million Americans in 2021, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Yet because it remains illegal under federal law, it’s hard to study, and its long term health effects are still poorly understood, said Dr. Omer Raheem, a urologist at the Cleveland Clinic who practices in the United States and Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even so, when it comes to the male reproductive system, some effects of cannabis are becoming clear. By looking at 48 studies from around the world, Dr. Pastuszak &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7385722/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;found in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis products &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; harm a man’s chances of conceiving children.

The Hollywood star and his wife were found dead in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Feb. 26. While Hackman is believed to have died from “hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a significant contributory factor," his wife died from a rare illness. Arakawa, who was 65 years old, died from hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus, spread by rodents, can cause fatigue, fever, muscle aches, coughing and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In severe cases, like Arakawa's, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tragically, three people in the town of Mammoth Lakes, California have died from the same illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa during Gene Hackman Sighting at Spago - September 5, 1986 at Spago in West Hollywood, California, United States.

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are everywhere. They’ve been found in our brains, &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/microplastics-have-infected-critical-arctic-ice-algae/"&gt;algae in the Arctic ice&lt;/a&gt;, human placentas, beer, and breast milk—but now, according to one luxury clinic in London, they can be filtered out of your blood with a handy microplastic detox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the promise behind &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clarifyclinics.com/"&gt;Clarify Clinics&lt;/a&gt;, which offers an expensive service to remove microplastics from your blood. The treatment involves drawing blood, filtering the plasma through a proprietary system that claims to trap microplastics and other “toxins,” like forever chemicals, and then returning the filtered plasma to the body. The whole process takes about two hours and starts at a hefty £9,750 (roughly $12,600 USD).

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic’s founder, Yael Cohen, says many of their patients report better sleep, more energy, and sharper focus in the weeks following treatment. Some are dealing with chronic fatigue or long Covid. Others are just curious—or worried about their long-term health in a world where plastic pollution is inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="Man getting blood test preparation in clinic" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5879422" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?quality=82 1600w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;span class="image-meta block clearfix"&gt;&lt;span class="source right"&gt;Image source: Yakobchuk Olena/Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the buzz around microplastic detox therapy, the science remains unsettled. Microplastics have been detected in human arteries, &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/you-wont-believe-the-latest-place-they-found-microplastics/"&gt;testicles&lt;/a&gt;, and other places in the body. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;One 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; linked their presence in arteries to a higher risk of heart disease, but it didn’t establish a direct causal link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

But this treatment taps into a growing wellness trend: hyper-personalized, high-dollar biohacking for people trying to stay a step ahead of aging, pollution, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From stem cell infusions in the Bahamas to total plasma exchange popularized by longevity influencers, the market for speculative health treatments is booming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-startup-promises-to-clean-your-blood-of-microplastics-clarify-clinics/"&gt;Even Cohen acknowledges&lt;/a&gt; that more research is needed to prove the microplastic detox actually makes a difference. However, she points to her patients’ personal experiences—and her own improved sleep data—as early signs that this kind of detox could be doing something beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of her clients, the test results showing fewer plastic particles after treatment feel like proof enough. Still, there’s a key problem: measuring the amount of microplastics anywhere is notoriously difficult.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in tightly controlled labs, contamination is hard to avoid. The particles are tiny, cling to everything, and float in the air. A stray fiber from clothing can skew all the results of your microplastic detox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, detoxing your blood of microplastics might offer some peace of mind. Just know that when you’re dropping almost $13K on the treatment, there’s no scientific certainty that it’s actually doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

There are many 1-minute tests that have become popular of late from 'clubbing' to determine your lung cancer test, to the 'grip test' that could give you a peek into your expected life span. A swallow test is the latest on the block to help you find out your chances of getting certain types of deadly cancer. Let's know more about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in a study published in the journal Dysphagia in 2024, recommend this simple swallow test which could help uncover some of the deadly health conditions you may be suffering from, be it cancer, lung disease, dementia or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the team of Israeli medics, if a person is not able to swallow a certain number of times within 30 seconds, they may have a hidden deadly condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not being able to swallow comfortably may be caused by certain medications or a sign of acid reflux, but it may very well be indicative of certain types of deadly cancers, apart from serious lung disease, dementia or a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to perform the 1-minute swallow test&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple test can be performed at home and it's usually used to diagnose dysphagia, a problem associated with difficulty in swallowing foods or liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as the repetitive saliva swallow test, one needs to swallow as many times as possible in 30 seconds without the help of any food or drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli medics in the 2024 study mentioned the number of swallows people of different age groups should be able to achieve. Here's the list:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;20-39 age group: 8.5 times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;40s: 8 times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;50s: 7 times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;60s: 6.7 times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;70s: 6 times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;80s: 4.3 times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when you can't swallow as per your age group?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the sign that you need to meet your health expert to known the cause of dysphagia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the study was important as it displayed a much higher range of what should be considered healthy in comparison to previous studies. Earlier, the baseline was set as three for all adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding reinforces the necessity for a more comprehensive exploration of the validity of the established cutoff values within the oldest old age group," wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the person grows older, changes may occur in their throat muscles which could impact the number of swallows. The researchers also noted that men achieved more swallows than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden causes behind dysphagia or not able to swallow properly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dysphagia can be a symptom of certain cancers, specifically those affecting the head and neck and upper digestive tract, including cancers of the esophagus, throat, mouth, larynx, thyroid, salivary glands, and also some cancers in the stomach or pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NHS, dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, can cause various symptoms, including coughing or choking while eating or drinking, bringing food back up (sometimes through the nose), and a sensation of food being stuck in the throat or chest. People with dysphagia may also notice a gurgly, wet-sounding voice when eating or drinking, along with excessive drooling and difficulty chewing food. Over time, this condition can lead to more serious issues such as weight loss, dehydration, and repeated chest infections. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to speak with your GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How Important Is Genetic Testing In Detecting Cancers Early&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 14:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxNRkItMXQ4YmpldVU1RUZFRkZZemlvMGt0aU1zUHFtZjNRMjlvYVNrYTh3aDR4Q2VyQkNzdExxSjFJRWhNMmhsc05obV9zUEIxalBJYklSSXZzMG1kd21WUUk1NGlkRVJwMXFXdW5PRlUwRThqN3JDY2l6TXh3RGJRWUVqYWZ3cEMwdHJ4VWI3czFZdldrU0ZsSGJxZXhwRUhFZ1pjN0xyV1NKNW9xTzhFamJWY2FZMm9mRll2aGFpdlkwV1dvQThhc1hUcTVQeWlTNmxvbGRRZVJwaVVXcGh0MkxwbG16R1c1VzlabU9uVUhPSUxZMGRpaTZn0gH_AUFVX3lxTFBqdlBHV212UWotQlJjUW5pVWdDeGhMNm5hRnhGM3lPa0s3WTdBYkszdVlsVmdpNWRHRFFSZG04MkJUNzB2dERRRDZmZF9Xa0tqZHYzMV93UXVUdjVEajVuczlLa05GZTFEN1ZLaW9Wb3pUUXBydEV2TGhDUFBzckdNX2VhT1RCTk8ySWZkZVhmVFZvcER3OWpMaWNtcFNJbFJEMFNlczFTQWxZOG9XdG5NSTNGVzcwdUp0MDJJeDVNQTlRVi1CWjZkb3d5ZGxPdUpnaXZWTzFVMVlQWFh5Q0lCdVJGZWdlanZqdnVMbi02dTN0eXBaOWVNSmxjelgydw</guid></item><item><title>Device developed by Swindon hospital will give women more dignity - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1yRm9CS3l0STM1N0s4a1Y4cGhtWDE4NkNJN0RiREJIRk9iNF9SREtLVGwxMGpmd3hxTlZTOVhPLVUwS3ZmUWV5ZUNMLXQ4ZFV0dkRXWm91YXJaZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFBuRkNPTWpSUGItVkVJQWNfTUtEb1lKLXJzcUkzc19kSi1jNEl2V2dPb1pwTnBBdkVpOWlwQlBibGZtLVpHbW4wNUQtbnRNVGZRZmo0Y2tJbEIweXlUR2pV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;New device gives female patients more dignity&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/275c/live/6fba12e0-12ed-11f0-8bc5-d317b6dd5c85.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Great Western Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Three healthcare staff members in scrubs in a hospital corridor.

			&lt;p&gt;The benefits of getting fish in your diet are well known (it's in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), but &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; poisoning &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/mercury-in-fish"&gt;remains a concern&lt;/a&gt;. Now, scientists have figured out how to cut levels of &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; in fish by up to 35 percent with a tweak to how it's packaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and Chalmers University of Technology experimented with adding the amino acid cysteine to canned tuna – one of the types that can have &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mercury-in-tuna"&gt;the most mercury in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tuna is immersed in water containing cysteine, the novel solution removed 25 to 35 percent of the &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; from the fish, according to lab tests. The more fish flesh that was in contact with the solution, the more &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; was taken out into the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156736" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart.jpg" alt="Mercury chart" class="wp-image-156736 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart-511x415.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart-600x487.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156736" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tested different types of fish and different concentrations of cysteine. (Strachowski et al., &lt;em&gt;Global Challenges&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cysteine was picked for the solution because of the way &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; strongly binds to it – which is how it's able to build up in fish in the first place – and following on from a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2024.135562"&gt;previous study&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; removal by the same researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believed this would allow some of the &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; to be drawn out and instead bind to the solution and be discarded," &lt;a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/life-mercury-content-in-tuna-can-be-reduced-with-new-packaging-solution/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Przemysław Strachowski, from Chalmers University of Technology. "Further research is needed to take care of the removed &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been eating fish without any knowledge of any potential &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; contamination, don't worry: you're &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/11-things-people-think-are-terrible-for-your-diet-that-actually-aren-t"&gt;unlikely to be consuming enough&lt;/a&gt; of it for there to be a danger, though &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2024.135562"&gt;it's recommended&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women and young children only eat a limited amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nordic-diet-provides-health-benefits-even-without-weight-loss-blood-tests-show"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; of eating fish outweigh the potential health risks – though finding a way to reduce &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; levels in fish through the way the food is packaged would certainly &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1006876"&gt;reduce those risks&lt;/a&gt; even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of this type of packaging is that it is active while the product is on the shelf," &lt;a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/life-mercury-content-in-tuna-can-be-reduced-with-new-packaging-solution/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Strachowski. "No additional production steps would be needed if a method like this were used industrially."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The application of our results could increase the safety margin for fish consumption."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no noticeable changes in the appearance or smell of the fish samples treated with cysteine in the study, and &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; removal continued for up to two weeks. No extra additives were required for the solution to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's going to take further research to turn this into a practical option for fish storage, but the early signs are promising – and the team thinks the methods outlined could be improved in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that there are alternative approaches to addressing &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; contamination in tuna, rather than just limiting consumption," &lt;a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/life-mercury-content-in-tuna-can-be-reduced-with-new-packaging-solution/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; food scientist Mehdi Abdollahi, from Chalmers University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to improve food safety and contribute to enhanced human health, as well as to better utilize food that is currently under certain restrictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400161"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy, the nation’s health secretary, has faced intense criticism for his handling of the outbreak. A prominent vaccine skeptic, he has offered &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-vaccination-texas-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;muted support for vaccination&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;emphasized untested treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles, like cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;According to doctors in Texas, Mr. Kennedy’s endorsement of alternative treatments has contributed to patients delaying critical care and ingesting &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" title=""&gt;toxic levels&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts also fear that the Trump administration’s recent decisions to dismantle international public health safeguards and pull funding from local health departments have made &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/health/measles-outbreaks-texas-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;large, multistate outbreaks more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious pathogens. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room and spreads when a sick person breathes, coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Within a week or two of being exposed, those who are infected may develop a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Within a few days, a telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and torso to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In most cases, these symptoms resolve in a few weeks. But in rare cases, the virus causes pneumonia, making it difficult for patients, but especially children, to get oxygen into their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-5"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It may also cause brain swelling, which can leave lasting problems, like blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Symptoms such as memory loss are often misinterpreted as normal aging signs. However, your sleep patterns could also be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Society has explained that those suffering from dementia may encounter specific sleep-related issues. The charity stated on its website: “A person with dementia experiences physical changes in their brain because of their condition. These changes can affect how much, and how well they sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charity continued: “A person with dementia may have problems with sleeping at night, and may sleep more during the day. They may find it difficult to get to sleep or they may wake up in the night. The person you care for may not feel well rested when they wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, if these problems happen often, poor sleep may make the symptoms of dementia worse. You may find this difficult to cope with.For a person with dementia, getting enough sleep can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleeping well can be difficult for a person aged over 55, as the parts of the brain that control sleep may not work as well. An older person is likely to go to sleep earlier and may have difficulty sleeping through the night as much as they used to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the society, a person with dementia might:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have difficulty getting to sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wake up several times during the night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep less deeply&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep for less time overall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The society points out that a person with dementia might experience increased daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping at night. "This process can start to happen even before a person has dementia, or if they have mild cognitive impairment (MCI)," the charity noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study in the journal Neurology suggests that your sleep patterns could be an early indicator of dementia risk. The research indicates that individuals who feel excessively sleepy during the day and may indulge in "excessive" napping could face twice the likelihood of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this five-year study, 733 participants were divided into three distinct groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stable sleep (SS) - stable or slightly improved sleep, which 321 women (43.8%) demonstrated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Declining nighttime sleep (DNS) - decreases in nighttime sleep quality and duration, moderate increases in napping, and worsening circadian rest-activity rhythms (RARs), which 256 women (34.9%) demonstrated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing sleepiness (IS) - large increases in both daytime and nighttime sleep duration and quality, as well as worsening circadian RARs, which 156 women (21.3%) demonstrated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years, researchers assessed whether the participants had normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia, using various neuropsychological tests, physician diagnoses, or admission to residential nursing home care as benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among women in their 80s, 164 (22.4%) developed mild cognitive impairment and 93 (12.7%) went on to develop dementia. Notably, women categorized as having increasing sleepiness were found to have about double the risk of dementia compared to those with stable sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors concluded: "Among community-dwelling women in their 80s, those with increasing 24-hour sleepiness over five years had doubled dementia risk during that time. Change in multidimensional 24-hour sleep-wake activity may serve as an early marker or risk factor for dementia in oldest old women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research has shed light on the connection between sleep patterns and dementia risk. A 2016 study in the Alzheimer's and Dementia journal found that both too much and too little sleep could heighten the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthering these findings, a 2021 study published in Nature Communications revealed a link between shorter sleep duration in middle age and an increased risk of dementia. The NHS outlines several "common" early signs of dementia, emphasizing the importance of consulting with a doctor if you or someone you know is exhibiting symptoms of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQRHZqd0FqbFlWX3h0YW1LSHVNbFJvVGVWTkxLMVc4cU9XV1lraTZPUHF4eVdYMUY3OXdqNDhkeUJLNTZtSmRrZ2ZPcmtvNlRKeVd4eEN5c3o2RnNqR3g4dXpUWEJyN0pLSjZmUHpIcl93Yi00aTFvUGg5MUdPVWFHR1hGVWNnUk1QUFVoZjN5XzZSS0Q4WlA2akk3bjTSAaIBQVVfeXFMTk9uUXJmWDZldWpWMjJnZll4XzBBQmx0QU9OWFpOY3ZyU2kxVnU5TnpiSHBfbVpROXBvUkJXblZydXNtUHVQQm5CcVBybGpBWG5WY2NfX0FfcmdQcUc2NWhZd2N6TGZuNnN0SlBtcEFyRVluWkV0OTZYR3NHcDdZdmN6aWRZUFpoVF9xRTZRU1VZVWZFNmJOeHdqQzVIUmM3TnJ3</guid></item><item><title>Officials take action after 7,000 deaths were linked to same cause in their city: 'Major and emerging public health challenge' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOcGp3cWQzNkFwVWhiY2E2cnMtZXo0dl9BZU55NEczaHRnN3lfRTI4TzlkQkt1UWJXekNqR3BsTDh3OENLaHhkbW9FUDZrQTZRVHY0WWRBZHlvb1JEaVR2bEVGVEFMRWZ6ekF3Skk5MXJKSHFTLTI2eGVWT1V5bllCNm5n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid grid-cols-article-mobile md:max-w-[750px] md:grid-cols-article" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;The deployment of air quality sensors across the Ugandan city of Kampala is yielding results for residents, according to &lt;a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/news/ai-monitors-help-uganda-tackle-air-pollution-crisis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SciDev.net;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;SciDev.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Kampala suffers from some of the worst air quality in Africa.

However, the incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer (PAC) has &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542454824000109" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gradually increased;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;gradually increased&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades. “As women are having children at older ages, cancer diagnoses are becoming more common,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/elena-ratner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Elena Ratner;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Elena Ratner&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecologic oncologist at Yale Cancer Center, tells Yahoo Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, diagnosing cancer during pregnancy can be especially challenging, Ratner notes. “Imaging is more limited, and hormone levels during pregnancy can make breasts feel lumpy,” she explains. “Women commonly feel fatigued during pregnancy, which can mask symptoms of cancers like leukemia or lymphoma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pregnancy also makes cancer treatment complex and highly individualized, Cohen says. “It’s the patient’s journey,” he says, emphasizing the need to consider the wishes of the mother and her loved ones. Decisions are made by weighing risks to both mother and baby, factoring in the cancer diagnosis, gestational age and concerns about the cancer’s spread. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s a situation that forces women to navigate the challenges of cancer during one of the most joyful, yet vulnerable, times of their lives. It’s also something the women below — all of them now cancer-free — have experienced firsthand. Here’s what it’s like to be diagnosed while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-was-very-focused-on-what-everything-would-mean-for-the-baby"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I was very focused on what everything would mean for the baby’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laura Pearson was pregnant with her second child when she discovered a pea-size lump in her breast on the day of her 20-week routine scan. “I didn’t have any pain or anything obvious other than the lump,” Pearson, who lives in the U.K., tells Yahoo Life. But a subsequent ultrasound and biopsy confirmed that the then 35-year-old had breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Being pregnant meant considering her treatment options carefully. “The hardest part was weighing the risk to my baby with the risk of not treating the cancer right away,” she says. Doctors made the decision to perform a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/happens-during-lumpectomy-130000529.html" data-ylk="slk:lumpectomy;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;lumpectomy&lt;/a&gt; while Pearson was still pregnant, but chemotherapy would have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think the whole experience [of having cancer] was so tied up with being pregnant because all the decisions were based on that, and I was very focused on what everything would mean for the baby,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors ended up deciding to induce Pearson’s labor early at 35 weeks; she started chemo when her daughter was a week old. The birth of her daughter, though joyous, marked the beginning of a new chapter in her fight against cancer. “I was quite lucky with how I dealt with chemo. Most of the time, I was still able to look after my toddler and newborn during the treatment,” she says, adding that her husband took on much of the nighttime care. “I wasn’t allowed to breastfeed, which had the advantage that anyone could help out by feeding the baby in the night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pearson, now 44, drew strength from her support system. “You go into a sort of autopilot, I think. You get on with things and carry on because you have to, especially if you have another child already, as I did,” she says. The emotional strain, however, was hard to ignore. “It’s hard to talk about your fears of dying and leaving your children behind with the people who love you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-didnt-want-to-bond-with-the-baby-because-i-didnt-think-i-would-ever-meet-him"&gt;‘I didn’t want to bond with the baby because I didn’t think I would ever meet him’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, Emily Dilger from New York was 14 weeks pregnant and caring for her 2-year-old when she began struggling to breathe. She was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, but, she tells Yahoo Life, “I never seemed to get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After multiple visits to the doctor, Dilger was told her symptoms were just part of the pneumonia healing process. But 22 weeks into her pregnancy, she insisted on a chest X-ray, which revealed a mass between her heart and lungs. The following week, she was diagnosed with&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24405-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt; large B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Honestly, I didn’t think I was going to survive,” Dilger says. “I was tired and scared. It felt very lonely. I didn’t want to bond with the baby because I didn’t think I would ever meet him or live long enough for him to remember me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlike Pearson, Dilger began chemotherapy quickly, which meant she had to stop breastfeeding her toddler; the treatments also took a toll and made it difficult to care for her family. “I was really sick. I would cough so hard I’d throw up every single day,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At 32 weeks, she developed &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21637-hellp-syndrome" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HELLP syndrome;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;HELLP syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a rare pregnancy complication that can cause sharp abdominal pain, headache and blurred vision, and was transferred by ambulance to Rochester, N.Y., where she delivered her baby prematurely. “He was so tiny,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sharing her experiences on social media helped, however. She also has a new perspective on life these days. Says Dilger: “Walking out of the hospital after I was diagnosed, I looked at flowers differently. I’m so thankful I’m alive to see them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="every-morning-i-felt-like-i-was-waking-up-in-a-bad-dream"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Every morning, I felt like I was waking up in a bad dream’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Katie Wolf’s breast cancer journey began with months of reassurance from doctors that the lump she discovered early in her second pregnancy was nothing to worry about. “I felt the lump while breastfeeding my son, who was about a year and a half [old] at the time,” she tells Yahoo Life. Initially, her ob-gyn believed it was just a cyst or &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15690-fibroadenomas-of-the-breast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fibroadenoma;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fibroadenoma&lt;/a&gt;, likely caused by the hormones from breastfeeding and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But after she moved to her hometown and joined a local midwifery practice, Wolf’s concerns persisted. “I had weaned my son by that point, and it still hadn’t gone away,” she says. The midwifery practice sent her for an ultrasound, and despite the radiologist’s initial lack of concern, a biopsy was recommended to “rule everything out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soon after, at 24 weeks pregnant, Wolf received the news: She had breast cancer. The tumor was aggressive, hormone-negative and at least stage II, measuring nearly 5 cm. The surgeon who delivered the results made it clear that her pregnancy limited her treatment options. “Every morning, I felt like I was waking up in a bad dream,” she says of that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolf underwent six rounds of chemo while pregnant, battling extreme fatigue and anemia and requiring multiple blood transfusions. “I was so focused on trying to survive that I would sometimes forget I was even pregnant ... until I felt a kick,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While her baby thrived, Wolf struggled to gain weight. She switched to a high-risk ob-gyn in Boston, who collaborated with her oncologist. Together, they decided to induce labor at 37 weeks. After a break to regain strength after giving birth, Wolf resumed treatment nine days postpartum, now incorporating a new chemotherapy drug and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolf began to feel physically better after birth, but the struggle was far from over. “It was one foot in front of the other every day,” she says. After a further 10 rounds of chemo, she was declared cancer-free, a milestone she marked just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolf is grateful to now be raising two small boys as a cancer survivor. “I gained a new appreciation for my body, and my perspective on life will forever be changed,” she says. “I know my story could have gone very differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="it-was-a-constant-mental-battle-between-preparing-for-labor-and-preparing-for-a-fight-i-wasnt-ready-for"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘It was a constant mental battle between preparing for labor and preparing for a fight I wasn’t ready for’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At her 20-week ultrasound, Inga Cushman’s doctors noticed that the ventricles in her unborn daughter’s brain were larger than expected. This concern led to multiple ultrasounds and a fetal MRI. “That’s when the pediatric neurosurgeon also had the opportunity to tell me they caught a glimpse of a tumor on my kidney,” Cushman tells Yahoo Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The discovery of the tumor was a complete surprise. “I didn’t have any symptoms,” Cushman says. “It was just a fluke, a note on an MRI that was more focused on my daughter.” Meanwhile, it was determined that her baby had &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydrocephalus/symptoms-causes/syc-20373604" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hydrocephalus;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;hydrocephalus&lt;/a&gt;, or a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was a constant mental battle between preparing for labor and preparing for a fight I wasn’t ready for,” the Wisconsin mom of two says of her family’s dueling health scares. After giving birth via C-section, Cushman underwent a biopsy that confirmed she had &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24906-renal-cell-carcinoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:renal cell carcinoma;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;renal cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. “I was in the hospital dealing with the tumor while my husband was in another hospital supporting our newborn through her own hospital stay. At the same time, our older daughter and two dogs were at home, all needing care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cushman’s recommended treatment was surgery to remove the tumor while preserving her kidney. “Luckily, as odd as it is to say in a cancer story, I didn’t have to have any additional chemo or treatment. It was just the surgery that needed to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But just a week before Cushman’s scheduled surgery, her newborn, who she named Diana, had complications due to her condition; doctors said she needed surgery to have a shunt placed in her brain to drain the excess fluid. This added a two-week hospital stay for Diana, which overlapped with Cushman’s own surgery, complicating their already stressful situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cushman had follow-up CT scans for the next few years to monitor for any recurrence of her cancer. Navigating that uncertainty along with Diana’s own health needs has been tough, but Cushman understands all too well that it was her daughter’s diagnosis that led to her own health issue being caught. “There wasn’t any inclination that something was wrong in my body, other than I was growing a child,” she says of her lack of symptoms. She adds: “If [Diana] wouldn’t have had her challenges, I don’t know where we would be right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-expectant-mothers-can-do"&gt;What expectant mothers can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While my goal is to treat cancer, I know, more importantly, our goal should be to &lt;em&gt;prevent &lt;/em&gt;cancer,” says Cohen.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;aorta&lt;/strong&gt;, a large &lt;strong&gt;blood vessel&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for transporting &lt;strong&gt;oxygenated blood&lt;/strong&gt; from the heart to the rest of the body, plays a crucial role in our &lt;strong&gt;circulatory system&lt;/strong&gt;. While it has long been known that the aorta has &lt;strong&gt;elastic properties&lt;/strong&gt; that help absorb &lt;strong&gt;pressure variations&lt;/strong&gt;, recent research reveals that the aorta’s role extends beyond this passive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;New findings suggest that the aorta actively assists the heart by generating a &lt;strong&gt;wave-pumping effect&lt;/strong&gt;, providing crucial support for &lt;strong&gt;blood circulation&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in individuals with heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discovering the Aortic Wave-Pumping Effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the&lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of The Royal Society Interface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, delves into a remarkable discovery that the aorta can function much like a &lt;strong&gt;secondary heart&lt;/strong&gt;, assisting the primary heart in pumping &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon, known as “&lt;strong&gt;wave-pumping&lt;/strong&gt;,” occurs when the aorta stretches and recoils in response to the heart’s contraction and relaxation cycles. Researchers suggest that this process, which was initially observed in the &lt;strong&gt;embryonic stages&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;blood circulation&lt;/strong&gt;, may persist into adulthood, playing a vital role in &lt;strong&gt;blood flow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers used magnetic resonance imaging &lt;strong&gt;(MRI) &lt;/strong&gt;to monitor the movement of the aorta in 159 participants, including those with heart &lt;strong&gt;failure&lt;/strong&gt;. Their results highlighted a significant difference in the &lt;strong&gt;aortic displacement profiles&lt;/strong&gt; between healthy individuals and heart failure patients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The healthy group exhibited greater aortic stretching, which was less pronounced in those with heart &lt;strong&gt;failure&lt;/strong&gt;. This provides further evidence that the aorta’s stretch and recoil could help enhance circulation when the &lt;strong&gt;heart’s&lt;/strong&gt; pumping capacity is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mechanics of Aortic Stretch and Recoil&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="gb-container gb-container-c6586980"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aortic wave-pumping, or “i&lt;strong&gt;mpedance pumping&lt;/strong&gt;,” relies on the aorta’s ability to store and release &lt;strong&gt;energy&lt;/strong&gt; during the &lt;strong&gt;cardiac cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. During the heart’s contraction &lt;strong&gt;(systole)&lt;/strong&gt;, the aorta stretches as blood is pushed into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, during relaxation &lt;strong&gt;(diastole),&lt;/strong&gt; the aorta recoils, releasing the&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/atomic-collisions-unleash-energy-bursts/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81309" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; stored energy &lt;/a&gt;and helping maintain &lt;strong&gt;blood flow&lt;/strong&gt;. This wave-pumping effect works in tandem with the heart’s pumping mechanism, assisting the overall circulation without the need for additional heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery is significant as it unveils a previously underappreciated aspect of aortic function. The study suggests that this wave-pumping effect could become an essential mechanism, especially in those suffering from heart failure, where the heart’s ability to pump blood is reduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The aorta’s contribution to circulation could alleviate some of the burden placed on the heart, supporting the flow of &lt;strong&gt;oxygenated blood&lt;/strong&gt; through the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Implications for Heart Failure Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of these findings could be profound for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/doctors-say-the-heart-might-be-able-to-heal-itself-but-what-does-that-mean-for-heart-failure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="74582" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. As the aorta plays a supplementary role in &lt;strong&gt;blood circulation&lt;/strong&gt;, its function could be targeted in therapies aimed at reducing the strain on the heart. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are exploring potential treatments to enhance the &lt;strong&gt;elasticity&lt;/strong&gt; of the aorta, which could help support circulation in patients with &lt;strong&gt;heart failure&lt;/strong&gt;. Some existing antihypertensive medications already work to modify &lt;strong&gt;arterial stiffness&lt;/strong&gt;, but their effect on the aorta’s wave-pumping mechanism remains an area for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study could also explain why some individuals with weakened hearts can still maintain adequate blood circulation. The aorta may compensate for the heart’s decreased ability to pump &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that the body continues to receive the necessary &lt;strong&gt;oxygen&lt;/strong&gt; and nutrients. U&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;nderstanding the wave-pumping effect of the aorta offers new hope for improving heart &lt;strong&gt;failure management&lt;/strong&gt; and could lead to the development of more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
