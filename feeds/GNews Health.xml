They can last minutes to hours to days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“However, the emotional residue — feelings of shame, exhaustion or isolation — can linger longer, reinforcing a sense of helplessness if the cycle repeats,” Shields added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is similar to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anxiety-panic-attack-hungover_l_62bde9d7e4b00a9334e5ac5e" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="feeling “hungover” after an anxiety or panic attack" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="62bde9d7e4b00a9334e5ac5e" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;feeling “hungover” after an anxiety or panic attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These clinicians said you may be experiencing a depression attack if you:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel overwhelmed by sadness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Have intrusive, self-critical thoughts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience a strong urge to withdraw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel as though you’re having an emotional collapse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel a sense of fatigue, heaviness or a suffocating sense of hopelessness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Have a low mood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are apathetic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel disconnected from yourself or your life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience irritability or anger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel worthless or empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can’t enjoy activities you typically enjoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s important to add that depression attacks don’t solely affect a person mentally or emotionally. Many folks — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://stockton.edu/social-behavioral-sciences/documents/Kalibatseva1.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="especially those of Asian descent" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://stockton.edu/social-behavioral-sciences/documents/Kalibatseva1.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;especially those of Asian descent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; — experience somatic symptoms such as headaches, stomach pain, sleep difficulties and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Therapy is an effective way to improve your mental health.

This is not to make you feel hopeless but to adjust your expectations and help you give yourself grace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In many instances, depression is a system shutdown following a period of overwhelm that allows your brain and body to reset and regenerate ― even though it feels terrible while it is happening,” Amorosi explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the same time, some steps can lessen the likelihood:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the early warning signs and get proactive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Being able to recognize that a depression attack is coming — to the extent you’re able to — can be super helpful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few early signs include mood dips, increased self-criticism and a desire to withdraw, according to Shields. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Tracking these patterns through journaling or mindful check-ins can help you intervene early,” she said. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anxiety-hack-soften-gaze-calming-effect_l_664f4db1e4b042129b89d6a6" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Small grounding techniques" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="664f4db1e4b042129b89d6a6" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Small grounding techniques&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, such as changing your environment or engaging in self-soothing activities, can prevent escalation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address unresolved emotional struggles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think about any underlying issues that may make you more likely to experience a depression attack. For example, maybe you need to work through a past trauma in therapy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many depression attacks stem from unprocessed emotions,” Shields said. To untangle them, she encouraged therapy, creative expression and reflective practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat yourself like you would on a sick day or day off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is another way to get on top of a depression attack before it comes. Amorosi encouraged sleeping and resting, feeding yourself well, maintaining hygiene practices, connecting with others and seeking out what feels good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If and when you experience a depression attack, you can manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Don’t panic,” Amorosi said. “You are still in control of yourself, you can still take care of yourself and you will feel better soon.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She and Shields shared their best tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simply calling a depression attack what it is (with self-compassion) can make a difference. According to Shields, it creates psychological distance and is a way to remind yourself it’s temporary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage your body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Depression attacks cause a “freeze” response, Shields said, making us want to not move. But as you may have heard, activation is often needed before motivation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shields recommended gentle movement (like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hip-flexor-stretch-aging_l_66a8fa85e4b0a3cd43f74797" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="stretching" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66a8fa85e4b0a3cd43f74797" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;stretching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, going outside, taking a deep breath or running your hands under warm water) to get your nervous system out of this mode.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek connection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another unhelpful temptation that often comes with bouts of depression is isolation. You can get out of that rut with even a small act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If speaking feels too difficult, having a pre-written text, like ‘I’m struggling — can you check in?’ can make reaching out easier in the moment,” Shields said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize routines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your brain loves consistency.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When doctors suspect Alzheimer's, they can order a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/02/g-s1-14852/alzheimers-new-blood-tests-amyloid-tau-ptau217-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;blood test &lt;/a&gt;to learn whether a patient's brain contains the sticky amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the results of that test won't tell the whole story, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Randall Bateman&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People can have a head full of amyloid, but no dementia or memory loss," Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So he and a team of scientists have developed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank"&gt;a new blood test&lt;/a&gt; that can show whether Alzheimer's has actually begun to affect a person's thinking and memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It joins &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2" target="_blank"&gt;another new test&lt;/a&gt;, this one of spinal fluid, that can predict whether the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's are likely to affect cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a strong indicator of memory impairment," says &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/tony-wyss-coray" target="_blank"&gt;Tony Wyss-Coray&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Both tests, described in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, could help doctors identify patients who are likely to benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/1235624349/drug-alzheimers-patient-medication-perspective" target="_blank"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; that can clear the brain of amyloid plaques. Both were developed with funding from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Looking beyond amyloid&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The blood test is the result of a search for better Alzheimer's biomarkers — measurable substances in the body that indicate the presence of a disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bateman and his team had been studying tau tangles, the abnormal clumps of protein that form inside the neurons of people with Alzheimer's. These tangles are considered a hallmark of the disease, along with amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team noticed that one region of the tau protein seemed to play a critical role in damaging neurons and causing memory loss. And they found a biomarker for this region called MTBR-tau243.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Compared with biomarkers of amyloid plaques, MTBR-tau243 "was much more related to memory loss, symptom onset, dementia stage, all the things that patients care about," Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the team had to use spinal fluid to reliably measure levels of the new biomarker. But eventually, they developed a test that could use blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The blood test indicates how much abnormal tau is in a patient's brain, Bateman says, "and it only goes up when people are symptomatic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the test becomes available commercially, Bateman says, it will give doctors a fast and easy way to tell whether the amyloid plaques sitting in a patient's brain are actually affecting their memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It will also indicate whether Alzheimer's has progressed past the point where drug treatment is likely to help, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We can now make a much more informed choice about: How much benefit are you likely to get if you undergo a treatment to remove the amyloid plaques?" Bateman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A measure of synapses&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another new test, this one of spinal fluid, comes from a team led by Wyss-Coray of Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says they set out to answer a simple question related to aging: "Can we find proteins that change if a person's memory is not working well?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The team studied more than 7,000 proteins in the spinal fluid of more than 3,000 people. Two proteins emerged as potential biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Levels of one protein rose dramatically in people with memory problems, while levels of the other fell sharply.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So we made a ratio between the two, and that ratio turns out to be a very good indicator of whether a person's memory is OK or not," Wyss-Coray says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The ratio also could be used to predict eventual memory loss in people who have a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, [the ratio] goes up 10 to 20 years before they get the actual disease diagnosis," Wyss-Coray says, because that's when the first subtle signs of cognitive impairment appear.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both proteins in the test are involved in regulating synapses, the connections between neurons, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/paul-f-worley/2777288" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Worley&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. So it makes sense that levels of these proteins change when Alzheimer's begins to affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The exciting thing here is that this is a process that seems to anticipate the development of cognitive decline 10, 20, 30 years later," Worley says. That means it should be possible to start treatment long before symptoms of Alzheimer's start to appear, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Worley was part of a team that &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/23798" target="_blank"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; how the loss of one of the two proteins used in the test disrupts synapses and leads to memory loss in Alzheimer's. His team also found that people could remain cognitively normal despite amyloid plaques so long as their brains had normal levels of this protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The importance of synapses in Alzheimer's suggests that preserving their function — perhaps by increasing levels of this protein — could be one way to treat or prevent the disease, Worley says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fundamental biology supports that," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art King knows egg prices nationally have been on a roller coaster ride. They still cost an average of almost three times what they did in July 2023, but not at his farm market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As co-owner of Harvest Valley Farms in West Deer, King has been selling eggs for about $6 per dozen for years, and his prices haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attributes it to producing some of the eggs at his own farm and buying the rest from another small local farm, not a large national egg producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this has made his prices more competitive with the national average of about $5.90 per dozen, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, King says it also affords some protection from the biggest cause of higher egg prices: avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, smaller farms say they’ve been a beneficiary of rising egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small egg producers don’t have giant flocks of chickens concentrated in pens. Most boast free-range, or at least pasture-fed hens, making them less susceptible to a widespread flu outbreak. Egg shortages — caused largely by the killing of entire flocks where the flu is detected — has had less of an effect on smaller producers so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a simple lesson of economics: when the supply goes down, the price goes up,” King said of the national prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much the same formula at Nature’s Grove Farm near Latrobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Vlcek, Nature’s Grove co-owner, has kept prices steady, even prior to the pandemic, by joining forces with other local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We partner with a local Amish farmer who we have known for years, and he grows his own organic grains. He does not source them from another country; we don’t need to worry about the price of pesticides going up. It’s a fairly steady price from year to year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when we are not dependent on government subsidized crops or chemical fertilizers, we are able to offer a true price for our eggs and meat, free from much of the influence of market swings,” Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek also attributes a lack of avian flu’s impact on good farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you cram 40,000 birds in a hen house, living on top of their own manure, stripped of any green grass, bugs and sunlight, and feed them a ration that is catered to either putting on muscle (for meat chickens) or increasing laying production instead of nutrition, you are putting all the pieces in place that create an immuno-suppressed animal … one dependent on pharmaceutical fixes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek doesn’t know of a single pasture-based operation that has suffered mass losses from avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nature’s Grove, chickens are raised in pastures and are moved around freely. From his experience, Vlcek has noted poultry that consume grass are far less susceptible to avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chlorophyll is one of nature’s best detoxes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Freehling Farms near Kittanning, where King gets many of his eggs, there is high demand. The family-owned and -operated poultry farm is seeing increased sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very busy with the increased demand for eggs and chickens. The number of calls, texts and messages that we are answering on a daily basis is the highest I’ve ever seen it,” owner Roger Freehling said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sell 500 to 600 dozen per week, amounting to 2,000 dozen per month from the farm’s 1,500 hens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Freehling’s, they mainly sell to local markets and smaller farms, such as Harvest Valley and Dilner Family Farms, also in West Deer. Freehling said his farm’s eggs have consistently sold for $4.99 per dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;A real threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding bird flu has required a few extra precautions, even for smaller producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freehling’s birds normally would spend warmer months in pastures, but keeping them away from wild birds — a prime source of avian flu — has required the use of pens, where the hens are housed “loosely,” not crowded together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very devastating infection and the widest infection in poultry,” said Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, chair of infectious diseases and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biosecurity measures, like washing shoes or tires before entering the chicken house and washing hands and wearing protective clothing, are the greatest defense against bird flu, Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter how big or small the farm is or number of flocks. The key is not lapsing on biosecurity. Anything they can do to prevent the virus from entering is the best weapon they have to save their flocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current strategy the U.S. uses to control bird flu is to kill an entire flock if the disease is detected, Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure is supposed to prevent the virus from spreading. Any flock within 5 kilometers of the flock that was destroyed has to undergo regular testing to make sure the infection hasn’t spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 and 2015, that method worked, and the virus went away. This time is different because the number of viral sources has increased, including animals that have fed on dead birds, and the disease spreading to dairy cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first infection in cattle was reported in March 2024 in Texas. Since then, the cases in dairy cattle have been increasing to several hundred, with the highest rates in California and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the number of hens killed that resulted in the loss of egg-laying stocks. Farmers are not able to immediately repopulate. Then, the new birds do not lay eggs immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a loss of productivity and production time,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freehling sees small farming as a way to avoid such shortages, “as long as it’s sustaining for the farmer to do so,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small operations don’t have the number of hens mass producers have, but they can be more adaptive with them to meet market demands or guard against infection spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Harvest Valley, there are 27 chickens, and no new chickens have come in for about six months — part of King’s care practices to avoid the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nature’s Grove, they cut back on their egg-laying hens, but plan to grow their flock this season, Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, King said, while egg prices are up, so are the prices for almost everything else. He doesn’t see the price of eggs as much different from the costs of other items from a consumer standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other items have increased, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, since 2019. Bread per pound has increased by about 51%, milk per gallon by about 40%, ground beef per pound by 53% and chicken per pound by 37%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to those items, he said, eggs aren’t all that expensive, especially when considering their high nutrient value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek said the shortage is less about prices and more about the deplorable treatment of animals that has led to the spread of the bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any time we demonize wildlife and do not stop to question how we raise the birds, it gives us reason to pause,” Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;

In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it "renewed" and "refreshed". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while skincare products often claim to be "probiotic", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as "cosmetics" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2v83r5wk" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;difficult to know&lt;/a&gt; how effective they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent," says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Most "probiotic" skincare products contain either &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/5/2/41" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; – nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/9/3/264" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;postbiotics&lt;/a&gt; – proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome," says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial "transplants".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process.

Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis.

Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://archive.ph/o/nHXVC/https:/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15405408" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;enzyme produced by bacteria such as &lt;i id="staphylococcus-thermophilus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus thermophilus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt – can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials – the gold standard of medical research – are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article-abstract/182/1/39/6731363" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;conducted to date&lt;/a&gt; and concluded that while "oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Gallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's moving in the right direction," he says. "We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us.

or other causes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Working out for merely two days a week may be enough to keep cancerous tumors and heart diseases at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, divided nearly 100,000 people from the UK 37 to 73 years old into three groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The groups included 'active weekend warriors' - people who completed most of their exercise in one or two days; 'active regulars' - those who spread their activity throughout the week and lastly 'inactives' - participants who did not complete 150 minutes of weekly activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then analyzed seven days worth of physical activity captured by their accelerometer (a device that measures movement), as well as health-related statistics from 2013 to 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The accelerometers captured a range of activities, including walking, jogging, stationary cycling, elliptical exercises, household chores, gardening and leisure activities such as dancing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the data, over 42 percent of participants were classified as weekend warriors, about 24 percent as active regulars and nearly 34 percent as inactive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The collected data was then evaluated on how different physical activity patterns may affect the risk of dying from all causes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk for each condition was deduced using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision - a global system for medically coding causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to the inactive group, the weekend warrior and active regular groups had a significantly lower risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease and cancer if they completed 150 minutes of physical activity a week -  whether it was over two days or throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among participants in the active regular group, the risk of death from all causes was 26 percent lower; the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 24 percent lower and the risk of death from cancer was 13 percent lower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the conclusions, Dr Li added: 'This message is encouraging news for busy people who struggle to fit in daily workouts but can manage a concentrated burst of activity on weekends or over a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The research provides reassuring evidence that even sporadic physical activity can have lasting health benefits, making it easier for people to prioritize their well-being amid busy schedules.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;However, despite promising results about weekend workouts, it's important to be mindful of potential injury risks, especially if you haven't been active during the week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercising even twice a week can help strengthen the heart muscles, which improves their ability to pump blood efficiently and thus, lowers the possibility of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also prevent the body from developing type 2 diabetes, mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, arthritis and cancers including kidney, lung and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite promising results about weekend workouts, it's important to be mindful of potential injury risks, especially if you have not been active during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keith Diaz, a physiologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study, warns weekend warriors may be at a slight risk of musculoskeletal injuries and should practice good measures to prevent damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained in the agency's statement: 'One important caveat to remember is that trying to fit 150 minutes of exercise into just one or two days can be a lot on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some research suggests that weekend warriors have a slightly higher risk of musculoskeletal injuries compared to those who exercise more regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the benefits of exercising just on the weekend far outweigh the potential risks. If you are going to be a weekend warrior, make sure you do proper warm-ups and build up and progress to higher volumes of activity over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This will help to reduce your risk of injuries.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Now, scientists may have discovered a biological pathway for how this phenomenon could occur.

            The findings are based on mother-newborn pairs enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort between 2016 and 2018. In urine samples collected from 216 mothers between eight weeks and 14 weeks of gestation at visit one and 145 participants between 24 and 30 weeks’ gestation at visit two, the authors measured eight phthalate metabolites. Participants were around age 24 on average, and their levels of some phthalate metabolites were higher than the average determined by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Within a day or two of birth, the authors collected the babies’ blood via a heel stick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The team found prenatal phthalate levels were associated with lower levels of tyrosine, an amino acid and precursor to the thyroid hormone thyroxine. Thyroxine was also abnormally low in those with in utero phthalate exposure, and low thyroxine has been previously associated with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284" target="_blank"&gt;greater vulnerability to illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0083672905710049" target="_blank"&gt;neurodevelopmental issues&lt;/a&gt; in newborns, the authors said. Tyrosine is also a precursor to the neurotransmitters &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22588-dopamine-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22610-norepinephrine-noradrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;norepinephrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22611-epinephrine-adrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;epinephrine&lt;/a&gt;, all of which partly contribute to the body’s fight-or-flight response. Low levels of these neurotransmitters can lead to various problems, including anxiety, depression and trouble focusing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z9pev900013b6mfm3qj3jn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prenatal phthalate exposure was also linked with lower levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which converts into 5-hydroxytryptophan (or 5-HTP), which then turns into serotonin. Both 5-HTP and serotonin were also low. Serotonin has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin#:~:text=Serotonin%20plays%20several%20roles%20in,mania%20and%20other%20health%20conditions." target="_blank"&gt;several critical roles&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including mood regulation, sleep, learning, memory, digestion and the body’s response to stress. Previous research has linked low serotonin with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, sleep problems, and digestive issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000i3b6mxw72mdzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These biological changes generally were also linked to lower scores on tests measuring attention and excitability, or the ability to respond to stimuli, in participants’ newborns, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000j3b6m6regklcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polyvinyl chloride plastic, a primary use for phthalates, “continues to increase in use globally,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the New York University Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We know already — across not just brain development in babies, but a host of consequences that run from cradle to grave, and womb to tomb — that phthalates, in the form of (a) disease burden due to plastic, cost the US $250 billion annually.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000k3b6mg07dqzn2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study just adds to a voluminous base of evidence that chemicals used in plastic materials harm human health,” Trasande added. “It’s not really something that we should be debating more actively. The more thoughtful approach would be to actually discuss what we need to do about the use of plastic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000l3b6mcx2k780l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, said via email that its High Phthalates Panel is “dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DIDP and DINP.” Phthalates with a high molecular weight have seven or more carbon atoms. The study did not measure DIDP (diisodecyl) and DINP (diisononyl phthalate), but some of phthalates identified in the study were high phthalates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000m3b6m065568l7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study has a few important limitations, including the lack of information on participants’ diets or whether their births were vaginal or caesarean, all of which can significantly affect both phthalate exposure and a newborn’s metabolites, the authors said. Additionally, around 10% of participants reported using alcohol while pregnant, while 15% reported using tobacco and 40% reported using marijuana. There were no details collected on frequency, quantity or duration of use of those substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000n3b6mxi362f7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to environmental contaminants can also be influenced by psychological or social stressors, which the study couldn’t account for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000o3b6m59o2439u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sample size is small, of course, (but) it’s a complicated and expensive study to conduct in the first place,” Trasande said. “There may be multiple mechanisms by which phthalates disrupt brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000p3b6m5g222or4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people to be able to avoid exposure to phthalates and other chemicals, experts are calling on manufacturers and policymakers to change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000q3b6m53s4m2sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m part of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty (and we) are actually suggesting banning phthalates as a group because of their demonstrated toxicity and that they can cause effects at very low doses,” said ecotoxicologist Dr. Susanne Brander, associate professor in the department of fisheries, wildlife and conservation sciences at Oregon State University. Brander wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000r3b6mse6ilcva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some manufacturers are creating new plastic additives they hope are safer, but it’s possible they could be as problematic as what we’re using now, Trasande said. “The burden needs to be on the manufacturers to prove that materials … are proven safe before they’re used.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000s3b6mvywd83qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, people can reduce their exposure to phthalates by using glass, stainless steel or cast iron and not using nonstick cookware or microwaving or dishwashing plastic materials, Trasande said. “Microwave safe” means the container will be OK, not your food — since it can absorb microscopic particles, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000t3b6mwdqfsus7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When buying personal care products, look for those labeled “phthalate-free” and check ingredient lists, Liang said. Phthalates may be listed as DEP (diethyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate) or BBzP (butyl benzyl phthalate). You can use the Environmental Working Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/" target="_blank"&gt;SkinDeep database&lt;/a&gt; to check which chemicals a product may contain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000u3b6me2igy6tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Since phthalates can be found in household dust, improving air circulation and regular cleaning with a damp cloth can help,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            Phthalates — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;the synthetic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; used in everyday products for food packaging, personal care, toys and more — have been linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21854843/" target="_blank"&gt;abnormal neurological development&lt;/a&gt; in infants.

            Now, scientists may have discovered a biological pathway for how this phenomenon could occur.

            Prenatal phthalate exposure was also linked with lower levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which converts into 5-hydroxytryptophan (or 5-HTP), which then turns into serotonin. Both 5-HTP and serotonin were also low. Serotonin has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin#:~:text=Serotonin%20plays%20several%20roles%20in,mania%20and%20other%20health%20conditions." target="_blank"&gt;several critical roles&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including mood regulation, sleep, learning, memory, digestion and the body’s response to stress. Previous research has linked low serotonin with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, sleep problems, and digestive issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These biological changes generally were also linked to lower scores on tests measuring attention and excitability, or the ability to respond to stimuli, in participants’ newborns, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Polyvinyl chloride plastic, a primary use for phthalates, “continues to increase in use globally,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the New York University Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We know already — across not just brain development in babies, but a host of consequences that run from cradle to grave, and womb to tomb — that phthalates, in the form of (a) disease burden due to plastic, cost the US $250 billion annually.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000k3b6mg07dqzn2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study just adds to a voluminous base of evidence that chemicals used in plastic materials harm human health,” Trasande added. “It’s not really something that we should be debating more actively. The more thoughtful approach would be to actually discuss what we need to do about the use of plastic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000l3b6mcx2k780l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, said via email that its High Phthalates Panel is “dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DIDP and DINP.” Phthalates with a high molecular weight have seven or more carbon atoms. The study did not measure DIDP (diisodecyl) and DINP (diisononyl phthalate), but some of phthalates identified in the study were high phthalates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000m3b6m065568l7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study has a few important limitations, including the lack of information on participants’ diets or whether their births were vaginal or caesarean, all of which can significantly affect both phthalate exposure and a newborn’s metabolites, the authors said. Additionally, around 10% of participants reported using alcohol while pregnant, while 15% reported using tobacco and 40% reported using marijuana. There were no details collected on frequency, quantity or duration of use of those substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to environmental contaminants can also be influenced by psychological or social stressors, which the study couldn’t account for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000o3b6m59o2439u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sample size is small, of course, (but) it’s a complicated and expensive study to conduct in the first place,” Trasande said. “There may be multiple mechanisms by which phthalates disrupt brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000p3b6m5g222or4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people to be able to avoid exposure to phthalates and other chemicals, experts are calling on manufacturers and policymakers to change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000q3b6m53s4m2sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m part of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty (and we) are actually suggesting banning phthalates as a group because of their demonstrated toxicity and that they can cause effects at very low doses,” said ecotoxicologist Dr. Susanne Brander, associate professor in the department of fisheries, wildlife and conservation sciences at Oregon State University. Brander wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000r3b6mse6ilcva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some manufacturers are creating new plastic additives they hope are safer, but it’s possible they could be as problematic as what we’re using now, Trasande said. “The burden needs to be on the manufacturers to prove that materials … are proven safe before they’re used.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000s3b6mvywd83qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, people can reduce their exposure to phthalates by using glass, stainless steel or cast iron and not using nonstick cookware or microwaving or dishwashing plastic materials, Trasande said. “Microwave safe” means the container will be OK, not your food — since it can absorb microscopic particles, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000t3b6mwdqfsus7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When buying personal care products, look for those labeled “phthalate-free” and check ingredient lists, Liang said. Phthalates may be listed as DEP (diethyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate) or BBzP (butyl benzyl phthalate). You can use the Environmental Working Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/" target="_blank"&gt;SkinDeep database&lt;/a&gt; to check which chemicals a product may contain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000u3b6me2igy6tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Since phthalates can be found in household dust, improving air circulation and regular cleaning with a damp cloth can help,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Without insurance, he was hesitant to see a doctor, but when he did, he was shocked to learn that that persistent sore throat was actually cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p402_premium"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Squamous cell carcinoma they told me,” the Humboldt man said. “I couldn’t believe it. I was upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMFI_Article_300x250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lane, the cancer invaded his jaw, back of his tongue, his throat, and lymph nodes. He underwent six weeks of chemotherapy and seven weeks of radiation at the Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank God it’s over,” said Lane who had his last treatment on Dec.17, the 21st anniversary of his wife, Deb Stanberg Lane, passing from breast cancer. “That was a big day.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral, head, and neck cancers are twice as likely to be found in men than in women, though they are also diagnosed more often among people over the age of 50 than they are in younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="single_article_image_blur"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="caption"&gt;-Submitted photo
&lt;br&gt;
Rod Lane, of Humboldt, loves to ride his motorcycle but after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for squamous cell carcinoma, he sometimes feels that he doesn’t have the strength to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans don’t know the early symptoms of oral, head and neck cancer, and most symptoms are easy to ignore or go completely unnoticed,” said Dr. Sarah Tofilon, medical oncologist at McFarland Clinic, who also practices at UnityPoint Health – Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. “These cancers often go undiagnosed until the later stages, after it has begun to spread. It’s through routine medical or dental exams that early symptoms are often spotted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMFI_Article2_300x250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free screenings for oral, head and neck cancer will be provided from 3 to 6 p.m. April 17 at Iowa Central Community College’s Applied Science Technology building. Providers with UnityPoint Health — Norma Schmoker Cancer Center and the Iowa Central Community College Dental Hygiene program have partnered to provide the painless screenings at no charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had had screenings like this,” said Lane. “Get checked. Do the screening. I don’t want anyone to have to experience what I’ve gone through.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tofilon, every adult should be screened for oral,  head and neck cancer, especially tobacco and alcohol users as they tend to be at greatest risk. Medical research is also finding that throat cancer cases are on the rise in younger adults who do not smoke due to the increasing rate of infection with  human papillomavirus, a potentially cancer-causing infection. Nearly 70 percent of the cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed in the United States this year will be attributed to HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HPV-related throat cancer is more difficult to detect because it usually occurs on the back of the tongue or on the tonsils,” said  Tofilon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Rod Lane sits with his younger sister, Jody during one of his treatments at the Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. Lane was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 17 screenings are available at no cost, are painless, and take approximately 15 minutes. Appointments can be made by calling 515-574-6183. Walk-ins are also welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope everyone takes advantage of the screenings,” said Lane, who is anxiously awaiting results from his PET scan next week. Those results will determine if he is cancer-free or if the squamous cell carcinoma has metastasized. “Don’t wait until it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;

As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fermented-foods-for-brain-health-8729105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease. They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Review Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worth adding to your routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A2 kefir made from A2 milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:water kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry-Kefir Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ranch dressing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the MIND diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t great for your brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-alzheimers-study-11707164" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:05:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBmeHA0RE10NnZsRXdYRmZsTVpzdWdYZGdyTkJNUUpDNGFOSWk2X1ZNeEZjUksxX1B0NGhYeHoydXdnWUpZcTc1YXcwUlRhRHd6S045R2JVZ1RNUUNjSzhlOWZvZHZaR2c2MEJuTUxmellPUElHRUE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County records first measles case in 12 years - WOODTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNZVZBaGRyRVFzcEhackhHZU0wcDZBcUoybC1USEVDbllGVG41Q2pkQnBjYmtBNEw4eHFiTnlKVWQxWjBWMmxGOE5DUVY4cmpYczB0bnlvUWFxaG8yWXZlU3hTbXE1dC1ydkJVVHgySTE0ZUFGOVVEUUJLUmxxbWNtcmRwam9reXRuSnZkel9lR0NRYUtiRkHSAZsBQVVfeXFMUDVCSWVvRDQtVjRkNHpBMzc0TE0zLTdXRE1ZYk55MkdFQlFRLVA1ZGlDMGZmanlOMHJMUmdRZFZSTkwzWHNEaHNWWkd6TFZqQ096Uy1aVjBNeEF6TGM3MzUyZDF1TmdUZHNBWFlEVjdSbHpLd3RDWGdJUlZrNW5PeHlHbUdNNHh3TFNnclF3czg2TkN3R3d2d0p0TjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More than five years since COVID was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19"&gt;declared a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, we’re still facing the regular emergence of new variants of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest variant on the rise is LP.8.1. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;increasing in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, making up close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;one in five COVID cases&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere it’s become even more dominant, comprising at least three in five cases &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is LP.8.1? And is it cause for concern? Let’s look at what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An offshoot of Omicron&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LP.8.1 was first &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;detected in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a descendant of Omicron, specifically of KP.1.1.3, which is descended from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285"&gt;JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, a subvariant that caused large waves of COVID infections around the world in late 2023 and early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) designated LP.8.1 as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt; in January. This was in response to its significant growth globally, and reflects that it has genetic changes which may allow the virus to spread more easily and pose a greater risk to human health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, LP.8.1 has mutations at six locations in its spike protein, the protein which allows SARS-CoV-2 to attach to our cells. One of these mutations, V445R, is thought to allow this variant to spread more easily relative to other circulating variants. V445R has been shown to increase binding to human lung cells in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext"&gt;laboratory studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The proportion of COVID cases caused by LP.8.1 has been rising in New South Wales.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;NSW Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the symptoms of LP.8.1 don’t appear &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;to be any more severe&lt;/a&gt; than other circulating strains. And the WHO has evaluated the additional public health risk LP.8.1 poses at a global level to be low. What’s more, LP.8.1 remains a variant under monitoring, rather than a variant of interest or a variant of concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these changes to the virus with LP.8.1 are small, and not likely to make a big difference to the trajectory of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;That doesn’t mean cases won’t rise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID as a whole is still a major national and international health concern. So far this year there have been close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;45,000 new cases recorded in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, while around &lt;a href="https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-hospitalised/aus"&gt;260 people are currently in hospital&lt;/a&gt; with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because many people are no longer testing or reporting their infections, the real number of cases is probably far higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;COVID is still around.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/asian-traveler-business-man-wearing-face-1739402366"&gt;Hananeko_Studio/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, LP.8.1 has become the &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;third most dominant strain in NSW&lt;/a&gt; (behind &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/xec-is-now-in-australia-heres-what-we-know-about-this-hybrid-covid-variant-239292"&gt;XEC&lt;/a&gt; and KP.3). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;has been growing&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of months and this trend looks set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say it’s not growing similarly in other states and territories, however NSW Health publishes &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/reports.aspx"&gt;weekly respiratory surveillance&lt;/a&gt; with a breakdown of different COVID variants in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequences of LP.8.1 in the &lt;a href="https://gisaid.org/"&gt;GISAID database&lt;/a&gt;, used to track the prevalence of variants around the world, increased from &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;around 3%&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2024 to 38% of global sequences as of &lt;a href="https://x.com/Mike_Honey_/status/1905816340331728914"&gt;mid March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries it’s climbed particularly high. In the United States LP.8.1 is responsible for &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;55% of cases&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;, where LP.8.1 is making up at least 60% of cases, scientists fear &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/science/new-covid-wave-cases-hospitalisations-3611459?srsltid=AfmBOor_V7pQrPMPhUYQA2KCZgRfsI_CpxTwIRiHDFJHIJhq2kbAmD42"&gt;it may be driving a new wave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="BlueskyEmbed" data-react-props='{"uri":"at://did:plc:cyy3irakdgdbhcdtd4ik6aro/app.bsky.feed.post/3llmzuz457k2m"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will COVID vaccines work against LP.8.1?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current COVID vaccines, including the most recently available &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;JN.1 shots&lt;/a&gt;, are still expected to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;offer good protection&lt;/a&gt; against symptomatic and severe disease with LP.8.1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, due to its designation as a variant under monitoring, WHO member countries will continue to study the behaviour &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;of the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, including any potential capacity to evade our immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there’s no cause for panic due to LP.8.1 variant at this stage, COVID can still be a severe disease for some. Continued vigilance and vaccination, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;for medically vulnerable groups&lt;/a&gt;, is essential in minimising the impact of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But it’s not just a matter of getting enough rest. Sleeping late and less than five hours a day can impact your health in various ways. Dr Dheeraj Kapoor, head of endocrinology at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, tells Lata Mishra why getting your daily dose of shuteye is important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How does poor sleep affect metabolism and blood sugar regulation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation are two critical factors that contribute to conditions like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and fatty liver disease. Sleep deprivation, defined as getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep, and disrupted sleep quality, where a person frequently wakes up at night, both increase the risk of metabolic disorders. When sleep is compromised, the body produces excess cortisol, a stress hormone that heightens insulin resistance and increases the risk of diabetes. Additionally, hormonal imbalances occur — ghrelin (the hunger hormone) rises while leptin (which signals fullness) decreases, leading to increased appetite and cravings for high-calorie foods. Sleep deprivation also triggers inflammation and oxidative stress, further contributing to metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can just one night of poor sleep impact us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic sleep deprivation has a more profound impact, some studies indicate that even one night of poor sleep can elevate cortisol levels which, in turn, increases insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why is sleeping less than five hours and going to bed late harmful?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination disrupts the body’s circadian rhythm, the internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolic processes. When sleep duration is too short and occurs too late at night, cortisol production rises, insulin sensitivity decreases, and metabolic disorders become more likely. Night-shift workers and those who regularly stay up late are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome due to these disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;If someone gets eight-plus hours of sleep but goes to bed late, are they still at risk for metabolic issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. While getting adequate sleep is beneficial, the timing of sleep also matters. Sleeping after midnight disrupts the circadian rhythm which regulates physiological processes, including sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolism. It helps control insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. When disrupted — due to irregular sleep schedules, shift work, or sleeping late — metabolic processes get impaired, leading to increased risks of diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Do late sleepers tend to have poorer glucose control?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their disrupted circadian rhythms affect insulin function and glucose metabolism. They also tend to have irregular eating patterns, increased cravings for high-calorie foods, and higher cortisol levels, all of which contribute to poor glucose control. Night-time eating habits further exacerbate insulin resistance, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What about other disorders like PCOS, fatty liver disease, or high cholesterol? Are they caused by poor sleep too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Poor sleep affects hormone balance, leading to increased insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, which play key roles in conditions like PCOS, fatty liver disease, and high cholesterol. Sleep deprivation also promotes weight gain and inflammation, both of which contribute to these metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can exercise reduce the impact of sleep loss on insulin sensitivity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Exercise, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training, can help reduce some of the negative effects of sleep loss by improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function. However, exercise should ideally be done in the morning, afternoon, or early evening rather than right before bedtime, as late-night workouts can increase adenosine levels and interfere with sleep quality. Also, reducing screen time before bed and avoiding caffeinated drinks can further support better sleep quality and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why does caffeine consumption disrupt sleep more as we age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks adenosine, a chemical that promotes sleep. As individuals age, the body’s ability to metabolise caffeine slows down, making its effects last longer. Older adults are also more sensitive to sleep disturbances, meaning even a small amount of caffeine consumed in the evening can lead to prolonged wakefulness and fragmented sleep. Additionally, age-related changes in sleep patterns, such as lighter sleep and increased awakenings, make the effects of caffeine more pronounced. It is recommended that older adults reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening to improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are some effective strategies for improving sleep hygiene?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep hygiene involves adopting healthy habits that promote restful sleep. Some effective strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps regulate the body’s internal clock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a comfortable sleep environment: Keeping the bedroom dark, quiet, and cool can enhance sleep quality. Using blackout curtains, white noise machines, and comfortable bedding can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding stimulants before bedtime: Caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals should be avoided in the evening to prevent sleep disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in relaxation techniques: Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or light stretching before bed can help relax the mind and body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting regular physical activity: Exercising during the day promotes better sleep, but vigorous workouts should be avoided close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQMW1sWHdqSHdQNkNJT2JtMnI0Y1NwaDBnTDBFT08xOTFGWXVnTUZXX2lrVnIwR2tqMkhjN3gtYzZ2UUR3MzBrdGdnaEV3eWhaRUpXR0daT1B3ZXg0WFptcHhUSTBGMVhGak5zMEZqVklybVIwWXZycWhuMFFXRl9tcDQ0b05meThvQjNLSTd5MWFPQURvbDNValJNVmR2bWgtZTEtd2hXYllWaTNvanoyQUlqXzg0NHpURXJnV1Juak5EYWpwTVBsSV9pTDhoa3hDejBrQ3hlcUVxSjluN0F3Z1hVci1Ib0xMQjRiMDJtWTlKYUk4alE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County sees first measles case in over a decade, exposure locations and dates listed - WZZM13.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxOZ1hnaS1KZXVtcW1ORmNuRkFqOFhIb01zV0toRjRWZXVubnFBMF9jRlQzd1pQM1MxYnEwaW5BNlk0ekNZSTRsSXU0a2R5T0VTNUwxcHBsbjg0WXhCVjNsUW9DdC1FNEVvZjVkT203cE5YUWt2UnpXTVNCbDhMa1JaYTVmS3VWQWU5TU1nTUFXckttWGNfMlFfalFpUG5IZmRKV09RQ0M0eUZaRnBNTXBzZ1cxY0pWSFR2a3FtWlBibzFhRVc0bkRjNFdzaE9wS2ZrRVNHWllR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Kent County confirmed its first measles case in over a decade and listed times and places community members may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KENT COUNTY, Mich. — Kent County hasn't seen a case of seen a case of the measles since 2013, until now.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kent County Health Department said on Tuesday that in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, they confirmed a case of measles in a Kent County resident.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in Kent County is Michigan's second case this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease that continues to circulate both in the U.S. and globally," said Dr. Adam London, Health Officer at the KCHD. "This case is a reminder of how quickly measles can spread and the importance of vaccination. We urge residents to check their immunization status and to get vaccinated, especially if planning to travel internationally or into areas with active measles outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said that the infected person is an adult and had recently traveled abroad before returning to the U.S. and traveling between Michigan and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department listed the following locations where individuals may have been exposed on specific dates:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves, continuing to infect others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin 7-14 days after exposure, according to the health department, though they can surface as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department shared the following list of symptoms to watch for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104°F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of mouth (Koplik Spots) 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs 3-5 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department advised anyone who was at any of the above locations during the specified times should monitor for these symptoms for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged to call their healthcare provider before seeking in-person care to prevent further spread. The KCHD can be reached Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 616-632-7228. Individuals can call 2-1-1 for support during weekends and evenings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in young children, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems," said Dr. Kristin Oldenberg, Medical Director at KCHD. “Fortunately, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles. Two doses of the vaccine provide 97% protection against the disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study suggests that regularly consuming kefir may be beneficial for slowing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kefir is a versatile fermented food that you can drink by itself or use in recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More studies with humans should be done to know if kefir is safe and effective when consumed with drugs for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of all dementia cases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-review-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Review Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This was compared to those with levels above 3.4 mmol/L - the higher end of a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking statins saw those with LDL cholesterol levels below 1.8 mmol/L reduce their dementia risk by a further 13 per cent and 12 per cent for Alzheimer’s compared with people who do not take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings emphasise the importance of targeted LDL- C management as part of dementia prevention strategies, with potential integration into clinical guidelines,” the authors wrote in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results support the use of statin therapy within specific LDL- C ranges for both cardiovascular and cognitive health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deadly fungus is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/dangerous-fungus-spreading-in-us-hospitals-has-rapidly-increased/"&gt;spreading like crazy&lt;/a&gt; across the United States, sickening and killing hospital patients — and the federal response has been ineffectual at best.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been found in 29 states since 2016, including New York, and the increase in affected patients is soaring year by year, the American Journal of Infection Control has found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the drug-resistant Candida auris fungus an  “urgent” threat, but talk is cheap. The agency is largely to blame for its rapid spread.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a textbook example of a federal agency crying out for the Trump administration’s reform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A shockingly high number of those who contract this hospital-based germ — between 30% and 60% — die.  To put that in perspective, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 1.1%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the CDC reported 4,514 cases of C. auris infection in patients of all ages — nine times larger than that seen in the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/us-news/measles-outbreak-hits-483-cases-in-21-states-most-in-texas/"&gt;measles outbreak &lt;/a&gt;that has drawn significant public concern.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leftists are moaning that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/01/us-news/hhs-starts-parting-with-10000-workers-as-rfk-jr-s-overhaul-plans-come-together/"&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Tuesday job cuts&lt;/a&gt;, which included 2,400 CDC staffers, will imperil our health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonsense: The agency, more fittingly called the Centers for Disaster and Confusion, has fallen far short of its core mission of stopping the spread of contagious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by fighting this dangerous new infection, Kennedy can get the agency back on track.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Here’s your to-do list, Mr. Secretary: Prioritize health over political correctness, opt for transparency over secrecy, and deploy new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, put a stop to woke distractions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, while C. auris cases soared by 500%, the CDC was busy scolding health-care workers about gender-specific terms like “mother” and “father” and stigmatizing words like “smoker” and “prisoner.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous. Cutting the CDC’s language police won’t harm our health a bit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, provide transparency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not just price transparency, Republicans’ favorite cure-all, but &lt;em&gt;information &lt;/em&gt;transparency. “Bad care is a bad deal at any price,” says Leah Binder of patient-safety watchdog Leapfrog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once C. auris invades a hospital, it clings to furniture, ceiling tiles, curtains, mattresses and equipment like blood-pressure monitors and wheelchairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When patients are exposed to the fungus it attaches to their skin — and it’s virtually impossible to get rid of it. A small number develop life-threatening infections, but many more become carriers indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they’re later admitted to another hospital, they shed the fungus there, unknowingly spreading it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to be treated in a hospital struggling with this contagion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC hides which hospitals have it — protecting the hospital’s reputation, but not stopping the spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, when the fungus invaded a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/20/why-the-coverup-over-naming-hospitals-where-kids-are-dying-from-fungus/"&gt;Las Vegas hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated echocardiogram equipment, a newborn died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC only revealed the details a year later — in a report that referred to the outbreak site as “Hospital A.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If you’re about to give birth, you need to know whether the hospital you’re planning to use is battling C. auris.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That “Hospital A” jargon is no exception. The CDC &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; identifies hospitals or nursing facilities battling any type of infection. That’s unfair to the public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the CDC must join us in the 21st century. The agency’s infection-control guidance for hospitals is straight out of the 1950s.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It recommends using “EPA-approved detergents” — known to be ineffective against C. auris — and discusses changing water in buckets and laundering mop heads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No mention of new technologies that can continuously and nontoxically decontaminate rooms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed medical journals, the gold standard, have demonstrated cutting-edge methods of ridding hospital rooms of C. auris. For example, dry hydrogen peroxide emitted through the HVAC system reduced fungal contamination in a Florida hospital’s burn unit by 93%&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Las Vegas hospital used the method to reduce C. auris contamination on surfaces from 70% to just 17%, reducing the risk that patients will pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Far-UV light can also destroy hospital infection germs without posing any risk to human skin and eyes, according to data published just last month&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC is suspicious of solutions coming from the for-profit world, and the agency’s website and hospital guidelines reflect little awareness of what is technically possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one has suffered more from the agency’s backward thinking than our schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;During the COVID pandemic, numerous technologies could have been employed to get schools up and running relatively virus-free.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the CDC gave school administrators wacky, pointless advice to open the windows and keep desks six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The public deserves a CDC that can provide up-to-date scientific guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. Secretary, this is your roadmap. The CDC maintains hundreds of projects that have nothing to do with stopping infectious disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slash them and fortify the CDC to battle deadly contagions. Our lives could depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On March 21,&lt;/strong&gt; a remarkable photograph of an orca named Quiver blew up on the Facebook page of Washington State’s Orca Network Community Group, a grass-roots organization that helps monitor Puget Sound’s orca population. The moment was captured by a Whidbey Island-based photographer named Cindi Rausch. Having some years ago moved to the island from Texas, Rausch, a retired high school literature teacher, had never seen a whale of any sort until one day in 2021, when heading back to her car after a morning beach walk, she passed a group of bystanders, all armed with binoculars and long-lensed cameras.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Hey, where’ya going?” they inquired. “Whales are on the way!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Orcas, to be exact. But not just any old orcas, as Rausch would soon discover, when taking her place among the excited crowd, she immediately became captivated by the compelling story playing out in front of her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“I was told the orca family group approaching was designated T46,” Rausch recalls. “Which was primarily comprised of offspring of a very famous &lt;a href="https://www.theinertia.com/environment/kiler-whale-puget-sound-great-grand-calf-sea-world-orca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;female orca named ‘Wake.’&lt;/a&gt; In 1976, Wake and five other young orcas were captured and held in a netted pen in South Puget Sound for sale to various marine parks. This violent ‘orca roundup’ was witnessed by Washington governor’s aide &lt;a href="https://www.theinertia.com/environment/kiler-whale-puget-sound-great-grand-calf-sea-world-orca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ralph Munro&lt;/a&gt;, and the public outcry following his publicized first-hand account led not only to the release of Wake and the rest of the “Budd Inlet Six,” but a total ban on all orca capture in Washington state waters.”&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Quite understandably, Wake judiciously avoided all human contact until 13 years later, when she reemerged to public view accompanied by two daughters. Since that time, and until her death in 2023 at an estimated age of 57, Wake, as her family’s matriarch, is recognized by both researchers and orca-lovers alike as one of her species most prolific mothers. Having helped successfully rear a total of 27 offspring, she’s revered for the significant role she played in the current healthy state of today’s orca population.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This was Wake’s extended family Rausch was introduced to that day, and from that day on, she became a dedicated orca-watcher, fired by a combination of intellectual curiosity and awe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;“These are apex predators, powerful, fierce creatures with teeth that tear prey apart,” says Rausch. “There’s nothing in the water they fear. Yet at the same time, they’re sleek, graceful, incredibly social animals, and intensely loyal to their families. It’s this dichotomy that really got me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;That, and getting to know each member of this family individually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“After years of observation, you get to know every member of the T46 family by name,” Rausch explains. “Recognizing each not only by their distinctive dorsal fins and markings, but by their different personalities.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;On this particular afternoon, after receiving notification that the family group was sighted off Whidbey’s Keystone Inlet, Rausch, who out of sheer necessity had become an accomplished wildlife photographer, grabbed her big lens and rushed to the water’s edge. There she was just in time to document not only T46 members Thor, Loki, Strider, Quiver and Centeki successfully hunting down and killing an unlucky male Stellar sea lion, but the added presence of a lone outrigger canoe paddler (&lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;which just happened to be me in my OC1&lt;/span&gt;), fortunate enough to find himself in the right place at the right time to witness the ensuing drama and its celebratory aftermath.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This particular photo really resonates because of the perspective,” says Rausch. “We usually only see the whale’s dorsal fin and back. It’s rare to see the full body, the whole whale. But with the juxtaposing of the paddler in the frame, you’re struck by the whale’s enormity. And this is just Quiver, one of the family’s younger, smaller orcas. Yet what also makes the photo interesting is how the paddler is looking at Quiver in such a relaxed manner, and Quiver is obviously looking back. It’s just one of those images that I never could’ve anticipated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This, and many other photos of the T46 family group, can be found at &lt;a href="https://cindirausch.smugmug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cindirausch.smugmug.org&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These cells produce IGF-1, a protein critical for forming the myelin sheath that helps nerve signals travel efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both mice and preterm infants exposed to maternal inflammation, researchers found decreased levels of IGF-1 and delayed myelination on MRI scans. The findings suggest a potential therapeutic target to protect infant brain development and reduce the long-term effects of prenatal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Cells Affected:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal inflammation reduces CD11c-positive microglia during development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myelination Delays:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower IGF-1 levels linked to disrupted myelin formation in infants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting microglia may prevent long-term neurodevelopmental delays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research group led by Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan has uncovered a potential mechanism linking maternal inflammation to delayed neurodevelopment in infants. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests the role of CD11c-positive microglia—immune cells in the brain crucial for myelination—during infant brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108344"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby's face and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;, suggest new strategies to mitigate the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of maternal inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation during pregnancy occurs when the mother’s immune system becomes activated during pregnancy, typically due to an infection, autoimmune response, or environmental factors. It can have negative outcomes for the baby, potentially causing long-term cognitive and behavioral challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team led by Kazuya Fuma and Tomomi Kotani has discovered the role of CD11c-positive microglia in this process. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, play a key role in myelination, the process where nerve fibers are coated with myelin. Myelin is essential for making the nerve cells able to transmit electrical signals efficiently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers tested mice that were exposed to maternal inflammation. They found that the proliferation of these cells was reduced. Then, to determine if these findings were relevant to humans, the researchers analyzed cord blood from preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis, a condition that causes inflammation during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found lower levels of IGF-1, a protein linked to CD11c-positive microglia, in their samples. When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation during pregnancy suppressed the increase in CD11c microglia that we usually see during typical infant development,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CD11c microglia have been reported to be involved in myelination by being a major source of IGF-1. In the present study, both were decreased in inflammation during pregnancy, suggesting that this pathway is impaired in children with delayed neurodevelopment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sheds light on the complex relationship between maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment. The researchers hope that understanding the role of CD11c-positive microglia in neurodevelopment will lead to new therapeutic strategies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If future studies confirm a decrease in these microglia in preterm infants exposed to inflammatory conditions, such as chorioamnionitis, early interventions could be developed to prevent or reduce the neurodevelopmental impact of maternal inflammation,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting CD11c-positive microglia, it may be possible to protect infants from the long-term consequences of impaired myelination and improve their chances for healthy cognitive development.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb8288848686b4998e988e8a998883ab9fc5868a8287c5858a8c84928ac69ec58a88c5819b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthew Coslett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nagoya-u.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matthew Coslett – Nagoya University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07511-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Kazuya Fuma et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) is a form of maternal immune activation (MIA) linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our previous study identified neurodevelopmental impairments in an MIA mouse model mimicking HCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, this study investigated the role of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia, key contributors to myelination through IGF-1 production, in this pathology. In the mouse model, the CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population was significantly lower in the MIA group than in the control group on postnatal day 3 (PN3d).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, myelination-related protein levels significantly decreased in the MIA group at PN8d. In humans, preterm infants with HCA exhibited higher IL-6 and IL-17A cord-serum levels and lower IGF-1 levels than those without HCA, followed by a higher incidence of delayed myelination on magnetic resonance imaging at the term-equivalent age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In silico analysis revealed that the transient induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during early development occurred similarly in mice and humans. Notably, a lack of high CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population has been observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reports impaired induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during postnatal development in a mouse model of MIA associated with delayed myelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings may inform strategies for improving outcomes in infants with HCA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:58:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPM1ZGYWJtM205ZjhGQVJCSTI2alpSbW9lSWVNbl9icGkxS2ZfUy1jajF2WjhQQ0dBQlU0a0RkX3cxNzNUVmJsbXpwVi0yclk4R2lDcU41czlEZHVoeWdlYjl1M0tCQnRGT2tyd095VmZyNVFCR3BvNXhrNUlDMlVCc1hvRHVobnRJ</guid></item><item><title>Dozens of free measles vaccine clinics close in Texas as federal funding is cut - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQZ3ZLNFcxdkExVDRBa25VaWhVUWNWand5dXkzTjhXY2FyeVdEMkpnTFBubzgyX1NfQWdxRWpsSHJCOUx4WThHTDMwQ3ZtT3dMTFM3QlhOS0VRalhnc0FETVlTbWJYY2lkeDE0SkFFd0FqNkZCT3diSHRNam9DazdwUEJMemVyOEY5RGEzVHp3Z0Vyb0M0RFdyb3RHQTZFSXB6R0k0dllZNGVPbUdLZlHSAVZBVV95cUxOVmVVZTE1R1pJeUE3Q2dScjRJZkplN0xCQWl3aU9iNHlDaUc2SUkyaVUtdlYzWHNxYWp2d3I4U3RsT0NyMzVhRmtEei0xSDFsb0kwZ2ltdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;Steep federal funding cuts &lt;/a&gt;have forced public health officials in one of Texas’ most populous counties — Dallas — to cancel dozens of vaccination clinics and lay off 21 workers on the front lines of combatting the state’s growing measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we’ve had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Many of the clinics had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The vaccines, which included measles, mumps and rubella shots, were meant to be given free to families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The money being cut — $11.4 billion nationwide — was originally allocated to aid community health departments during the pandemic. Local public health officials have more recently been using the Covid funds for other public health initiatives, such as measles prevention, surveillance and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last week however, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars&lt;/a&gt; responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s very short-sighted and not understanding of the way public health works,” Huang said. “Being prepared for Covid helps build our capacity to be able to respond to other issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Huang said his team was still assessing the exact amount of money slashed in his budget, but estimated it to be in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of Tuesday, 422 measles had been reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. None are in Dallas County, but Huang said the cuts would leave his community vulnerable to cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eleven full-time and 10 part-time staffers were let go, he said.

MDGA2 typically keeps BDNF/TrkB signaling in check, but when MDGA2 levels drop, heightened neuronal activity and social impairments occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with reduced MDGA2 showed behaviors resembling autism, including repetitive grooming and social withdrawal. Treatment with a peptide that mimics MDGA2 restored balance and eased symptoms, suggesting a potential pathway for future autism therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Low MDGA2 disrupts BDNF/TrkB signaling, triggering ASD-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Affected mice showed repetitive behaviors and social deficits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Mimicking MDGA2 reduced symptoms, pointing to new treatment avenues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In mice, autism symptoms arise when a certain pair of competing nerve proteins falls out of equilibrium, according to a study published April 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; by Dongdong Zhao of Wenzhou Medical University, China, Yun-wu Zhang of Xiamen University, China, and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1% of the world population is considered to have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), exhibiting a series of social and cognitive symptoms.

Experimental trials revealed that mice with reduced levels of MDGA2 exhibited ASD-like symptoms, including repetitive grooming and altered social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice also exhibited increased activity in certain nerve synapses and increased levels of BDNF, another neuronal protein that has been linked to ASD and functions through binding and activating the TrkB protein. When these mice were treated with an artificial peptide that mimicked MDGA2 and inhibited BDNF/TrkB activity, the symptoms lessened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results combined with previous research, the authors suggest that MDGA2 and BDNF maintain a natural balance by competing with each other for TrkB protein binding sites, and disruption to this system can lead to regulatory changes in neuron activity related to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protein system might be a promising target for future therapeutic treatments, but further investigation will be required into the exact functions of this system and its relationship to ASD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yun-wu Zhang adds, “Mutations in the &lt;em&gt;MDGA2 &lt;/em&gt;gene causes autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but the underlying mechanism is elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study reveals a novel role of MDGA2 in keeping the BDNF/TrkB signaling at bay for normal excitatory neuronal activity, and demonstrates that MDGA2 deficiency results in aberrant BDNF/TrkB activation and elevated excitatory neuronal activity, leading to ASD-like phenotypes in mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82001442 to D.Z., and 82130039 and U21A20361 to Y.-w.Z.), and Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2020M671948 to D.Z., and 2022M722651 to Y.H.).

Both loss of MDGA2 and the ASD-associated MDGA2 V930I mutation promote the BDNF/TrkB signaling activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB signaling by both small molecular compound and MDGA2-derived peptide can attenuate the increase of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity and social deficits in MDGA2-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight a novel MDGA2-BDNF/TrkB-dependent mechanism underlying the synaptic function regulation, which may become a therapeutic target for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:24:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9oaUEtQkFoSTlaUEIyT1dLZUdtV2doYlFkSkFHdkZYYjRZN1paVGpSZDBEMFQtMFoySjdkS1BNT0xpdzAtYzY4NG50YlFEZ1VKRWFfVzdBMVh2QXN2S0RzeWNsanlKV2s</guid></item><item><title>Hidden Heart Risks: Antidepressants Linked to Sudden Cardiac Death - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:11:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c</guid></item><item><title>New study says Lexington has among the highest STI rates in the country - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOHZ5c1V6Yi1rLUdYZFI0dkg1dU5UaGprTzAtSTVIdi1VeHd3cWNOQU8zTEtCRUxEcG5PNnBIc1VEVVZJeG9SQlhPTGlHd2tuRUlrVlRXZFB5RndKOEh6S2gzaWtQekZvaEtJMnpDS2VqNU1iQ19FeElQMTh6aE9ncXBzMnVxSkQtVXdCUmNjbjNLS1BBVGRHcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LEXINGTON, Ky.

Because it might lead to being able to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McDonough explained that Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, and that it's characterized by a buildup of harmful toxins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we could clear waste in the brain, pathology would never have a chance to clump and damage neurons and therefore, cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease would not occur (and no Alzheimer's diagnosis would occur either),' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But McDonough explained that all of this research is pretty new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as of right now, we don't have good ways to clear brain waste in humans through a procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that this doesn't mean that there's no other possible way to slow the potential diagnosis of Alzheimer's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Several lifestyle factors may help the brain naturally clear our waste like increasing the quality of one's sleep,' McDonough said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By clearing up this 'brain waste,' researchers have the potential to prevent the effects of dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During sleep, the glymphatic system becomes especially active, flushing out the unwanted materials to keep your brain clean and healthy, much like a nightly cleanup that prevents buildup and potential damage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he explained that research done on aging mice has shown that regular aerobic exercise can boost the function of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McDounough said that this is the brain's cleaning network, and it's boosted by enhancing blood flow and arterial pulsation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research is showing that dementia can also be prevented with more education, correcting hearing loss, reducing cholesterol, reducing depression, increasing physical activity, reducing the likelihood of getting diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other things like eliminating smoking, obesity, lowering alcohol intake, increasing social activity, and reducing exposure to air pollution can also all aid at preventing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/26/over-70-of-americans-are-more-health-conscious/"&gt;As Americans become increasingly health-conscious&lt;/a&gt;, their online grocery orders are showing a shift toward more nutritious food choices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s according to Instacart, which recently revealed new dietary trends based on customers’ purchase and search data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using data from 2023 to 2024, the online grocery delivery platform calculated a 39% uptick in searches for “high protein,” as well as a 159% surge in searches for “high fiber.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instacart also said it’s seen a 9% increase in purchases of lower-sugar foods and beverages and an 8% spike in low-carb purchases since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other key findings as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly Springer, a registered dietitian in Skaneateles, New York, said she’s encouraged by the trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you are doing Instacart, you’re more likely to purchase those healthier food items than to be buying spur-of-the-moment-kind-of-foods in the food aisle,” she told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For its methodology, Instacart calculated the percentage difference in the share of orders that each category appeared in from 2023 to 2024. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the non-alcoholic cocktails category had a 350% increase in its share of orders in 2024 compared to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These trends are a reflection of how consumers are embracing more holistic and personalized approaches to health,” Alex Orellana, Instacart’s trends analyst, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“High-protein products remain popular not just for muscle building but also for boosting metabolism and energy, while fiber-rich foods are gaining momentum with increased awareness of the gut-brain connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orellana said low-carb diets also remain popular as they support stable energy levels and align with broader weight management and wellness goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instacart has unearthed some additional predictions for the future of healthy eating this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/instacarts-flavorful-food-forecast-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flavorful food forecast&lt;/a&gt; for 2025, the company revealed major growth in prebiotic and probiotic beverages, with its order data showing 58% year-over-year growth in these two categories between 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that people are starting to listen about the correlation of digestive health to health in general,” Springer said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also a growing interest in tinned fish, a once-popular mealtime staple that had fallen out of favor in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to year-over-year growth in the share of orders containing canned mackerel and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/health/retiree-claims-she-lost-35-pounds-eating-sardines/"&gt;canned sardines&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 to 2024, these two tinned fishes displayed a 74% and 13% growth, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Springer said it’s “awesome” that omega-3s – essential fatty acids that help to reduce inflammation – “are really making headway.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People also can’t seem to get enough of enhanced water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Purchases of electrolyte drink powders between 2023 and 2024 showed a 36% increase, with the share of purchases of coconut water growing by 7% during the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All this data suggests that a health and wellness focus continues to influence Americans as they make their grocery shopping decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a dietitian, I couldn’t be prouder of Americans,” Springer said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;After last weekend’s showers and a week of heat forecast, conditions are ideal for mosquito reproduction, which has officials concerned over the spread of mosquito-borne disease. Last year, mosquito control across the state saw record numbers in travel-related cases of the mosquito-borne disease dengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s expecting another season of above-average numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be surprising if we aren't at the same level that we were last year,” said Steve Harrison, manager of Orange County Mosquito Control. “You could assume that going into the subsequent year that you're going to see a little more activity, because rarely does it drop off to extreme levels from year to year. It's normally a gradual decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue, also known as “bone break fever,” causes a variety of symptoms including fever, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and eye pain. In more severe cases, it can cause abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and bleeding from the gums or nose, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the state reported 911 travel-related cases, according to data from the Florida Department of Health. There were also 85 local cases reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How dengue goes from one country to another&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel-related cases are concerning because of how the dengue virus moves from person to person. Florida travelers may go to a dengue-endemic country, like Cuba, and return with the virus. If a Florida mosquito bites that traveler, that mosquito can then infect a Florida resident. If it happens enough times, the virus could become endemic in Florida. Increasing the virus’s odds of propagating are hotter temperatures and more rainfall, creating ideal breeding conditions for more mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrison said early projections of summer weather indicate mosquitoes should have a season to thrive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, looking at the trends, one would assume that we're probably going to see levels that we did last year, because people are still traveling as much,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, there have been no reported local cases of dengue throughout the state. However, there have been 49 travel cases as of week 12 of the year. Seven cases have been reported in Central Florida, including four from Orange County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that same 12-week time period last year, there were 77 cases. This year’s number, although lower, is still concerning considering it’s higher than the 6-year average (2020–2025) of 35 cases, and much higher than the 10-year average (2010-2019) of nine cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, dengue cases have been increasing globally for the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors are associated with the spread of dengue, including “climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall,” according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, FDOH listed 10 different Caribbean destinations where Florida travelers have picked up dengue. The top three were Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stop dengue from spreading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Mosquito Control teams are calling on residents to help lessen the chance of spreading dengue by tossing out basins of still water on their property, eliminating possible mosquito breeding grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Routinely go out to your yard. Make sure you're flushing out your bird baths. You're flushing out your potted plants, anything that can hold water. Toss out those containers,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is experiencing a large amount of mosquito activity at their home, they can reach out to mosquito control by calling the county line 311 or 407-836-3111.&lt;/p&gt;

Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right. While it’s certainly true that some cheeses are packed with saturated fats and sodium (and not much else), others boast enough vitamins, protein, and good bacteria to receive a gold star from any dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set out to determine the healthiest cheeses you can eat, consulting two nutritionists and a food scientist in our quest to determine which should earn a spot in this prestigious (to us, at least!) lineup. There were a lot of factors to consider. "Look at the nutrient density per calorie," &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rosemary Trout;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rosemary Trout&lt;/a&gt;, program director of culinary arts and food science at Drexel University, says. Opt for cheeses that are "low in saturated fat and sodium" and "high in protein, calcium, and probiotics," Jennifer Altman, PsyD, R.D., advises. With all that in mind, here are the five cheeses that took top honors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mozzarella&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PHOTO: LINDA PUGLIESE; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozzarella is a shoo-in in this healthy cheese bracket, boasting &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170845/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:six grams of protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;six grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; in just a one-ounce serving. In addition to being high in protein, it’s also "lower in saturated fat and sodium" and "a good source of calcium, phosphorus, and zinc, all essential nutrients for good bone health," Altman shares. Mozzarella also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29542032/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; bacterias Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum, two valuable probiotics that promote good gut health.

This is due to goat milk’s "higher concentration of short-chain fatty acids compared to bovine milk," she explains. Kim Yawitz, R.D. and owner of &lt;a href="https://crossfit26.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Two Six Fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Two Six Fitness&lt;/a&gt; in St. Louis, MO, agrees, explaining that these smaller fat molecules are also “digested more quickly...which can help you feel fuller faster" and lead to "eating fewer calories at later meals." A cheese that comes with built-in portion control assistance? Yes, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;BHOFACK2 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;High in protein and loaded with valuable Vitamins B and B12, this creamy cheese has been a well-known health food for years. According to Yawitz, "one cup...contains 24 grams of muscle-building, belly-filling protein," making it a great option for people looking to double down on this important macronutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Yawitz shares that many cottage cheese brands "contain bacteria that can help bolster your immune system and improve digestion." Maybe it’s time to give that viral &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a61238259/cottage-cheese-bark-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cottage cheese bark;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cottage cheese bark&lt;/a&gt; a shot!

It’s also high in calcium, with &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170848/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:335 mg per ounce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;335 mg per ounce&lt;/a&gt; serving. On the flip side, parmesan is fairly high in sodium, so it’s not advised to eat in large amounts—especially if salt is a concern for you—but fortunately, it brings such a punch of flavor that most of us aren’t chomping through a whole block of it in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swiss Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;gaffera - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This famous holey cheese was &lt;a href="https://torontosun.com/2017/08/18/research-says-swiss-cheese-is-a-superfood" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shortlisted as a superfood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;shortlisted as a superfood&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 for containing a healthy probiotic bacterium called Propionibacterium freudenreichii. According to Yawitz, studies have suggested that this probiotic can "help decrease inflammation, fight off infection, and even slow the aging process." Beyond the benefits of this probiotic, Yawitz shares that Swiss cheese is also high in other key nutrients, including "Vitamin B12, calcium, and phosphorus." It’s also "a good source of protein and calcium, which are good for bone health," Altman says. When was the last time you had a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23872214/classic-reuben-sandwich-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reuben;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Reuben&lt;/a&gt;? Might want to get back on that train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But which cheese is the absolute healthiest? Well...it depends on your specific nutritional needs and health goals. If you’re looking for more protein in your diet, raid your local grocery store for cottage cheese and parmesan. If you’re concerned with the amount of sodium in your diet, grab a ball of mozzarella. And if you want to feel stronger, healthier, and possibly even live longer, reach for that block of Swiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:05:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxObDVLU0I2bkxMRE9MRHpmQUxTZHJyUHJnRDNlT2tKWjlpTkl4TEo3bUZ2VVAtam5UV2VTRjVBaURTSEppUXAtdlZjTkhpcEJpU1NEV21iLUJydUVBWEVmdmNiTUp6THpGQU9uN1hNUkdpN1loZlVKZDh3ZDJlOTV5Rw</guid></item><item><title>Fasting every other day outperforms calorie cutting, clinical trial indicates - upi.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNc254Z3oxcTVsYUYtS0NRWUh0N0NUc1pieDJRQ3hoSENlS2xVNDY1M2VicVFXLWpEM2dpSHF5SlpMRHNUTUtxTVRCSk0tUS0tdU5lQkdGSDl5VFBuOTRmQzQxT0xaQWk4MGdwN3VnUkhuQW9RTjRaQkI5WDdKM1VFeUZ0cjBtTWttTWhxdDJPWXhVN0djU2hHT1JKUm83QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-12 col-lg-7"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting every other day can prompt more weight loss than simply cutting calories, a new clinical trial shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who undertook 4:3 intermittent fasting lost just under 8% of their body weight within a year, compared to a 5% loss among people who cut their daily calories by about a third, researchers reported Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 4:3 intermittent fasting, people restrict their calorie intake by 80% three days a week, alternating between days with no dietary restrictions at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Long-term adherence to daily calorie restriction is challenging for many people," wrote the research team co-led by &lt;a href="https://cehhs.utk.edu/krss/4815-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Danielle Ostendorf&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of kinesiology, recreation and sport studies at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that 4:3 [intermittent] is an alternative dietary &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/nutrition/why-cant-i-lose-weight-2659046552.html" target="_blank"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; strategy that may produce modestly superior weight loss compared with [daily calorie restriction] at 12 months, when provided in the context of a high-intensity, comprehensive behavioral weight loss program," the team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this trial, researchers assigned 84 overweight and obese people to this type of fasting, and another 81 folks to cut their calories by 34%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups were asked to get in 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week, double the amount recommended by U.S. physical activity guidelines. They also received support from a weight-loss program led by a registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year, the research team compared how the two groups did, and found that those who fasted lost slightly more weight on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, those who fasted had better odds of achieving the sort of weight loss that produces health benefits, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 38% of fasting participants lost at least 10% of their body weight by the end of the year, compared 16% of those who cut calories, the study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More people were able to stick with fasting. Nearly 30% of those assigned to calorie cutting dropped out of the study, compared with 19% of those in the fasting group, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks who fasted also tended to take in fewer calories overall, and had more improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alternative patterns of restricting dietary energy intake for weight loss are gaining attention due to the difficulty of adhering to a reduced-calorie diet on a daily basis," researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An appealing feature of [intermittent fasting] is that dieters do not have to focus on counting calories and restricting intake every day as they do with daily calorie restriction," they continued. "Furthermore, the periodic nature of fasting may mitigate the constant hunger associated with [daily calorie restriction]."

town at the center of a measles outbreak have been hospitalized after taking an unproven treatment touted by Robert F Kennedy Junior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have reported a handful of unvaccinated children in West Texas were treated for liver damage in the past two months thought to be linked to vitamin A poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-14454399/RFK-Jr-urges-vaccination-measles-Texas-outbreak.html"&gt;long-time vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, has strongly endorsed vitamin A as a treatment for measles despite the evidence being mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have shown that supplementation can reduce the risk of compilations and death in malnourished children with severely low levels of vitamin A, which is found in several foods including eggs, dairy, and cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other research has shown little benefit in children with adequate vitamin A levels, which is the case for most youngsters in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of overdosing comes from the fact high levels of vitamin A put significant stress on liver cells, potentially causing inflammation, cell death, and scarring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;400 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been identified in West Texas communities, where vaccination rates range from 30 to 60 percent, since January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-one patients have been hospitalized and at least one has died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has endorsed high doses of vitamin A supplements as a safe and effective treatment for measles despite years of scientific research failing to prove this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr recently directed the CDC to&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;

Further studies are necessary to define the optimal fasting schedule and delineate the health benefits. Unfortunately, no one method will work for all people.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Comparing different intermittent fasting regimens, and perhaps breaking down further by other variables such as age, gender, or ethnicity, may help define an optimal diet for a particular group of patients,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of the study were not completely surprising as this type of intermittent fasting may act similarly to ‘metabolic confusion’ or ‘calorie shifting’ which essentially can catch the body by surprise and ‘shake things up’ by oscillating between a calorie deficit and sufficiency in addition to burning calories with exercise between intervals of rest and action,” Richard, who was likewise not involved in the study, explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been research studies that have observed the positive benefits of these patterns, as in this study, but it is limited and overall success is highly variable and based on multiple factors unique to the individual and the study design methodology,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 4:3 intermittent fasting schedule calls for three days of fasting and four days of normal eating each week, that might be hard for some people to commit to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can a person figure out the best intermittent fasting schedule for them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying out intermittent fasting — and more specifically the 4:3 pattern — Richard advised readers to take into consideration several factors that could influence their success and sustainability, such as: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prescription medications (&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323760" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, high blood pressure medication, etc.) that could be impacted by drastically altering nutrient and energy intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mood/emotional and psychological well-being — are you the type of person who gets “hangry” or develops a headache after not eating for 6 to 8 hours?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;social wellbeing — will this pattern impede my ability to join friends and family for dinner parties, celebrations, or brunch? This can lead to isolation, resentment, disordered eating patterns, thoughts or possible &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173184" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;binge-eating&lt;/a&gt; or related behavior. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Richard said to take it one step at a time with these simple tips: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;have a support group or small group to try intermittent fasting together&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;start slow — observe if fasting for 24 hours is doable, followed by 24 hours of eating 80% of recommended calories for a day, alternate for a week, then build up to 48 hours fasting, and so on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;keep in mind that nonfasting days are not “a-cheat-day-free-for-all” or “get out of healthy eating pass.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also practice the 4:3 method by fasting or restricting calorie intake to 20% of your &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263028" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;daily calorie needs&lt;/a&gt; for 24 hours on three nonconsecutive days per week, as was done in the study. Breaking up fasting days may make this regimen easier to stick to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have long observed that in most instances, a slow, steady, informed, and intentional approach is often most advantageous,” Richard said. “Dietary patterns and activity along with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mindfulness-for-mental-wellbeing" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, neuroplasticity activities, and spiritual and social wellbeing for a well-balanced [life] seem to follow that logic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meeting with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) will allow clear information related to nutrient needs and the safety, applicability, and best practices in how implementing a pattern such as this can apply to an individual,” she added. “There are also unique genetic pathways and factors that may inhibit or support the success and desired outcomes using intermittent fasting, which an RDN can help an individual navigate and understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:41:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNQVAwM3NweF93SmZUU2YzMkp3bzkzX0ZKdTFXMGplTnA3NnhiTUNGZVh5WjRFbGdOUHQyUGxBajVuVVhmaFJKNEhXU3V6WGQ0bEJVNS1TbW5iLTd1Z1JfREpOVGRFaEV0UzVLU0RvbjNrX25jYW9oZWdHQ3VtRmFub2Fpand2UDVPQzZSVEduT1JuNGtnTEhhV3JwVjVQUUNJWHZFbUt2VnZEczBZVXNN</guid></item><item><title>Pet owners urged to avoid bait packets: USDA airdropping rabies vaccine - WATE 6 On Your Side</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

That does not mean a parent’s job as support staff is done. Parents continue to be an important source of practical, or “instrumental,” support (driving teens where they need to go) as well as emotional support (offering a sympathetic ear at the end of a bad day). “Adolescents very much need those different dimensions of support from their parents,” McCabe said. The catch, she added, is that many adolescents would never admit it. “They might argue and debate with everything their parent says but still very much rely on them to empathize with what they’re going through,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, while peer support is important, it does not replace the role of caring adults, said Lisa Damour, PhD, a clinical psychologist specializing in teens and senior adviser to the Schubert Center for Child Studies at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. “The single most powerful force for adolescent mental health is strong relationships with caring adults. A relationship with a great adult is like the fluoride in the water of adolescent mental health care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As children mature, though, what they need from parents begins to look different. Parents, for instance, often go into problem-solving mode if their teen is struggling. But the child may be seeking validation. That disconnect might explain why most parents think their teens are getting plenty of support, while their children say otherwise. Experts recommend a less-is-more approach to conversations. For instance, instead of urging your child to email their teacher if they think they received an unfair grade—or calling the teacher yourself to complain—it might be more effective to say, “That sounds really frustrating. How do you think you’ll handle it?” “As parents our instinct is often to jump in with advice, but it’s very rare that that’s what teens are looking for—and that’s not necessarily what’s going to invite them to keep bringing their concerns our way,” Damour said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When adults envision connecting with a teenager, they often picture a conversation where the teenager bares their soul and the adult says helpful things, and then everybody hugs,” Damour added. But teenagers are more likely to feel connected when watching a TV show with their parent or sharing an interest in what is playing on the car radio. “Teenagers often feel supported not through a conversation but through our steady presence. It’s about being around and available,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers, coaches, and other nonfamily mentors also play an important role in supporting youth. Adolescents who have supportive non-parental adults in their lives have been found to have higher levels of academic functioning, better self-esteem, fewer behavioral problems, and lower rates of mental health problems and substance use, as described in a review by Emma Sterrett-Hong, PhD, now an associate professor at the University of Louisville (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10464-011-9429-y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Community Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. 48, No. 3–4, 2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists are among those working to boost connections between teens and adult mentors. One such intervention is Relationship Mapping, a new tool developed by Richard Weissbourd, PhD, a psychologist who directs the Making Caring Common Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Relationship Mapping charts the relationships between students and staff, helping to identify which students do not have positive connections with any adults in the school community—a critical first step to reach youth most at risk of falling through the cracks. After a small pilot last school year, Weissbourd and his colleagues are now implementing the tool in a larger sample of U.S. schools and collecting data about its outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such programs can do a lot to help kids get the support they need. But in addition to new ideas and interventions, communities should not forget the importance of old-fashioned investments in schools, teacher training programs, and extracurricular activities, Damour said. “We need to be very cautious about cutting arts programming or after-school programming,” she added. “So many teenagers are saved by their drama teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, parents and practitioners can continue to help kids develop the social-emotional skills they need to nurture supportive relationships. One way adults can help, Damour said, is by being clear with young people about the kinds of concerns that are too big for kids to tackle on their own, including worries about eating disorders, self-harm, or other serious behaviors. “Kids turn to one another often for support, and they are incredibly good at caring for one another. But sometimes they are so attentive that they try to help friends with challenges that really need to be addressed by adults with professional training,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents and practitioners alike can also help children practice a skill that is hard at any age: asking for support. “Most adolescents struggle with being assertive and asking for what they need. We can help them articulate what they feel they’re missing, and practice how to ask for it: Is it feeling understood or validated? A sense of belonging at school? Guidance or advice?” McCabe said. “Social support isn’t one-size-fits-all.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

If your core is weak, your back and other muscles have to do extra work, which can lead to pain or injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not just athletes who need a strong core. Everyday activities like bending down to tie your shoes or picking up groceries become way easier when your core is in check.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the coach, people in their 20s should be able to do 40 to 50 crunches  as your core is 'at its prime'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/how-many-crunches-you-should-be-able-to-do-at-every-age/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;: 'Think of it as a warmup for all the adventures your abs will support, like dancing all night or carrying groceries in one trip.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then states that those in their in their 30s should manage&lt;span&gt; to do 30 to 40 crunches - noting that 'this is the decade to focus on maintaining strength while juggling work, family and Netflix binges'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long-time trainer added that those in their 40s should be able to 20 to 30 crunches as 'your metabolism might slow'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David also stated that 'consistency is key' and it is important to make sure you are getting some form of exercise in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Yorker further recommend that people in their 50s should be able to push through 15 to 25 crunches to 'stay active and strong'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, people who are aged 60 and above should be able to do 10 to 20 crunches comfortably. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While David admits that the total number of crunches you are able to do varies from person to person, he also warns that being unable to perform the minimum for your age group could be a red flag for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'In some cases, difficulty performing crunches could point to underlying issues like back problems, joint pain or even cardiovascular fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It also likely means that your body is craving more and it is your job to give it what it needs and deserves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding it difficult to perform exercises while accompanied with chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations, may indicate a potential heart health problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the long run, less active people reportedly have a 30 to 50 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Strengthening the core muscles through crunches can also help stabilize the spine and reduce the risk of lower back pain and injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical inactivity is also one of the key reasons along with cigarette smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol that can pave the way for cardiovascular diseases, the New York Department of Health states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, only about one in five adults and teens get enough exercise to maintain good health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency recommends adults to engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for about 150 minutes per week, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOcW5HRTlRbDFSamZtWElXbWtBMFBsX1ZkcXlWUzRUall0MU9rYzJ3cnR2YThIT2daSzhIUk82UTFEblBFNW5KTTA2TG9yeExxWElFRUxHRklvVl9xUjRqZDNYV0dEckh0ZVlaOXY2dFBwOHZSME15VV9Gb3lEU01mU1Eya2NsMTYtcFc5Y3VnTEN2RGZhaXlsa1Z6VUNSOWsz0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5WZkREa0hBTVVLS05KdjI2YTBuRnY3TjVIX1g1MzhNaXp0THVSZW9rbG9UUExIckdRaVpOaS1lemh0MEJCNWttVG1QYU53U3hDR3pra3l3NHlxSkVNTUhHU1AxVVN0UU1Ra0VWMkoyRTdockVFVHFoZDYwd3k3Wjk5NURZNkNzT0tWYmlDbm5UWVp2elZNeWRObTl6WHlQTHVOMUFlbUE</guid></item><item><title>We can, must, and will simulate nematode brains - Hacker News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5FUTZFbEhvX0ZScVdobDZtaVNySVF2NGZQYzFZOHloMzhQNFN2QWZ6cTFjSzJTRjVXLTJfcl8za1FjTUVGMTdkUVNXbUFYSnU5TXl5cGVQTG0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:56:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5FUTZFbEhvX0ZScVdobDZtaVNySVF2NGZQYzFZOHloMzhQNFN2QWZ6cTFjSzJTRjVXLTJfcl8za1FjTUVGMTdkUVNXbUFYSnU5TXl5cGVQTG0</guid></item><item><title>Omega-6 fatty acid promotes the growth of an aggressive type of breast cancer, study finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxQa2tSLWJsNHlpRDhiYXVfQ2VyVlNiWjR3aXQ1WnBqc1QxU2Nla19fSTkzQUpXaU1VbnJlZERoU19uYVZKeW9zV0VjYVVXNTYzV2huUGFROG1fYmFiWDBjZ0dNd2gxako4bEtlM0N2dEQybWJVQjNDZVZFYnVTNDJxRzJETnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid found in seed oils such as soybean and safflower oil, and animal products including pork and eggs, specifically enhances the growth of the hard-to-treat "triple negative" breast cancer subtype, according to a preclinical study led by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. The discovery could lead to new dietary and pharmaceutical strategies against breast and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published March 14 in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, the researchers found that linoleic acid can activate a major growth pathway in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt; by binding to a protein called FABP5. Comparing breast cancer subtypes, the team observed that this growth pathway activation occurs in triple-negative tumor cells, where FABP5 is particularly abundant, but not in other hormone-sensitive subtypes. In a mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer, a diet high in linoleic acid enhanced tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalized manner," said study senior author Dr. John Blenis, the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Professor of Cancer Research in the Department of Pharmacology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega-6 linoleic acid is a diet-derived nutrient that is considered essential in mammals for supporting multiple bodily processes. However, the abundance of this fat in "Western-style" diets has increased significantly since the 1950s, coinciding with the increased usage of seed oils in fried and ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to concerns that excessive omega-6 intake might be one of the explanations for rising rates of certain diseases, including breast cancers. But decades of studies have yielded mixed and inconclusive results, and have never uncovered any biological mechanism tying omega-6s to cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers sought to resolve this confusion by initially looking at breast cancer, which has been linked to modifiable factors such as obesity. They looked at the ability of omega-6 fatty acids—particularly linoleic acid, the dominant one in the Western diet—to drive an important, nutrient-sensing growth pathway called the mTORC1 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key initial finding was that linoleic acid does indeed activate mTORC1 in cell and animal models of breast cancers, but only in triple-negative subtypes. (The term "triple negative" refers to the absence of three receptors, including estrogen receptors, that are often expressed by breast tumor cells and can be targeted with specific treatments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists discovered that this subtype-specific effect occurs because the polyunsaturated fatty acid forms a complex with FABP5, which is produced at high levels in triple-negative breast tumors but not in other subtypes, leading to the assembly and activation of mTORC1, a major regulator of cell metabolism and cancer cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeding mice that model &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/triple-negative+breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; a high-linoleic-acid diet increased FABP5 levels, mTORC1 activation and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers also found increased levels of FABP5 and linoleic acid in the tumors and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from newly diagnosed triple-negative patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The findings show that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/linoleic+acid/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt; can have a role in breast cancer, though in a more targeted and defined context than previously appreciated. The study also is thought to be the first to establish a specific mechanism through which this common dietary ingredient influences disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illumination of FABP5's importance in this process suggests, moreover, that it could be a good "biomarker" to guide more personalized nutritional and therapeutic interventions for patients with triple negative &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, which currently lacks any targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have only begun to investigate the effects of omega-6-FABP5-mTORC1 signaling in other diseases, but in the study, they showed that the same pathway can enhance the growth of some prostate cancer subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There may be a broader role for FABP5-mTORC1 signaling in other cancer types and even in common chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes," said study first author Dr. Nikos Koundouros, a postdoctoral research associate in the Blenis laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

It's essential for sex drive, muscle growth and strength, and bone density. However, it's important for more than that, according to Madison Reeder, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://modifyhealth.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;ModifyHealth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"It plays a far more expansive role by supporting cellular signaling, protein synthesis, fat distribution, and cognitive and emotional regulation," Reeder said. The processes supported by testosterone influence everything from muscle maintenance to red blood cell production to energy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/testosterone-imbalance-signs/" target="_self"&gt;all need testosterone&lt;/a&gt; at some level to feel our best, though it's central to men's health. Low testosterone (also called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;hypogonadism&lt;/a&gt;) occurs when the testicles aren't producing enough testosterone. It's more common than you might think. It's estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;35% of men over 45&lt;/a&gt; years of age have hypogonadism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle changes like moderating alcohol and quitting smoking are necessary for maintaining testosterone levels, another important factor is what you eat. Packing your diet with certain foods may help boost your testosterone levels to a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do testosterone levels vary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone naturally fluctuates. According to Dr. Justin Houman, an assistant professor of urology at &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/home.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, testosterone levels are generally at their highest point in the morning and decline throughout the day, in line with the body's circadian rhythm. Testosterone also changes throughout life. It sharply increases during puberty and gradually decreases after age 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond that, fluctuations can be influenced by a wide range of factors: &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/get-better-sleep-for-sleep-awareness-month-with-these-6-simple-tips/" target="_self"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/carefree-era-tactics-relieve-stress/" target="_self"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt; (particularly &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/blood-stress-test-cortisol-effects-our-bodies/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;), body fat percentage, alcohol consumption, certain medications and even acute or chronic illness," said Houman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pituitary gland is central to regulating testosterone production in the body, and it's a sensitive system that can easily be thrown off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that can &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15603-low-testosterone-male-hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact testosterone levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; include but are not limited to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Urological Association, low testosterone is a &lt;a href="https://www.auanet.org/guidelines-and-quality/guidelines/testosterone-deficiency-guideline" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;level below 300 ng/dL&lt;/a&gt;. A healthy range is considered between 450 and 600ng/dL. "However, there is no "one-size-fits-all" testosterone level. The body's ideal level is influenced by age, sex, genetics, health history, and even how well you sleep or manage stress," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with low testosterone, one of the first places you can look is your diet. Unhealthy diets or chronic under-fueling can impair hormone production while working toward a balanced diet full of nutrients can help stabilize your levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9 foods that may increase testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There isn't a single 'testosterone superfood,' but certain foods support the body's natural testosterone production by providing key nutrients or reducing inflammation and oxidative stress," Houman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritional content of certain foods can give you a leg up when it comes to testosterone, especially if you're deficient in that particular nutrient. Reeder pointed to zinc, vitamin D, magnesium, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/keep-your-heart-healthy-with-omega-3s-heres-how-to-add-them-to-your-diet/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and high-quality protein as pivotal nutrients for healthy testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding the foods on this list to your diet won't magically fix low testosterone levels. However, being intentional about making good food choices can help supplement level management as you speak to your doctor. Your needs will vary depending on your age, health conditions and hormonal status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Milan_Jovic/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach, kale and collard greens contain a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/different-types-of-magnesium/" target="_self"&gt;lot of magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which can help regulate &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/testosterone-levels-test/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;total and free testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. Research &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7830687/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;points to magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; as another nutrient that plays a role in low testosterone. Magnesium reduces &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5551541/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, or the body's imbalance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/antioxidant-rich-foods-and-why-you-need-more-antioxidants/" target="_self"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; and free radicals. Reducing oxidative stress benefits testosterone bioactivity because inflammation and oxidative stress can lower testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating leafy greens may help boost testosterone levels. However, if you're not a big green eater, beans, nuts and dark chocolate are also excellent sources of magnesium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish have a lot going for them in the testosterone department. They are great sources of "good fats" known as omega-3s, which are known to support heart and joint health. Research has revealed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33741447/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low-fat diets can be associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower testosterone levels. While we need more research to fully understand why this is, adding healthy fats to your diet, like fatty fish, can benefit your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not the only benefit of fatty fish. They have a high nutritional content of essential vitamins like zinc and vitamin D, which are crucial for healthy testosterone levels. Those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518189/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;less vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; tend to have lower testosterone levels than those with more vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take a fish oil supplement if you're not a fish eater. A 2020 study found that &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952327820301629" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;fish oil supplements with omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; boost testosterone in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cruciferous vegetables &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houman explained that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts can indirectly support healthier testosterone balance by lowering estrogen levels. They can do this because cruciferous vegetables have a compound called &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;indole-3-carbinol&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies suggest that indole-3-carbinol may slow cancer cell growth, though the research is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;DragonImages/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs can help maintain healthy testosterone levels because they contain vitamin D and healthy fats. They also contain the antioxidant selenium. Animal studies have found that selenium can increase &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257863/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257863/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22testosterone%20production%22}" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;testosterone production&lt;/a&gt;. However, it's important to remember that we don't have human studies to draw any conclusions about the extent of the relationship between selenium and testosterone. Regardless, eggs are highly nutritious and contain other testosterone-friendly nutrients. One smaller study found that eating the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/02000/whole_egg_vs__egg_white_ingestion_during_12_weeks.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;whole egg will be better&lt;/a&gt; for testosterone levels than egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avocados&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are a triple threat when it comes to boosting testosterone levels. They are a great source of healthy fats and magnesium and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Boron-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;contain boron&lt;/a&gt;, a trace element linked to testosterone production. One study found that within a week of taking boron supplements, testosterone levels in males &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4712861/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased up to 32%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oysters and other shellfish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Houman, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-zinc-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;zinc is an essential nutrient&lt;/a&gt; for testosterone synthesis in the testes. Oysters offer the most zinc per serving than any food. Other shellfish, like shrimp, clams, mussels, crab and lobster, have notable zinc levels. If seafood isn't your thing, red meat, pumpkin seeds and lentils are other zinc-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the benefits of zinc, oysters and other shellfish's antioxidant effect may boost testosterone by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556007/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increasing the efficiency of the Leydig cells&lt;/a&gt;, the primary source of testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-food-sources-of-zinc/" target="_self"&gt;15 Best Food Sources of Zinc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Select fruits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruits with flavonoid antioxidants, like pomegranates, berries and cherries, can help support testosterone production. A study of active young men found that drinking two cups of pure pomegranate juice each day for three weeks helped with muscle recovery, reduced inflammation and saw an &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.ajme.2017.03.005" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increase in testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil has several health benefits, like increasing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/naturally-boost-your-heart-health-with-these-5-foods/" target="_self"&gt;good cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and lowering &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/cholesterol-everything-you-should-know/" target="_self"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. There is also some evidence that it may increase testosterone. One small study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research of 60 young males discovered that a daily intake of around five teaspoons of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/02000/whole_egg_vs__egg_white_ingestion_during_12_weeks.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;extra virgin olive oil increased testosterone by 17%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reeder explained that gut health is gaining more attention for its role in hormone regulation. Fermented foods like yogurt and kimchi can indirectly support testosterone levels by ensuring your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5433529/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; is healthy. A healthy gut plays a role in inflammation and hormone metabolism, so eating &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/probiotic-foods-naturally-boost-gut-health/" target="_self"&gt;gut-friendly foods&lt;/a&gt; is always good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While eating these foods won't artificially raise testosterone beyond your body's natural capacity, they can help create the right environment for hormonal stability," Reeder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the best diet for boosting testosterone levels?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any balanced diet that includes testosterone-friendly foods is a good option. However, if you're looking for a specific diet to help you create meals, try the Mediterranean diet. It's rich in lean proteins, healthy fats and plenty of veggies. Houman explained that following a Mediterranean diet has been linked to higher testosterone levels and better reproductive health in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to follow the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/ultimate-guide-mediterranean-diet-2025-healthiest-diet/" target="_self"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; to boost your testosterone levels; you can focus on healthy eating habits to see the benefits. However, it's essential to acknowledge what not to do. Houman explained that ultra-processed foods and high-sugar diets can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11412839/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;suppress testosterone&lt;/a&gt; by promoting insulin resistance.

Fats, especially those from whole food sources, provide cholesterol, a crucial building block for hormone production," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't cut out all fats from your diet or you may see a hormone level drop. Instead, focus on high-quality fats and moderate how often you eat processed foods. If you don't know where to start with your diet or how to recognize your food patterns, working with a registered dietitian can help you find a diet that works best for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other natural ways to boost testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with the foods you eat, though your diet isn't the only thing that could impact your testosterone levels.

Beyond confirming the presence of the disease, the test also helps determine the stage of its progression. This may fundamentally change how physicians manage Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test was developed by experts at &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; and Lund University in Sweden. Their studies indicate that a particular blood protein, MTBR-tau243, can be used to monitor the extent of dangerous tau accumulation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tangles of tau protein are some of the hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer’s and are directly proportional to the intensity of the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technique is considerably more convenient than brain scans since it is non-invasive, and does not require expensive procedures that are difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-alzheimer-s-with-a-blood-test"&gt;Tracking Alzheimer’s with a blood test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, doctors can use several blood &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-tests-offer-new-hope-in-detecting-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; to help detect Alzheimer’s. Some of the tests that are already in use are based on earlier discoveries at Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests look for early warning signs but don’t reveal how much the disease has progressed. That’s a crucial gap. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medical-breakthrough-new-vaccine-may-prevent-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s treatments&lt;/a&gt; are most helpful in the early stages, before too much damage has been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a way to tell whether someone is in an early or late phase of the disease would help doctors decide which treatment would work best. It could also clarify whether a person’s memory or thinking issues are actually caused by Alzheimer’s or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer’s tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer’s symptoms and dementia,” said co-senior author Dr. Randall J. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In clinical practice right now, we don’t have easy or accessible measures of Alzheimer’s tangles and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and so a tangle blood test like this can provide a much better indication if the symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s and may also help doctors decide which treatments are best for their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-reliable-way-to-monitor-the-disease"&gt;A reliable way to monitor the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s typically starts with a buildup of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleeping-may-lower-levels-of-alzheimers-abnormal-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid protein&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Tau tangles develop later and mark the point when symptoms begin to show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to see these changes has been through PET scans, which can track amyloid and tau deposits. But these scans are expensive, time-consuming, and often only available in large hospitals or research centers. That’s why scientists have been working on blood-based alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team had already developed blood tests that measure amyloid plaque buildup. Earlier research showed that levels of MTBR-tau243 in spinal fluid could match up with brain tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the researchers demonstrated that they could get the same results using blood samples. A blood draw is much easier and more accessible than a spinal tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-the-new-approach"&gt;Testing the new approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the test, the researchers used data from two groups of people. One group came from a research center at Washington University and included 108 volunteers. The other group included 55 people from a Swedish study known as BioFINDER-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the experts checked their findings with data from 739 additional people in the BioFINDER-2 group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants represented a range of Alzheimer’s stages – from people who had no symptoms but had amyloid in their brains, to those with mild cognitive issues, to people with full dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included individuals with memory or thinking problems due to other conditions, and some who were cognitively healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-progression-revealed-in-blood"&gt;Alzheimer’s progression revealed in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were promising. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood matched the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people and those in the earliest stage of the disease, the levels were normal. But in people showing symptoms, the protein levels were clearly elevated – and much higher in those with advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difference made it easy to tell who was in an early or late stage of Alzheimer’s. It also helped distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from other kinds of cognitive problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of clarity could make a huge difference in choosing the right treatment path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test uses technology licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics, which previously developed similar blood tests for amyloid plaques. The earlier tests were designed to detect another tau protein called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe we will use blood-based p-tau217 to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, but MTBR-tau243 will be a highly valuable complement in both clinical settings and research trials,” said Oskar Hansson, a professor of neurology at Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When both of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-earliest-biomarker-protein-psd-95-identified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are positive, the likelihood that Alzheimer’s is the underlying cause of a person’s cognitive symptoms increases significantly, compared to when only p-tau217 is abnormal. This distinction is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-to-better-treatments"&gt;Looking ahead to better treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are two FDA-approved drugs that target amyloid in the brain to slow Alzheimer’s. But more treatments are being tested – including ones that aim at tau protein and other disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these therapies become available, doctors will need reliable ways to match the right treatment to each stage of the disease. Blood tests could be the key to this shift toward personalized Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re about to enter the era of personalized medicine for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Kanta Horie, a research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For early stages with low tau tangles, anti-amyloid therapies could be more efficacious than in late stages. But after the onset of dementia with high tau tangles, anti-tau therapy or one of the many other experimental approaches may be more effective.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have a clinically available blood test for staging, plus treatments that work at different stages of the disease, doctors will be able to optimize their treatment plans for the specific needs of each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 14:42:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNYjJfS1BLUVRaenQ4TXJING5RZnpNbDByS2VZYzgxY3hQR3JPalp6NWk4WVl5NmMySk5mT1JCbGxHTm85YVhiaEs0UHdUcFV0ZjdrNVctdDdKTEFRRnh2RjYxWUhBS3FsSm5XcDZ4U2s3SW9rQi1PS3luVFFySmozSlhLRVU1cTY2MlE</guid></item><item><title>Protein Is Being Added To Yogurt, Bread and Even Coffee – But Is It Really Good For Our Health? - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5kOWhfV2FhZUNJRjE3dWxhT3ljUDdyeTg3STJCVXI0dmFXczVBU28tTVVzSlFWeThWMUd6b1NYbGRna3llMVJqelNMXzNRQW9velJ4MlU2X2FOdV9vQ2tkN25KckNrNXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="" alt="Whey protein shake with chocolate flavor." data-lazy-src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_223506822-1200x800.jpeg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AdobeStock_223506822-1200x800.jpeg" alt="Whey protein shake with chocolate flavor."&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Protein powder (© expressiovisual - stock.adobe.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein intake dominates fitness advice. Whether you want to build muscle, improve your fitness or watch your weight, the common advice handed out by everyone from fitness influencers to doctors is that we need more protein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/protein/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; does play an essential role in maintaining our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38840697/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle mass and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, all this increased attention on the importance of protein &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/high-protein-food-diet-recipes-dr-rupy-aujla-b2720439.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;in the media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a754243/how-much-protein-should-i-eat-to-build-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;fitness circles&lt;/a&gt; has sparked a surge in products marketed specifically for their protein content. Some chocolate bars, ice cream, pizza, coffee and even alcoholic beverages now &lt;a href="https://www.bevindustry.com/articles/97003-protein-flexes-its-muscles-as-consumers-look-to-add-more-protein-to-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;market themselves as protein foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But our enthusiasm for protein might have gone too far. While protein is certainly important for our health, most of us don’t need these protein-enhanced foods as a regular feature in our diet. Not to mention that this marketing may lead to a &lt;a href="https://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(19)30614-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;“halo effect,”&lt;/a&gt; where consumers mistakenly equate high protein content with &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/8/1139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;overall nutritional value&lt;/a&gt;. This effect can lead to the perception of protein-rich foods being inherently nutritious – even though many may not be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionespen.com/article/S2405-4577(24)00176-1/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;maintaining muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10259402/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nutrition guidelines recommend people aim to eat &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coma-reports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;around 0.75g of protein&lt;/a&gt; per kilogram of body weight. But &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11329409/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;some evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; this recommendation &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770723001446?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;may be an underestimate&lt;/a&gt; – and that the recommendation should be around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26960445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1.2g-1.6g per kg of body weight per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also a strong body of evidence that suggests the amount of protein we need changes depending on our health. For instance, people need to eat more protein when they’re &lt;a href="https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03693-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;recovering from an illness&lt;/a&gt;. Research also shows that &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(13)00326-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; should be aiming for at least 1.2g per kg of body weight in order to combat &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/78/Supplement_1/67/7199271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age-related muscle loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/athletes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Athletes&lt;/a&gt; also need to eat a greater amount of protein to &lt;a href="https://origin.health.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2014-june_elevate_health.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;support their training and recovery&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, with the rising popularity of weight-loss drugs, strategies increasingly emphasize protein intake to &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/73/Supplement_1/14-PUB/156089/14-PUB-The-Effect-of-Structured-Intensive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;minimize muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; while losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But just because protein is good for maintaining &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/vegan-protein-muscle-meat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, that doesn’t mean more is better. In fact, it seems that even when we &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5828430/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;consume large amounts of protein&lt;/a&gt;, only a some of this is actually used by the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of us probably need a little more protein than current guidelines suggest, but less than is often promoted by wellness influencers on social media (with some even suggesting we need up to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/wolfcoach_/reel/DCUyAeJIH7K/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;3g of protein per kg of body weight&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the necessary amount of protein suggested by emerging evidence (&lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/apnm-2020-0760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;1.2g-1.6g&lt;/a&gt; per kg of body weight per day) is close to what the &lt;a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/news/key-findings-from-ndns-report-for-years-9-to-11-combined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;average protein consumption already is&lt;/a&gt; in most western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people can probably benefit from being more protein aware – not about how much protein they’re consuming, but about the quality and frequency of their protein choices. Ideally, we should aim to consume small amounts of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-food-for-protein-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protein-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; more often during the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current evidence suggests around &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;20g-30g of protein&lt;/a&gt; (around a handful of a protein source) at each meal supports muscle maintenance alongside physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, this protein would come from whole foods (such as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/nuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds, milk, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; and legumes). But fortified protein products may have their space as a quick and easy snack – especially for those who may struggle to eat this much protein at each meal. It’s important to eat these foods in moderation, however.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ultra-processed-products"&gt;Ultra-processed products&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets are full of “protein-enhanced” products. But while these products may contain additional protein, they may also contain &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/added-sugar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;additional sugars&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/carbohydrates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;carbohydrates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, protein milk often contains &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/student-contributors-health-and-nutrition/high-protein-milk-its-not-just-milk-added-protein-powder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;double the protein&lt;/a&gt; of regular milk. It does this by removing water or adding dried milk. Protein bars are another example. But depending on the brand you choose, alongside their additional protein content they may also be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/well/eat/protein-bars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;high in sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many protein-fortified products share another common trait: they fall into the category of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. Ultra-processed foods are &lt;a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/news/position-statement-on-the-concept-of-ultra-processed-foods-upf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;commercially made products&lt;/a&gt; that include ingredients you wouldn’t typically find in your own kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/ultra-processed-food-silent-killer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; regularly consuming ultra-processed foods is consistently linked with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38363072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;poorer health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; – such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Current discussions around ultra-processed foods suggests uncertainty regarding whether it’s the processing itself, the poor nutritional quality of these foods or the combination of both of these factors that contribute to these negative health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another issue with protein-enhanced products is that while they do indeed contain extra protein, some products &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-scoop-on-protein-powder-2020030918986"&gt;may lack fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins and essential minerals. A &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(23)00363-1/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;lack of fiber&lt;/a&gt; in modern diets is currently one of the biggest contributors to population-wide ill-health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All foods have their place within &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;. But protein is only one component of overall nutritional health. The rise in protein-fortified foods as health foods is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protein-enhanced products are occasional foods that might support meeting protein intake, but they should not be mistaken for universally &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthy-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy foods&lt;/a&gt;. For people looking to reach their protein goals, choose a variety of protein sources, consider the role of convenience foods within the context of whole diet and think about other nutrients like fibre to really maximise health.&lt;/p&gt;
