As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fermented-foods-for-brain-health-8729105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease. They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Review Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worth adding to your routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A2 kefir made from A2 milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:water kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry-Kefir Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ranch dressing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the MIND diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t great for your brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-alzheimers-study-11707164" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:05:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBmeHA0RE10NnZsRXdYRmZsTVpzdWdYZGdyTkJNUUpDNGFOSWk2X1ZNeEZjUksxX1B0NGhYeHoydXdnWUpZcTc1YXcwUlRhRHd6S045R2JVZ1RNUUNjSzhlOWZvZHZaR2c2MEJuTUxmellPUElHRUE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County records first measles case in 12 years - WOODTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNZVZBaGRyRVFzcEhackhHZU0wcDZBcUoybC1USEVDbllGVG41Q2pkQnBjYmtBNEw4eHFiTnlKVWQxWjBWMmxGOE5DUVY4cmpYczB0bnlvUWFxaG8yWXZlU3hTbXE1dC1ydkJVVHgySTE0ZUFGOVVEUUJLUmxxbWNtcmRwam9reXRuSnZkel9lR0NRYUtiRkHSAZsBQVVfeXFMUDVCSWVvRDQtVjRkNHpBMzc0TE0zLTdXRE1ZYk55MkdFQlFRLVA1ZGlDMGZmanlOMHJMUmdRZFZSTkwzWHNEaHNWWkd6TFZqQ096Uy1aVjBNeEF6TGM3MzUyZDF1TmdUZHNBWFlEVjdSbHpLd3RDWGdJUlZrNW5PeHlHbUdNNHh3TFNnclF3czg2TkN3R3d2d0p0TjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More than five years since COVID was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19"&gt;declared a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, we’re still facing the regular emergence of new variants of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest variant on the rise is LP.8.1. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;increasing in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, making up close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;one in five COVID cases&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere it’s become even more dominant, comprising at least three in five cases &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is LP.8.1? And is it cause for concern? Let’s look at what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An offshoot of Omicron&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LP.8.1 was first &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;detected in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a descendant of Omicron, specifically of KP.1.1.3, which is descended from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285"&gt;JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, a subvariant that caused large waves of COVID infections around the world in late 2023 and early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) designated LP.8.1 as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt; in January. This was in response to its significant growth globally, and reflects that it has genetic changes which may allow the virus to spread more easily and pose a greater risk to human health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, LP.8.1 has mutations at six locations in its spike protein, the protein which allows SARS-CoV-2 to attach to our cells. One of these mutations, V445R, is thought to allow this variant to spread more easily relative to other circulating variants. V445R has been shown to increase binding to human lung cells in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext"&gt;laboratory studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The proportion of COVID cases caused by LP.8.1 has been rising in New South Wales.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;NSW Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the symptoms of LP.8.1 don’t appear &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;to be any more severe&lt;/a&gt; than other circulating strains. And the WHO has evaluated the additional public health risk LP.8.1 poses at a global level to be low. What’s more, LP.8.1 remains a variant under monitoring, rather than a variant of interest or a variant of concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these changes to the virus with LP.8.1 are small, and not likely to make a big difference to the trajectory of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;That doesn’t mean cases won’t rise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID as a whole is still a major national and international health concern. So far this year there have been close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;45,000 new cases recorded in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, while around &lt;a href="https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-hospitalised/aus"&gt;260 people are currently in hospital&lt;/a&gt; with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because many people are no longer testing or reporting their infections, the real number of cases is probably far higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;COVID is still around.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/asian-traveler-business-man-wearing-face-1739402366"&gt;Hananeko_Studio/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, LP.8.1 has become the &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;third most dominant strain in NSW&lt;/a&gt; (behind &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/xec-is-now-in-australia-heres-what-we-know-about-this-hybrid-covid-variant-239292"&gt;XEC&lt;/a&gt; and KP.3). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;has been growing&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of months and this trend looks set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say it’s not growing similarly in other states and territories, however NSW Health publishes &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/reports.aspx"&gt;weekly respiratory surveillance&lt;/a&gt; with a breakdown of different COVID variants in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequences of LP.8.1 in the &lt;a href="https://gisaid.org/"&gt;GISAID database&lt;/a&gt;, used to track the prevalence of variants around the world, increased from &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;around 3%&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2024 to 38% of global sequences as of &lt;a href="https://x.com/Mike_Honey_/status/1905816340331728914"&gt;mid March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries it’s climbed particularly high. In the United States LP.8.1 is responsible for &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;55% of cases&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;, where LP.8.1 is making up at least 60% of cases, scientists fear &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/science/new-covid-wave-cases-hospitalisations-3611459?srsltid=AfmBOor_V7pQrPMPhUYQA2KCZgRfsI_CpxTwIRiHDFJHIJhq2kbAmD42"&gt;it may be driving a new wave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will COVID vaccines work against LP.8.1?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current COVID vaccines, including the most recently available &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;JN.1 shots&lt;/a&gt;, are still expected to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;offer good protection&lt;/a&gt; against symptomatic and severe disease with LP.8.1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, due to its designation as a variant under monitoring, WHO member countries will continue to study the behaviour &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;of the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, including any potential capacity to evade our immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there’s no cause for panic due to LP.8.1 variant at this stage, COVID can still be a severe disease for some. Continued vigilance and vaccination, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;for medically vulnerable groups&lt;/a&gt;, is essential in minimising the impact of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But it’s not just a matter of getting enough rest. Sleeping late and less than five hours a day can impact your health in various ways. Dr Dheeraj Kapoor, head of endocrinology at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, tells Lata Mishra why getting your daily dose of shuteye is important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How does poor sleep affect metabolism and blood sugar regulation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation are two critical factors that contribute to conditions like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and fatty liver disease. Sleep deprivation, defined as getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep, and disrupted sleep quality, where a person frequently wakes up at night, both increase the risk of metabolic disorders. When sleep is compromised, the body produces excess cortisol, a stress hormone that heightens insulin resistance and increases the risk of diabetes. Additionally, hormonal imbalances occur — ghrelin (the hunger hormone) rises while leptin (which signals fullness) decreases, leading to increased appetite and cravings for high-calorie foods. Sleep deprivation also triggers inflammation and oxidative stress, further contributing to metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can just one night of poor sleep impact us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic sleep deprivation has a more profound impact, some studies indicate that even one night of poor sleep can elevate cortisol levels which, in turn, increases insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why is sleeping less than five hours and going to bed late harmful?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination disrupts the body’s circadian rhythm, the internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolic processes. When sleep duration is too short and occurs too late at night, cortisol production rises, insulin sensitivity decreases, and metabolic disorders become more likely. Night-shift workers and those who regularly stay up late are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome due to these disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;If someone gets eight-plus hours of sleep but goes to bed late, are they still at risk for metabolic issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. While getting adequate sleep is beneficial, the timing of sleep also matters. Sleeping after midnight disrupts the circadian rhythm which regulates physiological processes, including sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolism. It helps control insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. When disrupted — due to irregular sleep schedules, shift work, or sleeping late — metabolic processes get impaired, leading to increased risks of diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Do late sleepers tend to have poorer glucose control?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their disrupted circadian rhythms affect insulin function and glucose metabolism. They also tend to have irregular eating patterns, increased cravings for high-calorie foods, and higher cortisol levels, all of which contribute to poor glucose control. Night-time eating habits further exacerbate insulin resistance, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What about other disorders like PCOS, fatty liver disease, or high cholesterol? Are they caused by poor sleep too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Poor sleep affects hormone balance, leading to increased insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, which play key roles in conditions like PCOS, fatty liver disease, and high cholesterol. Sleep deprivation also promotes weight gain and inflammation, both of which contribute to these metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can exercise reduce the impact of sleep loss on insulin sensitivity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Exercise, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training, can help reduce some of the negative effects of sleep loss by improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function. However, exercise should ideally be done in the morning, afternoon, or early evening rather than right before bedtime, as late-night workouts can increase adenosine levels and interfere with sleep quality. Also, reducing screen time before bed and avoiding caffeinated drinks can further support better sleep quality and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why does caffeine consumption disrupt sleep more as we age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks adenosine, a chemical that promotes sleep. As individuals age, the body’s ability to metabolise caffeine slows down, making its effects last longer. Older adults are also more sensitive to sleep disturbances, meaning even a small amount of caffeine consumed in the evening can lead to prolonged wakefulness and fragmented sleep. Additionally, age-related changes in sleep patterns, such as lighter sleep and increased awakenings, make the effects of caffeine more pronounced. It is recommended that older adults reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening to improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are some effective strategies for improving sleep hygiene?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep hygiene involves adopting healthy habits that promote restful sleep. Some effective strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps regulate the body’s internal clock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a comfortable sleep environment: Keeping the bedroom dark, quiet, and cool can enhance sleep quality. Using blackout curtains, white noise machines, and comfortable bedding can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding stimulants before bedtime: Caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals should be avoided in the evening to prevent sleep disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in relaxation techniques: Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or light stretching before bed can help relax the mind and body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting regular physical activity: Exercising during the day promotes better sleep, but vigorous workouts should be avoided close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQMW1sWHdqSHdQNkNJT2JtMnI0Y1NwaDBnTDBFT08xOTFGWXVnTUZXX2lrVnIwR2tqMkhjN3gtYzZ2UUR3MzBrdGdnaEV3eWhaRUpXR0daT1B3ZXg0WFptcHhUSTBGMVhGak5zMEZqVklybVIwWXZycWhuMFFXRl9tcDQ0b05meThvQjNLSTd5MWFPQURvbDNValJNVmR2bWgtZTEtd2hXYllWaTNvanoyQUlqXzg0NHpURXJnV1Juak5EYWpwTVBsSV9pTDhoa3hDejBrQ3hlcUVxSjluN0F3Z1hVci1Ib0xMQjRiMDJtWTlKYUk4alE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County sees first measles case in over a decade, exposure locations and dates listed - WZZM13.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxOZ1hnaS1KZXVtcW1ORmNuRkFqOFhIb01zV0toRjRWZXVubnFBMF9jRlQzd1pQM1MxYnEwaW5BNlk0ekNZSTRsSXU0a2R5T0VTNUwxcHBsbjg0WXhCVjNsUW9DdC1FNEVvZjVkT203cE5YUWt2UnpXTVNCbDhMa1JaYTVmS3VWQWU5TU1nTUFXckttWGNfMlFfalFpUG5IZmRKV09RQ0M0eUZaRnBNTXBzZ1cxY0pWSFR2a3FtWlBibzFhRVc0bkRjNFdzaE9wS2ZrRVNHWllR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Kent County confirmed its first measles case in over a decade and listed times and places community members may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KENT COUNTY, Mich. — Kent County hasn't seen a case of seen a case of the measles since 2013, until now.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kent County Health Department said on Tuesday that in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, they confirmed a case of measles in a Kent County resident.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in Kent County is Michigan's second case this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease that continues to circulate both in the U.S. and globally," said Dr. Adam London, Health Officer at the KCHD. "This case is a reminder of how quickly measles can spread and the importance of vaccination. We urge residents to check their immunization status and to get vaccinated, especially if planning to travel internationally or into areas with active measles outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said that the infected person is an adult and had recently traveled abroad before returning to the U.S. and traveling between Michigan and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department listed the following locations where individuals may have been exposed on specific dates:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves, continuing to infect others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin 7-14 days after exposure, according to the health department, though they can surface as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department shared the following list of symptoms to watch for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104°F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of mouth (Koplik Spots) 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs 3-5 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department advised anyone who was at any of the above locations during the specified times should monitor for these symptoms for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged to call their healthcare provider before seeking in-person care to prevent further spread. The KCHD can be reached Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 616-632-7228. Individuals can call 2-1-1 for support during weekends and evenings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in young children, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems," said Dr. Kristin Oldenberg, Medical Director at KCHD. “Fortunately, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles. Two doses of the vaccine provide 97% protection against the disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of all dementia cases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-review-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Review Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This was compared to those with levels above 3.4 mmol/L - the higher end of a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking statins saw those with LDL cholesterol levels below 1.8 mmol/L reduce their dementia risk by a further 13 per cent and 12 per cent for Alzheimer’s compared with people who do not take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings emphasise the importance of targeted LDL- C management as part of dementia prevention strategies, with potential integration into clinical guidelines,” the authors wrote in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results support the use of statin therapy within specific LDL- C ranges for both cardiovascular and cognitive health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deadly fungus is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/dangerous-fungus-spreading-in-us-hospitals-has-rapidly-increased/"&gt;spreading like crazy&lt;/a&gt; across the United States, sickening and killing hospital patients — and the federal response has been ineffectual at best.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been found in 29 states since 2016, including New York, and the increase in affected patients is soaring year by year, the American Journal of Infection Control has found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the drug-resistant Candida auris fungus an  “urgent” threat, but talk is cheap. The agency is largely to blame for its rapid spread.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a textbook example of a federal agency crying out for the Trump administration’s reform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A shockingly high number of those who contract this hospital-based germ — between 30% and 60% — die.  To put that in perspective, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 1.1%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the CDC reported 4,514 cases of C. auris infection in patients of all ages — nine times larger than that seen in the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/us-news/measles-outbreak-hits-483-cases-in-21-states-most-in-texas/"&gt;measles outbreak &lt;/a&gt;that has drawn significant public concern.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/h2&gt;
		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leftists are moaning that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/01/us-news/hhs-starts-parting-with-10000-workers-as-rfk-jr-s-overhaul-plans-come-together/"&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Tuesday job cuts&lt;/a&gt;, which included 2,400 CDC staffers, will imperil our health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonsense: The agency, more fittingly called the Centers for Disaster and Confusion, has fallen far short of its core mission of stopping the spread of contagious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by fighting this dangerous new infection, Kennedy can get the agency back on track.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Here’s your to-do list, Mr. Secretary: Prioritize health over political correctness, opt for transparency over secrecy, and deploy new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, put a stop to woke distractions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, while C. auris cases soared by 500%, the CDC was busy scolding health-care workers about gender-specific terms like “mother” and “father” and stigmatizing words like “smoker” and “prisoner.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous. Cutting the CDC’s language police won’t harm our health a bit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, provide transparency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not just price transparency, Republicans’ favorite cure-all, but &lt;em&gt;information &lt;/em&gt;transparency. “Bad care is a bad deal at any price,” says Leah Binder of patient-safety watchdog Leapfrog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once C. auris invades a hospital, it clings to furniture, ceiling tiles, curtains, mattresses and equipment like blood-pressure monitors and wheelchairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When patients are exposed to the fungus it attaches to their skin — and it’s virtually impossible to get rid of it. A small number develop life-threatening infections, but many more become carriers indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they’re later admitted to another hospital, they shed the fungus there, unknowingly spreading it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to be treated in a hospital struggling with this contagion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC hides which hospitals have it — protecting the hospital’s reputation, but not stopping the spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, when the fungus invaded a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/20/why-the-coverup-over-naming-hospitals-where-kids-are-dying-from-fungus/"&gt;Las Vegas hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated echocardiogram equipment, a newborn died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC only revealed the details a year later — in a report that referred to the outbreak site as “Hospital A.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If you’re about to give birth, you need to know whether the hospital you’re planning to use is battling C. auris.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That “Hospital A” jargon is no exception. The CDC &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; identifies hospitals or nursing facilities battling any type of infection. That’s unfair to the public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the CDC must join us in the 21st century. The agency’s infection-control guidance for hospitals is straight out of the 1950s.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It recommends using “EPA-approved detergents” — known to be ineffective against C. auris — and discusses changing water in buckets and laundering mop heads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No mention of new technologies that can continuously and nontoxically decontaminate rooms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed medical journals, the gold standard, have demonstrated cutting-edge methods of ridding hospital rooms of C. auris. For example, dry hydrogen peroxide emitted through the HVAC system reduced fungal contamination in a Florida hospital’s burn unit by 93%&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Las Vegas hospital used the method to reduce C. auris contamination on surfaces from 70% to just 17%, reducing the risk that patients will pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Far-UV light can also destroy hospital infection germs without posing any risk to human skin and eyes, according to data published just last month&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CDC is suspicious of solutions coming from the for-profit world, and the agency’s website and hospital guidelines reflect little awareness of what is technically possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one has suffered more from the agency’s backward thinking than our schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;During the COVID pandemic, numerous technologies could have been employed to get schools up and running relatively virus-free.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the CDC gave school administrators wacky, pointless advice to open the windows and keep desks six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The public deserves a CDC that can provide up-to-date scientific guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. Secretary, this is your roadmap. The CDC maintains hundreds of projects that have nothing to do with stopping infectious disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slash them and fortify the CDC to battle deadly contagions. Our lives could depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On March 21,&lt;/strong&gt; a remarkable photograph of an orca named Quiver blew up on the Facebook page of Washington State’s Orca Network Community Group, a grass-roots organization that helps monitor Puget Sound’s orca population. The moment was captured by a Whidbey Island-based photographer named Cindi Rausch. Having some years ago moved to the island from Texas, Rausch, a retired high school literature teacher, had never seen a whale of any sort until one day in 2021, when heading back to her car after a morning beach walk, she passed a group of bystanders, all armed with binoculars and long-lensed cameras.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Hey, where’ya going?” they inquired. “Whales are on the way!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Orcas, to be exact. But not just any old orcas, as Rausch would soon discover, when taking her place among the excited crowd, she immediately became captivated by the compelling story playing out in front of her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“I was told the orca family group approaching was designated T46,” Rausch recalls. “Which was primarily comprised of offspring of a very famous &lt;a href="https://www.theinertia.com/environment/kiler-whale-puget-sound-great-grand-calf-sea-world-orca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;female orca named ‘Wake.’&lt;/a&gt; In 1976, Wake and five other young orcas were captured and held in a netted pen in South Puget Sound for sale to various marine parks. This violent ‘orca roundup’ was witnessed by Washington governor’s aide &lt;a href="https://www.theinertia.com/environment/kiler-whale-puget-sound-great-grand-calf-sea-world-orca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ralph Munro&lt;/a&gt;, and the public outcry following his publicized first-hand account led not only to the release of Wake and the rest of the “Budd Inlet Six,” but a total ban on all orca capture in Washington state waters.”&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Quite understandably, Wake judiciously avoided all human contact until 13 years later, when she reemerged to public view accompanied by two daughters. Since that time, and until her death in 2023 at an estimated age of 57, Wake, as her family’s matriarch, is recognized by both researchers and orca-lovers alike as one of her species most prolific mothers. Having helped successfully rear a total of 27 offspring, she’s revered for the significant role she played in the current healthy state of today’s orca population.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This was Wake’s extended family Rausch was introduced to that day, and from that day on, she became a dedicated orca-watcher, fired by a combination of intellectual curiosity and awe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;“These are apex predators, powerful, fierce creatures with teeth that tear prey apart,” says Rausch. “There’s nothing in the water they fear. Yet at the same time, they’re sleek, graceful, incredibly social animals, and intensely loyal to their families. It’s this dichotomy that really got me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;That, and getting to know each member of this family individually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“After years of observation, you get to know every member of the T46 family by name,” Rausch explains. “Recognizing each not only by their distinctive dorsal fins and markings, but by their different personalities.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;On this particular afternoon, after receiving notification that the family group was sighted off Whidbey’s Keystone Inlet, Rausch, who out of sheer necessity had become an accomplished wildlife photographer, grabbed her big lens and rushed to the water’s edge. There she was just in time to document not only T46 members Thor, Loki, Strider, Quiver and Centeki successfully hunting down and killing an unlucky male Stellar sea lion, but the added presence of a lone outrigger canoe paddler (&lt;span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"&gt;which just happened to be me in my OC1&lt;/span&gt;), fortunate enough to find himself in the right place at the right time to witness the ensuing drama and its celebratory aftermath.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This particular photo really resonates because of the perspective,” says Rausch. “We usually only see the whale’s dorsal fin and back. It’s rare to see the full body, the whole whale. But with the juxtaposing of the paddler in the frame, you’re struck by the whale’s enormity. And this is just Quiver, one of the family’s younger, smaller orcas. Yet what also makes the photo interesting is how the paddler is looking at Quiver in such a relaxed manner, and Quiver is obviously looking back. It’s just one of those images that I never could’ve anticipated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This, and many other photos of the T46 family group, can be found at &lt;a href="https://cindirausch.smugmug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cindirausch.smugmug.org&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These cells produce IGF-1, a protein critical for forming the myelin sheath that helps nerve signals travel efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both mice and preterm infants exposed to maternal inflammation, researchers found decreased levels of IGF-1 and delayed myelination on MRI scans. The findings suggest a potential therapeutic target to protect infant brain development and reduce the long-term effects of prenatal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Cells Affected:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal inflammation reduces CD11c-positive microglia during development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myelination Delays:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower IGF-1 levels linked to disrupted myelin formation in infants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting microglia may prevent long-term neurodevelopmental delays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research group led by Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan has uncovered a potential mechanism linking maternal inflammation to delayed neurodevelopment in infants. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests the role of CD11c-positive microglia—immune cells in the brain crucial for myelination—during infant brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108344"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby's face and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;, suggest new strategies to mitigate the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of maternal inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation during pregnancy occurs when the mother’s immune system becomes activated during pregnancy, typically due to an infection, autoimmune response, or environmental factors. It can have negative outcomes for the baby, potentially causing long-term cognitive and behavioral challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team led by Kazuya Fuma and Tomomi Kotani has discovered the role of CD11c-positive microglia in this process. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, play a key role in myelination, the process where nerve fibers are coated with myelin. Myelin is essential for making the nerve cells able to transmit electrical signals efficiently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers tested mice that were exposed to maternal inflammation. They found that the proliferation of these cells was reduced. Then, to determine if these findings were relevant to humans, the researchers analyzed cord blood from preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis, a condition that causes inflammation during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found lower levels of IGF-1, a protein linked to CD11c-positive microglia, in their samples. When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation during pregnancy suppressed the increase in CD11c microglia that we usually see during typical infant development,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CD11c microglia have been reported to be involved in myelination by being a major source of IGF-1. In the present study, both were decreased in inflammation during pregnancy, suggesting that this pathway is impaired in children with delayed neurodevelopment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sheds light on the complex relationship between maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment. The researchers hope that understanding the role of CD11c-positive microglia in neurodevelopment will lead to new therapeutic strategies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If future studies confirm a decrease in these microglia in preterm infants exposed to inflammatory conditions, such as chorioamnionitis, early interventions could be developed to prevent or reduce the neurodevelopmental impact of maternal inflammation,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting CD11c-positive microglia, it may be possible to protect infants from the long-term consequences of impaired myelination and improve their chances for healthy cognitive development.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb8288848686b4998e988e8a998883ab9fc5868a8287c5858a8c84928ac69ec58a88c5819b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthew Coslett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nagoya-u.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matthew Coslett – Nagoya University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07511-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Kazuya Fuma et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) is a form of maternal immune activation (MIA) linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our previous study identified neurodevelopmental impairments in an MIA mouse model mimicking HCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, this study investigated the role of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia, key contributors to myelination through IGF-1 production, in this pathology. In the mouse model, the CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population was significantly lower in the MIA group than in the control group on postnatal day 3 (PN3d).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, myelination-related protein levels significantly decreased in the MIA group at PN8d. In humans, preterm infants with HCA exhibited higher IL-6 and IL-17A cord-serum levels and lower IGF-1 levels than those without HCA, followed by a higher incidence of delayed myelination on magnetic resonance imaging at the term-equivalent age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In silico analysis revealed that the transient induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during early development occurred similarly in mice and humans. Notably, a lack of high CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population has been observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reports impaired induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during postnatal development in a mouse model of MIA associated with delayed myelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings may inform strategies for improving outcomes in infants with HCA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:58:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPM1ZGYWJtM205ZjhGQVJCSTI2alpSbW9lSWVNbl9icGkxS2ZfUy1jajF2WjhQQ0dBQlU0a0RkX3cxNzNUVmJsbXpwVi0yclk4R2lDcU41czlEZHVoeWdlYjl1M0tCQnRGT2tyd095VmZyNVFCR3BvNXhrNUlDMlVCc1hvRHVobnRJ</guid></item><item><title>Dozens of free measles vaccine clinics close in Texas as federal funding is cut - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQZ3ZLNFcxdkExVDRBa25VaWhVUWNWand5dXkzTjhXY2FyeVdEMkpnTFBubzgyX1NfQWdxRWpsSHJCOUx4WThHTDMwQ3ZtT3dMTFM3QlhOS0VRalhnc0FETVlTbWJYY2lkeDE0SkFFd0FqNkZCT3diSHRNam9DazdwUEJMemVyOEY5RGEzVHp3Z0Vyb0M0RFdyb3RHQTZFSXB6R0k0dllZNGVPbUdLZlHSAVZBVV95cUxOVmVVZTE1R1pJeUE3Q2dScjRJZkplN0xCQWl3aU9iNHlDaUc2SUkyaVUtdlYzWHNxYWp2d3I4U3RsT0NyMzVhRmtEei0xSDFsb0kwZ2ltdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;Steep federal funding cuts &lt;/a&gt;have forced public health officials in one of Texas’ most populous counties — Dallas — to cancel dozens of vaccination clinics and lay off 21 workers on the front lines of combatting the state’s growing measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we’ve had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Many of the clinics had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The vaccines, which included measles, mumps and rubella shots, were meant to be given free to families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The money being cut — $11.4 billion nationwide — was originally allocated to aid community health departments during the pandemic. Local public health officials have more recently been using the Covid funds for other public health initiatives, such as measles prevention, surveillance and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last week however, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars&lt;/a&gt; responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s very short-sighted and not understanding of the way public health works,” Huang said. “Being prepared for Covid helps build our capacity to be able to respond to other issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Huang said his team was still assessing the exact amount of money slashed in his budget, but estimated it to be in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of Tuesday, 422 measles had been reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.

MDGA2 typically keeps BDNF/TrkB signaling in check, but when MDGA2 levels drop, heightened neuronal activity and social impairments occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with reduced MDGA2 showed behaviors resembling autism, including repetitive grooming and social withdrawal. Treatment with a peptide that mimics MDGA2 restored balance and eased symptoms, suggesting a potential pathway for future autism therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Low MDGA2 disrupts BDNF/TrkB signaling, triggering ASD-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Affected mice showed repetitive behaviors and social deficits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Mimicking MDGA2 reduced symptoms, pointing to new treatment avenues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In mice, autism symptoms arise when a certain pair of competing nerve proteins falls out of equilibrium, according to a study published April 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; by Dongdong Zhao of Wenzhou Medical University, China, Yun-wu Zhang of Xiamen University, China, and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1% of the world population is considered to have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), exhibiting a series of social and cognitive symptoms.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Zhao, Zhang and colleagues used mice to examine the activity of two neuronal proteins suspected to be linked to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDGA2 is a protein involved in the transmission of nerve signals, and certain mutations in the &lt;em&gt;MDGA2&lt;/em&gt; gene have been identified in ASD patients. Experimental trials revealed that mice with reduced levels of MDGA2 exhibited ASD-like symptoms, including repetitive grooming and altered social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice also exhibited increased activity in certain nerve synapses and increased levels of BDNF, another neuronal protein that has been linked to ASD and functions through binding and activating the TrkB protein. When these mice were treated with an artificial peptide that mimicked MDGA2 and inhibited BDNF/TrkB activity, the symptoms lessened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results combined with previous research, the authors suggest that MDGA2 and BDNF maintain a natural balance by competing with each other for TrkB protein binding sites, and disruption to this system can lead to regulatory changes in neuron activity related to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protein system might be a promising target for future therapeutic treatments, but further investigation will be required into the exact functions of this system and its relationship to ASD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yun-wu Zhang adds, “Mutations in the &lt;em&gt;MDGA2 &lt;/em&gt;gene causes autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but the underlying mechanism is elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study reveals a novel role of MDGA2 in keeping the BDNF/TrkB signaling at bay for normal excitatory neuronal activity, and demonstrates that MDGA2 deficiency results in aberrant BDNF/TrkB activation and elevated excitatory neuronal activity, leading to ASD-like phenotypes in mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82001442 to D.Z., and 82130039 and U21A20361 to Y.-w.Z.), and Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2020M671948 to D.Z., and 2022M722651 to Y.H.).

Both loss of MDGA2 and the ASD-associated MDGA2 V930I mutation promote the BDNF/TrkB signaling activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB signaling by both small molecular compound and MDGA2-derived peptide can attenuate the increase of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity and social deficits in MDGA2-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight a novel MDGA2-BDNF/TrkB-dependent mechanism underlying the synaptic function regulation, which may become a therapeutic target for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:24:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9oaUEtQkFoSTlaUEIyT1dLZUdtV2doYlFkSkFHdkZYYjRZN1paVGpSZDBEMFQtMFoySjdkS1BNT0xpdzAtYzY4NG50YlFEZ1VKRWFfVzdBMVh2QXN2S0RzeWNsanlKV2s</guid></item><item><title>Hidden Heart Risks: Antidepressants Linked to Sudden Cardiac Death - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:11:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c</guid></item><item><title>New study says Lexington has among the highest STI rates in the country - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOHZ5c1V6Yi1rLUdYZFI0dkg1dU5UaGprTzAtSTVIdi1VeHd3cWNOQU8zTEtCRUxEcG5PNnBIc1VEVVZJeG9SQlhPTGlHd2tuRUlrVlRXZFB5RndKOEh6S2gzaWtQekZvaEtJMnpDS2VqNU1iQ19FeElQMTh6aE9ncXBzMnVxSkQtVXdCUmNjbjNLS1BBVGRHcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LEXINGTON, Ky.

Because it might lead to being able to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McDonough explained that Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, and that it's characterized by a buildup of harmful toxins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we could clear waste in the brain, pathology would never have a chance to clump and damage neurons and therefore, cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease would not occur (and no Alzheimer's diagnosis would occur either),' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But McDonough explained that all of this research is pretty new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as of right now, we don't have good ways to clear brain waste in humans through a procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that this doesn't mean that there's no other possible way to slow the potential diagnosis of Alzheimer's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Several lifestyle factors may help the brain naturally clear our waste like increasing the quality of one's sleep,' McDonough said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By clearing up this 'brain waste,' researchers have the potential to prevent the effects of dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During sleep, the glymphatic system becomes especially active, flushing out the unwanted materials to keep your brain clean and healthy, much like a nightly cleanup that prevents buildup and potential damage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he explained that research done on aging mice has shown that regular aerobic exercise can boost the function of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McDounough said that this is the brain's cleaning network, and it's boosted by enhancing blood flow and arterial pulsation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research is showing that dementia can also be prevented with more education, correcting hearing loss, reducing cholesterol, reducing depression, increasing physical activity, reducing the likelihood of getting diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other things like eliminating smoking, obesity, lowering alcohol intake, increasing social activity, and reducing exposure to air pollution can also all aid at preventing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/10/26/over-70-of-americans-are-more-health-conscious/"&gt;As Americans become increasingly health-conscious&lt;/a&gt;, their online grocery orders are showing a shift toward more nutritious food choices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s according to Instacart, which recently revealed new dietary trends based on customers’ purchase and search data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using data from 2023 to 2024, the online grocery delivery platform calculated a 39% uptick in searches for “high protein,” as well as a 159% surge in searches for “high fiber.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instacart also said it’s seen a 9% increase in purchases of lower-sugar foods and beverages and an 8% spike in low-carb purchases since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other key findings as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly Springer, a registered dietitian in Skaneateles, New York, said she’s encouraged by the trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you are doing Instacart, you’re more likely to purchase those healthier food items than to be buying spur-of-the-moment-kind-of-foods in the food aisle,” she told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For its methodology, Instacart calculated the percentage difference in the share of orders that each category appeared in from 2023 to 2024. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the non-alcoholic cocktails category had a 350% increase in its share of orders in 2024 compared to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These trends are a reflection of how consumers are embracing more holistic and personalized approaches to health,” Alex Orellana, Instacart’s trends analyst, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“High-protein products remain popular not just for muscle building but also for boosting metabolism and energy, while fiber-rich foods are gaining momentum with increased awareness of the gut-brain connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orellana said low-carb diets also remain popular as they support stable energy levels and align with broader weight management and wellness goals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instacart has unearthed some additional predictions for the future of healthy eating this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/instacarts-flavorful-food-forecast-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flavorful food forecast&lt;/a&gt; for 2025, the company revealed major growth in prebiotic and probiotic beverages, with its order data showing 58% year-over-year growth in these two categories between 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that people are starting to listen about the correlation of digestive health to health in general,” Springer said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also a growing interest in tinned fish, a once-popular mealtime staple that had fallen out of favor in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to year-over-year growth in the share of orders containing canned mackerel and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/health/retiree-claims-she-lost-35-pounds-eating-sardines/"&gt;canned sardines&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 to 2024, these two tinned fishes displayed a 74% and 13% growth, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Springer said it’s “awesome” that omega-3s – essential fatty acids that help to reduce inflammation – “are really making headway.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People also can’t seem to get enough of enhanced water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Purchases of electrolyte drink powders between 2023 and 2024 showed a 36% increase, with the share of purchases of coconut water growing by 7% during the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All this data suggests that a health and wellness focus continues to influence Americans as they make their grocery shopping decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a dietitian, I couldn’t be prouder of Americans,” Springer said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;After last weekend’s showers and a week of heat forecast, conditions are ideal for mosquito reproduction, which has officials concerned over the spread of mosquito-borne disease. Last year, mosquito control across the state saw record numbers in travel-related cases of the mosquito-borne disease dengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s expecting another season of above-average numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be surprising if we aren't at the same level that we were last year,” said Steve Harrison, manager of Orange County Mosquito Control. “You could assume that going into the subsequent year that you're going to see a little more activity, because rarely does it drop off to extreme levels from year to year. It's normally a gradual decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue, also known as “bone break fever,” causes a variety of symptoms including fever, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and eye pain. In more severe cases, it can cause abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and bleeding from the gums or nose, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the state reported 911 travel-related cases, according to data from the Florida Department of Health. There were also 85 local cases reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How dengue goes from one country to another&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel-related cases are concerning because of how the dengue virus moves from person to person. Florida travelers may go to a dengue-endemic country, like Cuba, and return with the virus. If a Florida mosquito bites that traveler, that mosquito can then infect a Florida resident. If it happens enough times, the virus could become endemic in Florida. Increasing the virus’s odds of propagating are hotter temperatures and more rainfall, creating ideal breeding conditions for more mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrison said early projections of summer weather indicate mosquitoes should have a season to thrive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, looking at the trends, one would assume that we're probably going to see levels that we did last year, because people are still traveling as much,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, there have been no reported local cases of dengue throughout the state. However, there have been 49 travel cases as of week 12 of the year. Seven cases have been reported in Central Florida, including four from Orange County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that same 12-week time period last year, there were 77 cases. This year’s number, although lower, is still concerning considering it’s higher than the 6-year average (2020–2025) of 35 cases, and much higher than the 10-year average (2010-2019) of nine cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, dengue cases have been increasing globally for the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors are associated with the spread of dengue, including “climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall,” according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, FDOH listed 10 different Caribbean destinations where Florida travelers have picked up dengue. The top three were Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stop dengue from spreading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Mosquito Control teams are calling on residents to help lessen the chance of spreading dengue by tossing out basins of still water on their property, eliminating possible mosquito breeding grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Routinely go out to your yard. Make sure you're flushing out your bird baths. You're flushing out your potted plants, anything that can hold water. Toss out those containers,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is experiencing a large amount of mosquito activity at their home, they can reach out to mosquito control by calling the county line 311 or 407-836-3111.&lt;/p&gt;

Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right. While it’s certainly true that some cheeses are packed with saturated fats and sodium (and not much else), others boast enough vitamins, protein, and good bacteria to receive a gold star from any dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set out to determine the healthiest cheeses you can eat, consulting two nutritionists and a food scientist in our quest to determine which should earn a spot in this prestigious (to us, at least!) lineup. There were a lot of factors to consider. "Look at the nutrient density per calorie," &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rosemary Trout;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rosemary Trout&lt;/a&gt;, program director of culinary arts and food science at Drexel University, says. Opt for cheeses that are "low in saturated fat and sodium" and "high in protein, calcium, and probiotics," Jennifer Altman, PsyD, R.D., advises. With all that in mind, here are the five cheeses that took top honors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mozzarella&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PHOTO: LINDA PUGLIESE; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozzarella is a shoo-in in this healthy cheese bracket, boasting &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170845/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:six grams of protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;six grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; in just a one-ounce serving. In addition to being high in protein, it’s also "lower in saturated fat and sodium" and "a good source of calcium, phosphorus, and zinc, all essential nutrients for good bone health," Altman shares. Mozzarella also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29542032/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; bacterias Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum, two valuable probiotics that promote good gut health.

This is due to goat milk’s "higher concentration of short-chain fatty acids compared to bovine milk," she explains. Kim Yawitz, R.D. and owner of &lt;a href="https://crossfit26.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Two Six Fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Two Six Fitness&lt;/a&gt; in St. Louis, MO, agrees, explaining that these smaller fat molecules are also “digested more quickly...which can help you feel fuller faster" and lead to "eating fewer calories at later meals." A cheese that comes with built-in portion control assistance? Yes, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;BHOFACK2 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;High in protein and loaded with valuable Vitamins B and B12, this creamy cheese has been a well-known health food for years. According to Yawitz, "one cup...contains 24 grams of muscle-building, belly-filling protein," making it a great option for people looking to double down on this important macronutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Yawitz shares that many cottage cheese brands "contain bacteria that can help bolster your immune system and improve digestion." Maybe it’s time to give that viral &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a61238259/cottage-cheese-bark-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cottage cheese bark;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cottage cheese bark&lt;/a&gt; a shot!

It’s also high in calcium, with &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170848/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:335 mg per ounce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;335 mg per ounce&lt;/a&gt; serving. On the flip side, parmesan is fairly high in sodium, so it’s not advised to eat in large amounts—especially if salt is a concern for you—but fortunately, it brings such a punch of flavor that most of us aren’t chomping through a whole block of it in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swiss Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;gaffera - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This famous holey cheese was &lt;a href="https://torontosun.com/2017/08/18/research-says-swiss-cheese-is-a-superfood" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shortlisted as a superfood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;shortlisted as a superfood&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 for containing a healthy probiotic bacterium called Propionibacterium freudenreichii. According to Yawitz, studies have suggested that this probiotic can "help decrease inflammation, fight off infection, and even slow the aging process." Beyond the benefits of this probiotic, Yawitz shares that Swiss cheese is also high in other key nutrients, including "Vitamin B12, calcium, and phosphorus." It’s also "a good source of protein and calcium, which are good for bone health," Altman says. When was the last time you had a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23872214/classic-reuben-sandwich-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reuben;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Reuben&lt;/a&gt;? Might want to get back on that train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But which cheese is the absolute healthiest? Well...it depends on your specific nutritional needs and health goals. If you’re looking for more protein in your diet, raid your local grocery store for cottage cheese and parmesan. If you’re concerned with the amount of sodium in your diet, grab a ball of mozzarella. And if you want to feel stronger, healthier, and possibly even live longer, reach for that block of Swiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:05:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxObDVLU0I2bkxMRE9MRHpmQUxTZHJyUHJnRDNlT2tKWjlpTkl4TEo3bUZ2VVAtam5UV2VTRjVBaURTSEppUXAtdlZjTkhpcEJpU1NEV21iLUJydUVBWEVmdmNiTUp6THpGQU9uN1hNUkdpN1loZlVKZDh3ZDJlOTV5Rw</guid></item><item><title>Fasting every other day outperforms calorie cutting, clinical trial indicates - upi.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNc254Z3oxcTVsYUYtS0NRWUh0N0NUc1pieDJRQ3hoSENlS2xVNDY1M2VicVFXLWpEM2dpSHF5SlpMRHNUTUtxTVRCSk0tUS0tdU5lQkdGSDl5VFBuOTRmQzQxT0xaQWk4MGdwN3VnUkhuQW9RTjRaQkI5WDdKM1VFeUZ0cjBtTWttTWhxdDJPWXhVN0djU2hHT1JKUm83QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-12 col-lg-7"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting every other day can prompt more weight loss than simply cutting calories, a new clinical trial shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who undertook 4:3 intermittent fasting lost just under 8% of their body weight within a year, compared to a 5% loss among people who cut their daily calories by about a third, researchers reported Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 4:3 intermittent fasting, people restrict their calorie intake by 80% three days a week, alternating between days with no dietary restrictions at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Long-term adherence to daily calorie restriction is challenging for many people," wrote the research team co-led by &lt;a href="https://cehhs.utk.edu/krss/4815-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Danielle Ostendorf&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of kinesiology, recreation and sport studies at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that 4:3 [intermittent] is an alternative dietary &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/nutrition/why-cant-i-lose-weight-2659046552.html" target="_blank"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; strategy that may produce modestly superior weight loss compared with [daily calorie restriction] at 12 months, when provided in the context of a high-intensity, comprehensive behavioral weight loss program," the team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this trial, researchers assigned 84 overweight and obese people to this type of fasting, and another 81 folks to cut their calories by 34%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups were asked to get in 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week, double the amount recommended by U.S. physical activity guidelines. They also received support from a weight-loss program led by a registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year, the research team compared how the two groups did, and found that those who fasted lost slightly more weight on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, those who fasted had better odds of achieving the sort of weight loss that produces health benefits, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 38% of fasting participants lost at least 10% of their body weight by the end of the year, compared 16% of those who cut calories, the study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More people were able to stick with fasting. Nearly 30% of those assigned to calorie cutting dropped out of the study, compared with 19% of those in the fasting group, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks who fasted also tended to take in fewer calories overall, and had more improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alternative patterns of restricting dietary energy intake for weight loss are gaining attention due to the difficulty of adhering to a reduced-calorie diet on a daily basis," researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An appealing feature of [intermittent fasting] is that dieters do not have to focus on counting calories and restricting intake every day as they do with daily calorie restriction," they continued. "Furthermore, the periodic nature of fasting may mitigate the constant hunger associated with [daily calorie restriction]."

town at the center of a measles outbreak have been hospitalized after taking an unproven treatment touted by Robert F Kennedy Junior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have reported a handful of unvaccinated children in West Texas were treated for liver damage in the past two months thought to be linked to vitamin A poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-14454399/RFK-Jr-urges-vaccination-measles-Texas-outbreak.html"&gt;long-time vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, has strongly endorsed vitamin A as a treatment for measles despite the evidence being mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have shown that supplementation can reduce the risk of compilations and death in malnourished children with severely low levels of vitamin A, which is found in several foods including eggs, dairy, and cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other research has shown little benefit in children with adequate vitamin A levels, which is the case for most youngsters in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of overdosing comes from the fact high levels of vitamin A put significant stress on liver cells, potentially causing inflammation, cell death, and scarring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;400 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been identified in West Texas communities, where vaccination rates range from 30 to 60 percent, since January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-one patients have been hospitalized and at least one has died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has endorsed high doses of vitamin A supplements as a safe and effective treatment for measles despite years of scientific research failing to prove this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr recently directed the CDC to&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;

Further studies are necessary to define the optimal fasting schedule and delineate the health benefits. Unfortunately, no one method will work for all people.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Comparing different intermittent fasting regimens, and perhaps breaking down further by other variables such as age, gender, or ethnicity, may help define an optimal diet for a particular group of patients,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of the study were not completely surprising as this type of intermittent fasting may act similarly to ‘metabolic confusion’ or ‘calorie shifting’ which essentially can catch the body by surprise and ‘shake things up’ by oscillating between a calorie deficit and sufficiency in addition to burning calories with exercise between intervals of rest and action,” Richard, who was likewise not involved in the study, explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been research studies that have observed the positive benefits of these patterns, as in this study, but it is limited and overall success is highly variable and based on multiple factors unique to the individual and the study design methodology,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 4:3 intermittent fasting schedule calls for three days of fasting and four days of normal eating each week, that might be hard for some people to commit to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can a person figure out the best intermittent fasting schedule for them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying out intermittent fasting — and more specifically the 4:3 pattern — Richard advised readers to take into consideration several factors that could influence their success and sustainability, such as: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prescription medications (&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323760" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, high blood pressure medication, etc.) that could be impacted by drastically altering nutrient and energy intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mood/emotional and psychological well-being — are you the type of person who gets “hangry” or develops a headache after not eating for 6 to 8 hours?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;social wellbeing — will this pattern impede my ability to join friends and family for dinner parties, celebrations, or brunch? This can lead to isolation, resentment, disordered eating patterns, thoughts or possible &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173184" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;binge-eating&lt;/a&gt; or related behavior. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Richard said to take it one step at a time with these simple tips: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;have a support group or small group to try intermittent fasting together&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;start slow — observe if fasting for 24 hours is doable, followed by 24 hours of eating 80% of recommended calories for a day, alternate for a week, then build up to 48 hours fasting, and so on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;keep in mind that nonfasting days are not “a-cheat-day-free-for-all” or “get out of healthy eating pass.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also practice the 4:3 method by fasting or restricting calorie intake to 20% of your &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263028" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;daily calorie needs&lt;/a&gt; for 24 hours on three nonconsecutive days per week, as was done in the study. Breaking up fasting days may make this regimen easier to stick to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have long observed that in most instances, a slow, steady, informed, and intentional approach is often most advantageous,” Richard said. “Dietary patterns and activity along with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mindfulness-for-mental-wellbeing" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, neuroplasticity activities, and spiritual and social wellbeing for a well-balanced [life] seem to follow that logic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meeting with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) will allow clear information related to nutrient needs and the safety, applicability, and best practices in how implementing a pattern such as this can apply to an individual,” she added. “There are also unique genetic pathways and factors that may inhibit or support the success and desired outcomes using intermittent fasting, which an RDN can help an individual navigate and understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:41:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNQVAwM3NweF93SmZUU2YzMkp3bzkzX0ZKdTFXMGplTnA3NnhiTUNGZVh5WjRFbGdOUHQyUGxBajVuVVhmaFJKNEhXU3V6WGQ0bEJVNS1TbW5iLTd1Z1JfREpOVGRFaEV0UzVLU0RvbjNrX25jYW9oZWdHQ3VtRmFub2Fpand2UDVPQzZSVEduT1JuNGtnTEhhV3JwVjVQUUNJWHZFbUt2VnZEczBZVXNN</guid></item><item><title>Pet owners urged to avoid bait packets: USDA airdropping rabies vaccine - WATE 6 On Your Side</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

However, the study included only healthy adults and excluded people with serious conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors recommended that anyone considering this type of fasting talk to their doctor and a registered dietician.

"If that's something that they think they can do, I'm all for it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you don't want to count calories, track and log your food intake," intermittent fasting "may be beneficial for some people," she said. Still, she stressed that people should choose diets they can stick with long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study did not track participants beyond one year to see if weight loss was maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There's no superior dietary approach," Rothberg said.

If your core is weak, your back and other muscles have to do extra work, which can lead to pain or injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not just athletes who need a strong core. Everyday activities like bending down to tie your shoes or picking up groceries become way easier when your core is in check.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the coach, people in their 20s should be able to do 40 to 50 crunches  as your core is 'at its prime'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/how-many-crunches-you-should-be-able-to-do-at-every-age/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;: 'Think of it as a warmup for all the adventures your abs will support, like dancing all night or carrying groceries in one trip.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then states that those in their in their 30s should manage&lt;span&gt; to do 30 to 40 crunches - noting that 'this is the decade to focus on maintaining strength while juggling work, family and Netflix binges'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long-time trainer added that those in their 40s should be able to 20 to 30 crunches as 'your metabolism might slow'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David also stated that 'consistency is key' and it is important to make sure you are getting some form of exercise in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Yorker further recommend that people in their 50s should be able to push through 15 to 25 crunches to 'stay active and strong'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, people who are aged 60 and above should be able to do 10 to 20 crunches comfortably. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While David admits that the total number of crunches you are able to do varies from person to person, he also warns that being unable to perform the minimum for your age group could be a red flag for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'In some cases, difficulty performing crunches could point to underlying issues like back problems, joint pain or even cardiovascular fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It also likely means that your body is craving more and it is your job to give it what it needs and deserves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding it difficult to perform exercises while accompanied with chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations, may indicate a potential heart health problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the long run, less active people reportedly have a 30 to 50 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Strengthening the core muscles through crunches can also help stabilize the spine and reduce the risk of lower back pain and injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical inactivity is also one of the key reasons along with cigarette smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol that can pave the way for cardiovascular diseases, the New York Department of Health states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, only about one in five adults and teens get enough exercise to maintain good health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency recommends adults to engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for about 150 minutes per week, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOcW5HRTlRbDFSamZtWElXbWtBMFBsX1ZkcXlWUzRUall0MU9rYzJ3cnR2YThIT2daSzhIUk82UTFEblBFNW5KTTA2TG9yeExxWElFRUxHRklvVl9xUjRqZDNYV0dEckh0ZVlaOXY2dFBwOHZSME15VV9Gb3lEU01mU1Eya2NsMTYtcFc5Y3VnTEN2RGZhaXlsa1Z6VUNSOWsz0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5WZkREa0hBTVVLS05KdjI2YTBuRnY3TjVIX1g1MzhNaXp0THVSZW9rbG9UUExIckdRaVpOaS1lemh0MEJCNWttVG1QYU53U3hDR3pra3l3NHlxSkVNTUhHU1AxVVN0UU1Ra0VWMkoyRTdockVFVHFoZDYwd3k3Wjk5NURZNkNzT0tWYmlDbm5UWVp2elZNeWRObTl6WHlQTHVOMUFlbUE</guid></item><item><title>We can, must, and will simulate nematode brains - Hacker News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5FUTZFbEhvX0ZScVdobDZtaVNySVF2NGZQYzFZOHloMzhQNFN2QWZ6cTFjSzJTRjVXLTJfcl8za1FjTUVGMTdkUVNXbUFYSnU5TXl5cGVQTG0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:56:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5FUTZFbEhvX0ZScVdobDZtaVNySVF2NGZQYzFZOHloMzhQNFN2QWZ6cTFjSzJTRjVXLTJfcl8za1FjTUVGMTdkUVNXbUFYSnU5TXl5cGVQTG0</guid></item><item><title>Low Testosterone?

It's essential for sex drive, muscle growth and strength, and bone density. However, it's important for more than that, according to Madison Reeder, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://modifyhealth.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;ModifyHealth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"It plays a far more expansive role by supporting cellular signaling, protein synthesis, fat distribution, and cognitive and emotional regulation," Reeder said. The processes supported by testosterone influence everything from muscle maintenance to red blood cell production to energy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/testosterone-imbalance-signs/" target="_self"&gt;all need testosterone&lt;/a&gt; at some level to feel our best, though it's central to men's health. Low testosterone (also called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;hypogonadism&lt;/a&gt;) occurs when the testicles aren't producing enough testosterone. It's more common than you might think. It's estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;35% of men over 45&lt;/a&gt; years of age have hypogonadism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle changes like moderating alcohol and quitting smoking are necessary for maintaining testosterone levels, another important factor is what you eat. Packing your diet with certain foods may help boost your testosterone levels to a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do testosterone levels vary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone naturally fluctuates. According to Dr. Justin Houman, an assistant professor of urology at &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/home.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, testosterone levels are generally at their highest point in the morning and decline throughout the day, in line with the body's circadian rhythm. Testosterone also changes throughout life. It sharply increases during puberty and gradually decreases after age 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond that, fluctuations can be influenced by a wide range of factors: &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/get-better-sleep-for-sleep-awareness-month-with-these-6-simple-tips/" target="_self"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/carefree-era-tactics-relieve-stress/" target="_self"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt; (particularly &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/blood-stress-test-cortisol-effects-our-bodies/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;), body fat percentage, alcohol consumption, certain medications and even acute or chronic illness," said Houman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pituitary gland is central to regulating testosterone production in the body, and it's a sensitive system that can easily be thrown off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that can &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15603-low-testosterone-male-hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact testosterone levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; include but are not limited to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Urological Association, low testosterone is a &lt;a href="https://www.auanet.org/guidelines-and-quality/guidelines/testosterone-deficiency-guideline" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;level below 300 ng/dL&lt;/a&gt;. A healthy range is considered between 450 and 600ng/dL. "However, there is no "one-size-fits-all" testosterone level. The body's ideal level is influenced by age, sex, genetics, health history, and even how well you sleep or manage stress," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with low testosterone, one of the first places you can look is your diet. Unhealthy diets or chronic under-fueling can impair hormone production while working toward a balanced diet full of nutrients can help stabilize your levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9 foods that may increase testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There isn't a single 'testosterone superfood,' but certain foods support the body's natural testosterone production by providing key nutrients or reducing inflammation and oxidative stress," Houman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritional content of certain foods can give you a leg up when it comes to testosterone, especially if you're deficient in that particular nutrient. Reeder pointed to zinc, vitamin D, magnesium, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/keep-your-heart-healthy-with-omega-3s-heres-how-to-add-them-to-your-diet/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and high-quality protein as pivotal nutrients for healthy testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding the foods on this list to your diet won't magically fix low testosterone levels. However, being intentional about making good food choices can help supplement level management as you speak to your doctor. Your needs will vary depending on your age, health conditions and hormonal status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Milan_Jovic/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach, kale and collard greens contain a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/different-types-of-magnesium/" target="_self"&gt;lot of magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which can help regulate &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/testosterone-levels-test/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;total and free testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. Research &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7830687/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;points to magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; as another nutrient that plays a role in low testosterone. Magnesium reduces &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5551541/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, or the body's imbalance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/antioxidant-rich-foods-and-why-you-need-more-antioxidants/" target="_self"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; and free radicals. Reducing oxidative stress benefits testosterone bioactivity because inflammation and oxidative stress can lower testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating leafy greens may help boost testosterone levels. However, if you're not a big green eater, beans, nuts and dark chocolate are also excellent sources of magnesium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish have a lot going for them in the testosterone department. They are great sources of "good fats" known as omega-3s, which are known to support heart and joint health. Research has revealed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33741447/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low-fat diets can be associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower testosterone levels. While we need more research to fully understand why this is, adding healthy fats to your diet, like fatty fish, can benefit your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not the only benefit of fatty fish. They have a high nutritional content of essential vitamins like zinc and vitamin D, which are crucial for healthy testosterone levels. Those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518189/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;less vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; tend to have lower testosterone levels than those with more vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take a fish oil supplement if you're not a fish eater. A 2020 study found that &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952327820301629" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;fish oil supplements with omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; boost testosterone in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cruciferous vegetables &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houman explained that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts can indirectly support healthier testosterone balance by lowering estrogen levels. They can do this because cruciferous vegetables have a compound called &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;indole-3-carbinol&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies suggest that indole-3-carbinol may slow cancer cell growth, though the research is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;DragonImages/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs can help maintain healthy testosterone levels because they contain vitamin D and healthy fats. They also contain the antioxidant selenium. Animal studies have found that selenium can increase &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257863/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257863/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22testosterone%20production%22}" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;testosterone production&lt;/a&gt;. However, it's important to remember that we don't have human studies to draw any conclusions about the extent of the relationship between selenium and testosterone. Regardless, eggs are highly nutritious and contain other testosterone-friendly nutrients. One smaller study found that eating the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/02000/whole_egg_vs__egg_white_ingestion_during_12_weeks.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;whole egg will be better&lt;/a&gt; for testosterone levels than egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avocados&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are a triple threat when it comes to boosting testosterone levels. They are a great source of healthy fats and magnesium and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Boron-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;contain boron&lt;/a&gt;, a trace element linked to testosterone production. One study found that within a week of taking boron supplements, testosterone levels in males &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4712861/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased up to 32%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oysters and other shellfish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Houman, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-zinc-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;zinc is an essential nutrient&lt;/a&gt; for testosterone synthesis in the testes. Oysters offer the most zinc per serving than any food. Other shellfish, like shrimp, clams, mussels, crab and lobster, have notable zinc levels. If seafood isn't your thing, red meat, pumpkin seeds and lentils are other zinc-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the benefits of zinc, oysters and other shellfish's antioxidant effect may boost testosterone by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556007/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increasing the efficiency of the Leydig cells&lt;/a&gt;, the primary source of testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-food-sources-of-zinc/" target="_self"&gt;15 Best Food Sources of Zinc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Select fruits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruits with flavonoid antioxidants, like pomegranates, berries and cherries, can help support testosterone production. A study of active young men found that drinking two cups of pure pomegranate juice each day for three weeks helped with muscle recovery, reduced inflammation and saw an &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.ajme.2017.03.005" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increase in testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil has several health benefits, like increasing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/naturally-boost-your-heart-health-with-these-5-foods/" target="_self"&gt;good cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and lowering &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/cholesterol-everything-you-should-know/" target="_self"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. There is also some evidence that it may increase testosterone. One small study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research of 60 young males discovered that a daily intake of around five teaspoons of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/02000/whole_egg_vs__egg_white_ingestion_during_12_weeks.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;extra virgin olive oil increased testosterone by 17%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reeder explained that gut health is gaining more attention for its role in hormone regulation. Fermented foods like yogurt and kimchi can indirectly support testosterone levels by ensuring your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5433529/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; is healthy. A healthy gut plays a role in inflammation and hormone metabolism, so eating &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/probiotic-foods-naturally-boost-gut-health/" target="_self"&gt;gut-friendly foods&lt;/a&gt; is always good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While eating these foods won't artificially raise testosterone beyond your body's natural capacity, they can help create the right environment for hormonal stability," Reeder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the best diet for boosting testosterone levels?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any balanced diet that includes testosterone-friendly foods is a good option. However, if you're looking for a specific diet to help you create meals, try the Mediterranean diet. It's rich in lean proteins, healthy fats and plenty of veggies. Houman explained that following a Mediterranean diet has been linked to higher testosterone levels and better reproductive health in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to follow the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/ultimate-guide-mediterranean-diet-2025-healthiest-diet/" target="_self"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; to boost your testosterone levels; you can focus on healthy eating habits to see the benefits. However, it's essential to acknowledge what not to do. Houman explained that ultra-processed foods and high-sugar diets can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11412839/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;suppress testosterone&lt;/a&gt; by promoting insulin resistance.

Fats, especially those from whole food sources, provide cholesterol, a crucial building block for hormone production," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't cut out all fats from your diet or you may see a hormone level drop.

Beyond confirming the presence of the disease, the test also helps determine the stage of its progression. This may fundamentally change how physicians manage Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test was developed by experts at &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; and Lund University in Sweden. Their studies indicate that a particular blood protein, MTBR-tau243, can be used to monitor the extent of dangerous tau accumulation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tangles of tau protein are some of the hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer’s and are directly proportional to the intensity of the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technique is considerably more convenient than brain scans since it is non-invasive, and does not require expensive procedures that are difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-alzheimer-s-with-a-blood-test"&gt;Tracking Alzheimer’s with a blood test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, doctors can use several blood &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-tests-offer-new-hope-in-detecting-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; to help detect Alzheimer’s. Some of the tests that are already in use are based on earlier discoveries at Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests look for early warning signs but don’t reveal how much the disease has progressed. That’s a crucial gap. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medical-breakthrough-new-vaccine-may-prevent-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s treatments&lt;/a&gt; are most helpful in the early stages, before too much damage has been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a way to tell whether someone is in an early or late phase of the disease would help doctors decide which treatment would work best. It could also clarify whether a person’s memory or thinking issues are actually caused by Alzheimer’s or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer’s tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer’s symptoms and dementia,” said co-senior author Dr. Randall J. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In clinical practice right now, we don’t have easy or accessible measures of Alzheimer’s tangles and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and so a tangle blood test like this can provide a much better indication if the symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s and may also help doctors decide which treatments are best for their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-reliable-way-to-monitor-the-disease"&gt;A reliable way to monitor the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s typically starts with a buildup of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleeping-may-lower-levels-of-alzheimers-abnormal-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid protein&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Tau tangles develop later and mark the point when symptoms begin to show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to see these changes has been through PET scans, which can track amyloid and tau deposits. But these scans are expensive, time-consuming, and often only available in large hospitals or research centers. That’s why scientists have been working on blood-based alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team had already developed blood tests that measure amyloid plaque buildup. Earlier research showed that levels of MTBR-tau243 in spinal fluid could match up with brain tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the researchers demonstrated that they could get the same results using blood samples. A blood draw is much easier and more accessible than a spinal tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-the-new-approach"&gt;Testing the new approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the test, the researchers used data from two groups of people. One group came from a research center at Washington University and included 108 volunteers. The other group included 55 people from a Swedish study known as BioFINDER-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the experts checked their findings with data from 739 additional people in the BioFINDER-2 group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants represented a range of Alzheimer’s stages – from people who had no symptoms but had amyloid in their brains, to those with mild cognitive issues, to people with full dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included individuals with memory or thinking problems due to other conditions, and some who were cognitively healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-progression-revealed-in-blood"&gt;Alzheimer’s progression revealed in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were promising. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood matched the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people and those in the earliest stage of the disease, the levels were normal. But in people showing symptoms, the protein levels were clearly elevated – and much higher in those with advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difference made it easy to tell who was in an early or late stage of Alzheimer’s. It also helped distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from other kinds of cognitive problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of clarity could make a huge difference in choosing the right treatment path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test uses technology licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics, which previously developed similar blood tests for amyloid plaques. The earlier tests were designed to detect another tau protein called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe we will use blood-based p-tau217 to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, but MTBR-tau243 will be a highly valuable complement in both clinical settings and research trials,” said Oskar Hansson, a professor of neurology at Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When both of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-earliest-biomarker-protein-psd-95-identified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are positive, the likelihood that Alzheimer’s is the underlying cause of a person’s cognitive symptoms increases significantly, compared to when only p-tau217 is abnormal. This distinction is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-to-better-treatments"&gt;Looking ahead to better treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are two FDA-approved drugs that target amyloid in the brain to slow Alzheimer’s. But more treatments are being tested – including ones that aim at tau protein and other disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these therapies become available, doctors will need reliable ways to match the right treatment to each stage of the disease. Blood tests could be the key to this shift toward personalized Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re about to enter the era of personalized medicine for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Kanta Horie, a research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For early stages with low tau tangles, anti-amyloid therapies could be more efficacious than in late stages. But after the onset of dementia with high tau tangles, anti-tau therapy or one of the many other experimental approaches may be more effective.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have a clinically available blood test for staging, plus treatments that work at different stages of the disease, doctors will be able to optimize their treatment plans for the specific needs of each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

A fan favourite Starbucks drink made the cut!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Levine, drinking booze is “likely safe if you have one or less drinks a day if you have no heart problems, but alcohol intake increases blood pressure, triglycerides, atrial fibrillation and — in higher doses — is a direct toxin to the heart, so much so we have a phrase in cardiology — alcohol cardiomyopathy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption, even in small amounts, can negatively impact heart health and increase the risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a more detailed explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How Alcohol Affects the Heart:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies show that even moderate alcohol consumption can elevate the risk of cardiovascular diseases like coronary disease, stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and aneurysm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High Blood Pressure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excessive alcohol intake can lead to high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cardiomyopathy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavy drinking can contribute to cardiomyopathy, a condition that affects the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Irregular Heart Rhythms (Arrhythmias):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Binge drinking or excessive alcohol consumption can disrupt the heart's rhythm, leading to arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of stroke and heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Damage to Heart Muscle:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long-term heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle, making it weaker and less efficient at pumping blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased Heart Rate:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcohol can temporarily increase heart rate, and if it goes over 100 beats per minute, it can cause a condition called tachycardia, which can lead to more serious issues like heart failure or irregular rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Levine, alcohol cardiomyopathy is a heart condition caused specifically by chronic heavy alcohol consumption, and it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Levine concurs with the recent debunking of the common wisdom that a couple of glasses of red wine a day is good for your heart, as he told NY Post, “Simply put: people who drank a glass of wine may have been more athletic or had some other unaccounted benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soda&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Levine, “Let's be simple here: a can of soda has 10 teaspoons of sugar in it or the equivalent amount of corn syrup. It’s toxic!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive consumption of soda, especially sugary sodas, can be detrimental to heart health, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and other related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here's a more detailed explanation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sugar Content and Cardiovascular Risk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sugary drinks, including soda, are high in added sugars and empty calories, which can contribute to weight gain, obesity, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. These conditions, in turn, are major risk factors for heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Studies Linking Soda to Heart Problems:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research suggests that consuming sugary drinks, including soda, is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, even in physically active individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other Health Concerns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond heart health, excessive soda consumption can lead to other health problems, including tooth decay, metabolic disorders, and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Levine, these huge doses of sugar, which mostly come in the form of corn syrup in the US, raise triglycerides, increase your weight, spike your blood sugar levels, and give your diabetes risk an uptick — all of which damage the heart. He said, “I want everyone to imagine drinking 1/5 of a cup of pure corn syrup because that’s what you’re doing every time you drink a can of Coke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Energy drinks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brand of drink might boost your energy for the time being, but does more harm than good in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks can pose risks to heart health due to their high caffeine content and other stimulants, potentially leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and irregular heart rhythms, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here's a more detailed explanation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine and Stimulants: Energy drinks contain high levels of caffeine and other stimulants like guarana and taurine, which can significantly increase heart rate and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart Rhythm Issues:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combination of these ingredients can potentially disrupt the heart's normal rhythm, leading to arrhythmias or palpitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased Risk for Certain Individuals:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; People with pre-existing heart conditions, hypertension, or those with genetic heart conditions may be at a higher risk of experiencing adverse effects from energy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other Health Concerns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides heart-related issues, energy drinks are also high in sugar and calories, which can contribute to weight gain, obesity, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Levine, “Drinks like Red Bull have about 1.5 times the caffeine as coffee but also contain almost eight teaspoons or more of sugar — or worse, corn syrup. The Monster energy drink has almost 15 teaspoons of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Starbucks frappuccino&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last but not the least - the devil for the heart lies in the Starbucks’ frappuccino!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it breaks your heart - let it; because quitting the beloved frappuccino is going to be the best thing you’d do for your heart for the longer run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine told NY Post, “A grande iced frap used to be my favorite. Until I realized I actually got a high off this stuff and then crashed within two hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s got almost 100 mg of caffeine and 51 grams of sugar — the equivalent of 13 teaspoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Levine, “People may not realize but that’s almost as much sugar as the Monster energy drink — 57 grams — but less than the 160 mg of caffeine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine believes “it’s potentially dangerous stress on the heart for anyone with heart disease to drink these concoctions of caffeine and sugar and a perfect storm to induce palpitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He notes that’s especially true for anyone trying to get a little pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist warns, “Adding alcohol for a boost or a hangover cure only makes it worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Evictions hit families during housing shortage in Phoenix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Brain Mapping Tool Reveals How Learning Rewires Synaptic Links - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5TZHJRRXVRY05yTkFuakRWems3Y2dGX2NhdENRUzI4OGpaMTloSjVFUmRtX1BHZzJUb28zYkdkdUlxWWpfLVdZUzZhLW9udW4tWGZGM2gtOERaY0c1YWpPT0Y1NHg3czl6MG5mYk1qN0Fhd3dv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed DELTA, a powerful new imaging method that maps brain-wide synaptic changes during learning.

Experiences cause the strength of these connections to change – a process called synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory. But exactly where in the brain these changes occur during the learning process is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108330"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By enabling researchers to see these brain-wide changes, DELTA gives scientists a starting point for follow up studies to detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind learning and memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janelia researchers have devised a new way to see where these synaptic changes are happening across the entire brain. The work was led by the Spruston and Lavis labs and the lab of former Janelia Senior Group Leader Karel Svoboda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new imaging method, DELTA, provides scientists with a brain-wide map of how individual synaptic proteins change over time. Proteins important for synaptic plasticity are known to be degraded or synthesized as synaptic connections change. So, tracking these synaptic protein changes during learning enables scientists to also understand how synaptic connections change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information allows researchers to home in on areas of the brain that might be important for learning and memory and helps them figure out the molecular mechanisms behind the synaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the problems in figuring out which molecules are in charge of what changes is that it’s very hard to know where those changes are happening. We didn’t have good way of figuring out where in the brain things are changing so we can focus our attention on the most interesting parts,” says Boaz Mohar, a Research Scientist in the Spruston Lab who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we have a different way of looking at our manipulations and how they affect the circuit at the brain-wide level by using imaging to drill down on the subcellular structure. This helps us bridge that gap between behavior and mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method works by first labeling a synaptic protein of interest in the mouse brain with a bright Janelia Fluor (JF) dye. To investigate how synaptic connections change during learning, the researchers used mice that had already been trained to on a simple task: learning to associate two distinct visual cues with a water reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this initial labeling, the mice were split into two groups: one group received water randomly at the two cues, as they had prior to labeling, while the task for the other group was modified such that only one of the cues was associated with the water reward. After a few days, once the researchers saw a clear difference between the two groups’ actions, the same synaptic protein of interest was labeled with a different JF dye in both groups of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over those days, some of the original labeled proteins are degraded and some new proteins are synthesized, incorporating the second dye. By imaging the entire brain, researchers can see where the synaptic proteins have changed in both groups of mice, giving them a hint as to where changes in synaptic connections are happening during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw that learning the modified task caused the synaptic protein they studied, GluA2, to change in specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used the new method to see differences in protein turnover in mice living in a normal environment and mice living in an enriched environment with toys and companions. In this case, putting a mouse in an enriched environment caused widespread changes in GluA2 across the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By enabling researchers to see these brain-wide changes, DELTA gives scientists a starting point for follow up studies to detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a next step, the researchers are working to add additional features to DELTA that will allow them to pinpoint when proteins are changing during the few days the animals are learning a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the lab heads who led the project, Nelson Spruston, says the development of DELTA exemplifies the collaborative spirit of the research campus, with scientists across Janelia lending their knowledge in chemistry, imaging, behavior, and genetics to the project. The team also collaborated with experts outside Janelia, including researchers at Northwestern University who helped to validate the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the team is working with scientists around the world to help them use DELTA to track synaptic changes in their own research, collaborations enabled through Janelia’s Visiting Scientist Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a quintessential Janelia project,” Spruston says. “It involved doing something that nobody has ever done before and required collaboration with lots of people who contributed expertise to make this all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain mapping and synaptic plasticity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#70121f1d0015091e3018181d195e1f0217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey – HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01923-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Boaz Mohar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity alters neuronal connections in response to experience, which is thought to underlie learning and memory. However, the loci of learning-related synaptic plasticity, and the degree to which plasticity is localized or distributed, remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a new method, DELTA, for mapping brain-wide changes in synaptic protein turnover with single-synapse resolution, based on Janelia Fluor dyes and HaloTag knock-in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During associative learning, the turnover of the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluA2, an indicator of synaptic plasticity, was enhanced in several brain regions, most markedly hippocampal area CA1. More broadly distributed increases in the turnover of synaptic proteins were observed in response to environmental enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CA1, GluA2 stability was regulated in an input-specific manner, with more turnover in layers containing input from CA3 compared to entorhinal cortex. DELTA will facilitate exploration of the molecular and circuit basis of learning and memory and other forms of plasticity at scales ranging from single synapses to the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:28:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5TZHJRRXVRY05yTkFuakRWems3Y2dGX2NhdENRUzI4OGpaMTloSjVFUmRtX1BHZzJUb28zYkdkdUlxWWpfLVdZUzZhLW9udW4tWGZGM2gtOERaY0c1YWpPT0Y1NHg3czl6MG5mYk1qN0Fhd3dv</guid></item><item><title>Stress has a sweet spot. 5 tips to help you find it - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQNjlzVGQ0Tlc0QjJpejRvU2xzZy01b05yeWYtYWFSWHFfd1VORGk4SWt3T1VlTDM3dEZRN0ZLR0xad08xNDZOY1FkMG01eTJaSjU3OFNLeGhvcG16OWZoS0ZmNWdraE5ValYzQ3EzNTJvaEN4TFRITDE0UktTeGV6aTZPSTB4MmPSAX5BVV95cUxONXJzcUJrQm9fS2pBaUJCVnRiYy0yalgwMFlQS2xqNlhrUlFqUDFDYjV2bUxBaTVXZVFBLTV2UUp0SXFnbTdyNC1pbTV6bHFheUxVUThWWHZyeXY2U3JGY214WjJ2M21tM1pEbzlCYWVuWGlnVkRmWjlVczMtSWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;“Stress is bad for your health” is one message we consistently hear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfe663000l3b6m64w2j5fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s true: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;stress can be detrimental&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to a whole host of ills, especially when it becomes chronic, unrelenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfdxar000j3b6m7c2315qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But, it turns out, certain types of stress can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/health/keep-cool-under-pressure-wellness/index.html"&gt;lead to growth opportunities&lt;/a&gt; and, according to one doctor and author of the new book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stress-Paradox-Essential-Management-Mind-Body-Soul-ebook/dp/B0CW13NLBZ" target="_blank"&gt;“The Stress Paradox: Why You Need Stress to Live Longer, Healthier, and Happier,”&lt;/a&gt; the right amount of it may actually be crucial to our wellbeing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Yes, too much stress harms us, but not enough is actually just as harmful,” Dr. Sharon Bergquist told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000r3b6m0vkq5mbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist, an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the founder and director of &lt;a href="https://www.emoryhealthcare.org/centers-programs/lifestyle-medicine-wellness" target="_blank"&gt;Emory Lifestyle Medicine &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;knows a thing or two about stress. As a child, she lived through the Iranian Revolution and ultimately her family was forced to flee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000s3b6mfpjvocf3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were the last plane to leave before (Iranian leader Ruhollah) Khomeini came,” she recalled. “The airport was incredibly packed. I remember the whole process of trying to get through security and just the mass of people that were there and how we got onto the runway — every step of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000t3b6m2hjq6t5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her family fled to England, and eventually they settled in the United States. But life wasn’t exactly stress-free in the West either. “In eighth grade I could not write a paragraph in English without a lot of struggle. It would take me all night,” she said. Yet she managed to prosper, graduate as her high school’s valedictorian, attend Yale University as an undergraduate and then Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000u3b6mgugrmm7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist’s childhood experiences planted the seeds for her interest in stress. “Ultimately it triggered this obsession for me of, why is it that some people grow and thrive from these experiences? And others don’t?” she said. She said she became really interested in the question of whether all stress is harmful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm8xfwjsg000w3b6m7reygeve@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfw6ro000o3b6mzh8bpm5w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Bergquist’s research, it turns out that it depends on the type and amount of stress a person’s exposed to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00113b6mnaioufys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a lot of professionals (who) are very driven, but are also so passionate about what they do,” she said, noting that they lead what can be considered “stressful” lives. She counts herself among them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00123b6m5mfhqda5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call that good stress, which I think has a very different effect on our bodies than the harmful stress that has become almost synonymous with what people describe as ‘stress’” she said. “I think I can now say with a comfortable level, that (the good) type of stress releases a biochemical profile that is actually health promoting: we release, for example, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00133b6myjrvtmlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dopamine is from the reward for doing something meaningful, she explained. The serotonin is from the joy that comes from accomplishment and the oxytocin is from contributing to the greater good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00143b6mw7w9aazv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said “bad” stress is unpredictable, unavoidable, and not brief or intermittent but rather chronic. Our biochemical response to that type of stress is to release cortisol which eventually leads to the harmful downstream effects on our bodies, such as high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00153b6ma9m5jns1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That trifecta of chemicals released when we take on good stress “mitigates our cortisol level. It literally builds our resilience to stress,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00163b6m8zxfswra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Resilience is like a muscle: It is dynamic and needs to be challenged to get stronger.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00173b6m06wecz7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key, really, is that our stress responses are there to help us. They’re there to help us adapt to our world,” she said, noting that for the entirety of human history that is how humans have survived and thrived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00183b6m696j75er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But the things that help us activate those stress responses have been removed from the fabric of our lives,” she said. No longer do we have to face environmental stressors such as food scarcity and exposure to extremes of heat and cold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00193b6mx4ihwmte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The introduction of a lot of these comforts has removed our connection with the natural environment that we live in,” she said. Consequently “we are essentially handicapping ourselves because we are not allowing our bodies to do what they are so capable of doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001a3b6m1thhggzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to introduce good stress into your life? Bergquist has five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001b3b6m5zw85epl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Challenge yourself to go outside your comfort zone without feeling overwhelmed,” said Bergquist via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001c3b6ma6d3g7r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is medicine. And like any medicine, the dose determines the response,” she explained. “Growth from stress happens when stress is in a hormetic, or Goldilocks, zone — a just right amount that’s not too much or too little.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001d3b6mwyalwifz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, push yourself to get in the water and swim, but don’t let yourself drown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001e3b6m5kx3q32t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Are you challenging yourself in ways that align with your beliefs? Or conflict with them?” Bergquist asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001f3b6mqb86l8au@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Your heart and mind know the difference,” she said. “Persevering in situations where you feel stuck or disconnected from your values can become a harmful form of stress.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001g3b6m0vt1v1yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is not about simply positively reframing the stress in our lives,” she said. “But instead, deliberately taking action with meaningful and purpose-driven challenges as an antidote to the chronic stressors that we can’t control or avoid.”

            For example, she said, it could involve accepting or creating a job opportunity that aligns with your values or learning a skill that you find rewarding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “To grow from stress, you have to make time for rest and recovery,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Under stress, your body switches into a mode where you conserve energy and do internal housekeeping,” she said. “When you recover, your brain and body remodel and build new connections that better prepare you for future challenges.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Recovery, Bergquist said, is just as important as good stress to gain benefits. “Even good stress can build up to becoming harmful without recovery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Physically stressing yourself can help build mental resilience and vice versa,” Bergquist said. “It’s a remarkable process called cross-adaptation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001m3b6m33y2nz1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you experience good physical or psychological stress, you repair and regenerate your cells, which makes every part of your body healthier and stronger,” she explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001n3b6mtyrfsv39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can build mental resilience, for example, by physically stressing yourself (in a good way) by doing things like “eating plant-based foods with stress resistance-building phytochemicals, exercising vigorously, briefly exposing yourself to heat and cold, and fasting intermittently through time-restricted eating,” she said. “We have many tools for managing stress and lessening its harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Experiencing stress is not a glitch— it’s a feature. “Our human history is one of overcoming stress — and becoming stronger because of it,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001p3b6mobup51i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Through repeat cycles of stress and recovery, we summon our natural capability. It’s a gift we have inherited in our DNA,” she said. “Resilience is a muscle we can all build no matter where we are or what we are facing. It’s okay to have fears. And it’s okay to want to avoid challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Trust and do it anyway. The result can be life-changing,” she said.

People with a history of abuse or neglect were more likely to feel distress during everyday setbacks and less likely to experience joy from good moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, even positive events triggered negative emotions, highlighting a long-lasting emotional imprint. These findings suggest that childhood adversity subtly shapes emotional life in adulthood, even for those without clinical mental health diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blunted Joy Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with childhood adversity feel less happiness from positive events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Oversensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; They react more intensely to daily stress and problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Childhood trauma affects emotional experiences well into later adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Heriot Watt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad experiences in childhood can have long-lasting effects, making people more sensitive to their daily ups and downs as adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Heriot-Watt University shows that adverse childhood experiences not only cause people to respond more negatively to bad events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also affects how they respond to good events in daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108326"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a child and adult." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;People who faced physical and emotional abuse as children had stronger emotional reactions to daily problems. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, a journal published by the American Psychological Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative reactions to lows and highs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sophie Potter from Heriot-Watt University’s School of Social Sciences, with colleagues from the University of Leicester and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, investigated how childhood adversity affects people’s reactions to everyday experiences, good and bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They studied nearly 2000 adults aged 35 to 86. For eight days, participants wrote about their experiences and emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Potter said: “Most research has focused on how people with difficult childhoods react more strongly to bad events, like stress or problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there’s not much on how childhood adversity affects people’s ability to feel joy or happiness at positive events, like having a laugh with friends or receiving positive feedback at work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who faced physical and emotional abuse as children had stronger emotional reactions to daily problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only do they have a more negative reaction to bad events, but they are also less likely to feel happy about good things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, good events appear to trigger negative reactions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ‘subtle effect’ on daily life &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potter points out that around 30% of adults in Western countries have experienced adversity in their childhoods, but our knowledge of its impact focuses on a small group of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of research has been conducted with people who have gone on to experience clinical levels of depression or anxiety, for example, instead of the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There will be thousands of people in the UK and across other western nations who aren’t suffering from a major clinical disorder, but childhood adversity may still be having a subtle effect on their daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding that childhood adversity could be affecting how you experience good and bad events could help people self-regulate and adapt.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research used the MIDUS dataset, and Potter says she would like to expand the research with a bigger group of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be interesting to use data from more diverse groups, whether it’s race and ethnicity or age. I’d be very interested to find out if there’s an age at which childhood adversity loses its effects on people’s behaviour, if there’s a resilience or self-knowledge that kicks in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this child adversity and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9cf97d4d8cacddccbcad6d7f9d1ce97d8da97ccd2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Victoria Masterson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hw.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heriot Watt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Victoria Masterson – Heriot Watt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0001512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emotional reactivity to daily positive and negative events in adulthood: The role of adverse childhood experiences&lt;/a&gt;” by Sophie Potter et al. &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional reactivity to daily positive and negative events in adulthood: The role of adverse childhood experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have lasting impact on everyday emotional experiences in adulthood, with extant evidence linking ACEs to elevated emotional reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, findings are typically based on reactivity to &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; daily events (i.e., stressors) and its moderation by &lt;em&gt;cumulative&lt;/em&gt; ACEs (where individual adversities are summed into a total score), which overlooks adversity-specific associations and reactivity to other types of daily events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore examine cumulative and individual ACEs as moderators of emotional reactivity to positive and negative daily events. Data were drawn from the National Study of Daily Experiences 2 (NSDE-II), collected 2004–2009, whereupon middle-aged and older adults (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,994; &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 58.61; range = 35–86; 57% female) reported daily events and affect on eight consecutive evenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multilevel models were used to estimate the moderating role of ACEs for within-person associations between positive/negative events and affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that cumulative ACEs and a number of individual adversities (specifically those characterized by abuse but not by neglect or household challenge/dysfunction) were associated with emotional reactivity to positive &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; negative daily events. That is, cumulative and abuse-based ACEs were associated with increased negative affect and/or decreased positive affect on days with a negative event &lt;em&gt;and on days with a positive event&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings add to literature on the long-lasting and pervasive influence of early life experiences on everyday emotional experiences in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss differences in reactivity to positive versus negative daily events and in cumulative versus adversity-specific associations as well as their theoretical and methodological implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:59:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9LRi1PT3pjaW9ZV2xVNGF0NVhxM09NUTdGV3ctLTNZeGxheFRWMHZfNnF1Y0tKbi1XUFI0U19rcnZ6MFdrOU9ya0NNM1BHa0lDcUpvWlp6ODNUczMwMFZCU0RKR25TQVdYcTUwa3lfTWNaWW1ITkE</guid></item><item><title>Brain Circuit for Vicarious Fear Reveals How We Feel Others’ Pain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1qTmMyMTJCbU1BMy0tTlJ1TWlHb2lDbmhva1ZsTU4yNkF3a0dKd0o5OXM1OHp5UE1fUlRqTnl3bnF3TjMwYkppSFUzTDVZMXZjT2FPdWJiQkFHMUZHQi12aGVQNC0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have uncovered a dedicated brain circuit that distinguishes between direct fear and fear learned by observing others—known as vicarious fear. The study shows that the right side of the brainstem’s locus coeruleus (LC) activates a specific pathway to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during vicarious fear, while the left side processes direct fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disabling the right LC-ACC pathway in mice erased their vicarious fear response, revealing the brain’s lateralized design for emotional processing. These findings offer new insights into empathy, social learning, and potential treatments for disorders like psychopathy, social anxiety, and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateralized Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; The right brainstem (LC) regulates vicarious fear, while the left handles direct fear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vicarious Fear Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; A specialized LC→ACC circuit activates only during observed distress in others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may inform treatments for empathy-related psychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever felt a chill run down your spine while watching someone else in distress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as vicarious fear, allows us to experience fear by observing others—even when we are not in direct danger ourselves. This aligns with the concept of ‘putting oneself in another’s shoes’—both figuratively and, as research suggests, even neurologically. Just as we metaphorically step into another’s place to understand their emotions, our brain processes fear vicariously when we witness someone else’s distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108322"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While essential for social learning and survival, the neural mechanisms distinguishing direct fear (from personal threats) and vicarious fear (from others’ distress) have remained a mystery—until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. SHIN Hee-sup at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) has uncovered a fundamental brain circuit that distinguishes these two types of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings reveal that the locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem structure that produces norepinephrine (NA), plays a crucial role in processing fear—but in a lateralized manner, with the right and left hemispheres serving distinct functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have studied how the brain processes fear, focusing primarily on regions like the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The locus coeruleus (LC) has also been recognized as a key player in stress and fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until now, it was unknown whether the LC treats direct and vicarious fear as one and the same—or whether the brain has evolved distinct pathways for these different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced neuroscience techniques such as optogenetics (light-based neural control), fiber photometry (real-time neural activity measurement), and viral tracing (mapping brain connections), the researchers pinpointed a specialized neural circuit that selectively processes vicarious fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hypothesized that the right-hemisphere LC connects to the ACC to regulate fear learned from others, while a separate pathway governs direct fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the team selectively inhibited neural pathways in mice and observed their behavioral responses. When a mouse saw another mouse receiving a mild foot shock—a model of vicarious fear—its right LC-ACC circuit became highly active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when this pathway was silenced using optogenetics, the observing mouse no longer exhibited freezing behavior, a hallmark of fear. In contrast, deactivating the left-side LC had no effect on any of the fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments confirmed that this circuit relies on β-adrenergic receptors in the right ACC, as administering a beta-blocker (propranolol) also suppressed the vicarious fear response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also traced the inputs to the LC, identifying two key upstream regions: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA). Notably, the BNST→LC→ACC pathway was active only during vicarious fear, whereas the CeA→LC→BLA (basolateral amygdala) pathway was involved in both direct and vicarious fear, revealing a functional split in LC processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to demonstrate that the LC-NA system is functionally lateralized—meaning the brainstem itself has distinct right- and left-side roles in emotional processing. It also sheds light on how the brain differentiates between “your fear” and “mine,” providing insights into the neural basis of empathy and social learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have significant implications for understanding and treating fear-related psychiatric conditions. Disorders such as psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, social anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve disruptions in fear regulation and social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying a dedicated neural circuit for vicarious fear, this research lays the groundwork for targeted therapies aimed at restoring normal fear processing in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also contributes to a broader understanding of brain asymmetry—the idea that different sides of the brain handle different functions. While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team plans to investigate whether similar pathways exist in the human brain. If so, this could bridge the gap between animal studies and clinical applications, potentially leading to new strategies for treating disorders related to fear and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing how our brains distinguish between direct and observed fear, this study sheds new light on the biological basis of empathy and emotional learning. It offers exciting possibilities for developing treatments for psychiatric conditions and deepens our understanding of how emotions are wired into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a1d03060603191f022a03081944180f440118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;William Suh – Institute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57701-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/a&gt;” by SHIN Hee-sup et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear can be induced either directly through self-experience of aversive events or vicariously by observing conspecifics experiencing such events. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NA) system is crucial in fear responses and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether the LC-NA system differentially processes these two types of fear, direct and vicarious in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results highlighted that the right hemisphere LC→anterior cingulate cortex pathway is uniquely crucial for vicarious fear, while the two inputs to the LC—from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA)—differentially contribute to fear processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNST plays a more targeted role in vicarious fear, and the CeA has a broader influence on fear in general. This underscores the complexity and specialization within the LC-NA system for fear-processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:35:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1qTmMyMTJCbU1BMy0tTlJ1TWlHb2lDbmhva1ZsTU4yNkF3a0dKd0o5OXM1OHp5UE1fUlRqTnl3bnF3TjMwYkppSFUzTDVZMXZjT2FPdWJiQkFHMUZHQi12aGVQNC0</guid></item><item><title>Vitamin D Could Be an Effective Way to Slow Progress of MS - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOQkhTbTRkbVNnV1dUWE1PaWFhaEEzdXJ6ck1rN3ZZZWg0V3NKOE95cHF5OFdlTVM3VWdqbG04Zy1pZ1FSWFROdlpXZmR0S21YcDlwLVBWMWZod2J1ejFaa0dnNUw3ajl1amUzdlFBdkxadGZUZVlZMFViMldhNm16Y2g0QUJndmxSRnJKSzc4S2E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers from institutions across France have uncovered solid clinical evidence that supplements of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; could be an effective treatment for the neurodegenerative condition &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found in a small number of foods such as fatty fish, eggs, and to some degree mushrooms,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D is typically converted from other compounds in our body on exposure to sunlight. However we get it, the chemical plays an important role in absorbing calcium from the gut, as well as immune functions, cell growth, metabolism, and neuromuscular activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.796933/full"&gt;has previously been identified&lt;/a&gt; as a risk factor for MS, a condition in which the body attacks the protective sheaths surrounding its own nerve cells. So researchers conducted a trial with 303 participants diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/cis-and-ms-whats-the-difference"&gt;clinically isolated syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (CIS); a condition that is in some ways similar to, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102262"&gt;often develops&lt;/a&gt; into, MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving just over half of the volunteers a hefty fortnightly dose of vitamin D supplements (cholecalciferol) and the other half a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; over the course of two years, the researchers found those in the vitamin group showed fewer lesions on the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease activity was observed in 60.3 percent of the vitamin D group and 74.1 percent of the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156205" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart.jpg" alt="Disease chart" class="wp-image-156205 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156205" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Vitamin D reduced disease activity in patients. (Thouvenot et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; showed that high-dose cholecalciferol monotherapy initiated within 90 days after diagnosis of CIS strongly suggestive of MS reduced disease activity significantly compared with placebo," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were considered  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; enough to confirm vitamin D could help prevent at least some of the damage done by CIS and MS as the immune system attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to characterize the participants who saw the most improvement: those with a severe vitamin D deficiency (as you might expect), those with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"&gt;normal BMI&lt;/a&gt;, and those without any spinal lesions at the start of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Altogether, this suggests that cholecalciferol could represent an inexpensive therapeutic alternative, with low risk of adverse events, after a CIS, especially in populations with limited access to disease-modifying therapies," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a promising step forward for vitamin D as a potential MS treatment, though unanswered questions remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions were largely based on measures of the damage done to the central nervous system, as detected by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; scans. In terms of symptoms corresponding with MS, there was a much smaller gap between the groups. What's more, the difference in relapse rates between the two groups was found to be non-significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also keen to run further tests on how effective this level of vitamin D dosage can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work also needs to be done in terms of understanding the mechanisms involved here and the potential risks: we know that vitamin D can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-can-trigger-autoimmune-conditions-heres-why"&gt;boost the immune system&lt;/a&gt; in certain ways, and that MS is caused by a misfiring immune system, but future studies will be needed to figure out exactly what the relationship is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts continue to find ways to cure or reverse MS, and progress is being made – in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-a-single-genetic-variant-that-makes-ms-more-severe"&gt;identifying risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-trial-gives-new-hope-for-treating-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;limiting the damage&lt;/a&gt; it does to the body, and understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-gives-more-evidence-multiple-sclerosis-might-start-with-an-earlier-infection"&gt;how it gets started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as an add-on therapy," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beans are a versatile and nutritious food&lt;/a&gt; that can play a key role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Loved for their simplicity and packed with health benefits, they are an excellent addition to any balanced diet. Here are four ways beans can help keep your blood sugar levels in check. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber for Steady Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a blood sugar-friendly carb, look no further than fiber-rich beans. What makes their fiber so beneficial? “Fiber slows the release of the carbs into your bloodstream, which stabilizes your blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="http://www.sarahgoldrd.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Anzlovar, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in intuitive eating. And beans are an easy way to rack up lots of this blood sugar-leveling nutrient. For instance, 1 cup of canned black beans provides approximately 17 grams of dietary fiber. That’s more than half the Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to fiber, beans boast not one but two kinds, namely soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. But their blood sugar-regulating power comes from their soluble fiber. This fiber forms a gel-like substance in the gut that slows the release of carbs into the bloodstream. That, in turn, prevents sharp spikes or crashes in blood sugar levels, promoting a more stable and gradual energy supply throughout the day. Soluble fiber is so effective that a meta-analysis of 29 studies found that it enhanced multiple measures of blood sugar control and reduced body mass index among individuals with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Protein for Satiety &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans also contain protein, which plays a role in blood sugar management,” says Anzlovar.  One cup of canned beans offers approximately 15 grams of protein, depending on the variety. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes beans’ protein so effective? Protein takes longer to digest and metabolize than carbohydrates. As a result, consuming protein-rich foods like beans can promote satiety and help maintain steady glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is also strong evidence that a higher dietary protein intake, particularly from plant proteins like beans, supports weight loss and improves glycemic control among people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are an excellent choice for blood sugar control due to their low &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glycemic index (GI)&lt;/a&gt;. The glycemic index measures how quickly a particular food raises blood sugar levels. Research has found that eating a diet rich in low-GI foods can improve short-term blood sugar control and reduce weight and body fat in people living with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what makes beans a low-GI powerhouse, you can thank their combination of fiber and protein. Together, these nutrients slow the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose, promoting a slow, sustained energy release.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a rich source of minerals like potassium, copper, manganese and magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While all of these do lots of good things for your body, it’s beans’ magnesium that plays a crucial role in blood sugar control. This mineral is essential for hundreds of biochemical processes in the body, especially blood sugar regulation. It’s so powerful that people who consume more magnesium are less likely to develop diabetes, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just 1 cup of cooked black beans provides roughly 120 milligrams of magnesium. That’s nearly 30% of the Daily Value.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are truly nutritional gems. Thanks to their high fiber, protein and magnesium content and their low glycemic index, they’re our No. 1 underrated carb for better blood sugar control. Whether you’re a fan of chickpeas or black, cannellini or pinto beans, these satisfying pulses aren’t just great for your blood sugar. They’re a delicious addition to any balanced diet. Beyond blood sugar benefits, beans support heart health and metabolism and help keep your digestive system in top shape. Plus, they couldn’t be easier to prepare. Simply dump them into a slow cooker or pressure cooker or pop open a can. Either way, they are as versatile as they are healthy!&lt;br&gt;

						The Hinesburg Police Department has issued a warning about a coyote in the area, after a resident was reportedly attacked on Monday. Police took a report from an individual around 2:30 p.m. on Monday. The individual told police they had been attacked by a coyote on Leavensworth Road that  appeared to have porcupine quills in its mouth. It was not immediately clear if the coyote had rabies. However, Hinesburg police said the game warden had been contacted. The individual who encountered the coyote did not immediately report any injuries to police. Officials said he was seeking medical care as a precaution. The Hinesburg Police Department has asked people not to approach the animal but to call 802-482-3397 if they see it.

NIH trial shows new form of TIL therapy effective against colon, rectum, pancreas, and bile duct tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new form of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, a form of personalized cancer immunotherapy, dramatically improved the treatment’s effectiveness in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers, according to results of a clinical trial led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The findings, published April 1, 2025 in &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03627-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;offer hope that this therapy could be used to treat a variety of solid tumors, which has so far eluded researchers developing cell-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of therapy involves identifying and selecting immune cells (TILs) that are found in the tumor that specifically recognize and attack a patient’s tumor cells. Next, scientists grow those TILs into large quantities in the laboratory before they are finally administered to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients in the clinical trial, who had a variety of gastrointestinal tumors, also received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to help further boost their immune response. The result was nearly 24% of patients treated with selected TILs plus pembrolizumab had a substantial reduction in the size of their tumors, compared with 7.7% of patients who received selected TILs without pembrolizumab. Patients treated with TILs that had not been selected for anti-tumor activity had no tumor shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We're seeing the first extension of cellular therapy with TILs into the common solid cancers,” said Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., the study’s lead investigator at NIH’s National Cancer Institute. “We see a little crack in the solid wall of cancer by using cell-based immunotherapy for the common solid cancers, and we think we have ways to open that crack even further.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial included 91 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers—including esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, colon, and rectal cancers—that had worsened despite a median of four prior treatment regimens. In the pilot phase of the trial, 18 patients were treated with TILs that had not been selected for anti-tumor activity, and there were no objective responses (tumor shrinkage of at least 30% is considered an objective response). In the second phase, 39 patients were treated with selected TIL therapy, and three (7.7%) had objective responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third phase, 34 patients received pembrolizumab immediately before selected TIL therapy to prevent the newly introduced immune cells from becoming inactivated by the patient’s own immune system. This group had the best response, with 8 of 34 (23.5%) patients experiencing an objective response. All 91 patients had also received standard chemotherapy and high-dose interleukin-2 before the TIL therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the trial’s second and third phases, objective responses were seen in multiple types of gastrointestinal cancers, including cancers of the colon, rectum, pancreas, and bile duct. Responses lasted between 8 months and more than 5.8 years in the group that received selected TIL therapy alone, and between 4 months and 3.5 years in the group that received selected TIL therapy and pembrolizumab. Serious side effects occurred in 30% of patients treated with selected TILs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now developing methods to identify TILs that recognize multiple, specific proteins within a tumor, known as neoantigens, to help increase the number of patients who respond to selected TIL therapy with pembrolizumab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TIL therapy, developed in the late 1980s by Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues at NIH, uses an individual’s own TILs to fight their tumor cells. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first TIL therapy for a solid cancer, lifileucel (Amtagvi), for treating advanced melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study was co-led by Dr. Rosenberg and NCI investigators Frank J. Lowery, Ph.D., and Stephanie L. Goff, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;New research says antidepressants taken by millions of Americans are linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the European Heart Rhythm Association’s 2025 Congress, found that individuals who succumbed to an unexpected death caused by a heart-related issue had a substantially higher rate of antidepressant usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at data from all deaths in Denmark of residents aged 18 to 90 during a single year in 2010. Among the group of just over 6,000 people who experienced sudden cardiac death that year, a disproportionately high number took antidepressants. However, one demographic, ages 18 to 29, did not show a statistically significant link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis further broke down those on antidepressant medication into two buckets: individuals who took the medication for one to five years and those who took it for more than five years. Those in the first group were found to have a 56% higher risk of sudden cardiac death compared to those who were not on the medication. However, those in the second group had a 2.2 times (220%) higher risk than their non-medicated peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the study found a higher risk of cardiac death the longer someone was taking antidepressants, said study co-author Dr. Jasmin Mujkanovic of Rigshospitalet Hjertecentret, Copenhagen, Denmark, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those exposed for six years or more were at even more increased risk than those exposed for one to five years, when compared with people unexposed to antidepressants in the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ad post-ad"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="172894" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mujkanovic theorizes that the increase in risk could be driven by multiple factors, like the drugs themselves causing the adverse effects. She also says the exposure time to antidepressants could be an indicator of a more serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, the increase could be influenced by behavioral or lifestyle factors associated with depression, such as delayed healthcare seeking, and poor cardiovascular health,” said Mujkanovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, more than 20 million adults and 3.7 million kids ages 12 to 17 have depression. Across the country, roughly one in eight people manage the condition using antidepressants, Fortune &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/medication-antidepressants-ssri-risk-cardiac-death/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But then I kept getting it,” Gooding told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continuous alerts concerned Gooding and when she discovered a lump on her neck, these warnings pushed her into making an immediate appointment with her doctor. Gooding officially got diagnosed with lymphoma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oura ring’s warning “definitely validated the way that I was feeling and then made me take it more seriously,” Gooding said.

The ring does not diagnose people with specific conditions, but it does share when biometrics are elevated, changing its data into an urgent red font. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s these red warnings that are causing people to make major health decisions, like finally making a doctor’s appointment that they might otherwise put off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;During COVID in 2020, the NBA even &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/nba-players-could-wear-a-smart-ring-to-track-covid-19-symptoms-as-season-resumes-at-disney-world/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="gave" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/nba-players-could-wear-a-smart-ring-to-track-covid-19-symptoms-as-season-resumes-at-disney-world/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; the Oura ring to players and league staff to wear, so that teams could catch early signs of illness and prevent community spread of COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, the Oura smart ring and similar commercial monitoring devices have evolved from trackers that just count steps and calories to becoming people’s health coaches who push people into seeking medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Natalie Esparza, her Oura ring’s symptom warnings pushed her to go to the emergency room just in time. In February, when Esparza woke up vomiting and with severe stomach pain, she initially thought she had norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then she got the “major signs” of illness alert from her Oura, a message the app didn’t send when she actually had colds or norovirus in the past. Esparza decided to go to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed her with appendicitis and told the California resident that if she had waited longer, it would have elevated her risk of getting sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it wasn’t for the ring telling me that [major signs alert], I wouldn’t have gone. I probably would have waited a little bit longer to go to the hospital,” Esparza said. “For me personally, [the ring’s alert] was that final push. Like, ‘No, you gotta go.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esparza’s story mirrors the recent story of Paralympic track star Hunter Woodhall who also &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hunterwoodhall/video/7478393506948517166" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@hunterwoodhall/video/7478393506948517166" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok story that his Oura may have “saved” his life, because its “major signs” alert pushed him to go to a doctor and get diagnosed with appendicitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Woodhall thought his stomach cramps were due to eating cheese and having a lactose intolerance. But because it was the first time in his four years of wearing the ring that he saw that notification, Woodhall took the Oura’s warning seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so stubborn that I think without what this ring was telling me ... I don’t know if I would have gone to the hospital,” Woodhall said in his TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oura rings can be helpful health coaches. Just know that they can be wrong, too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you read about the above anecdotes, it might make you think an Oura ring is an all-knowing health god. But temper your expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable health trackers give users an extensive report of their biometrics, but don’t mistake what it tells you for infallible knowledge. One 2024 &lt;a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e56972/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="systematic review" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e56972/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 28 studies of wearable health devices’ ability to detect cardiovascular conditions, COVID and physical falls, found that this technology showed the most accuracy in identifying atrial fibrillation and COVID in particular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise physiologist Andrew Jagim, who has authored &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734757/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734757/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the accuracy of fitness trackers, said wearable devices can provide valuable feedback on how your body is doing “in terms of just overall physiological health.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagim specifically pointed out a sharp decline in heart rate variability (HRV) ― which Gooding showed in her own stats before her cancer diagnosis ― as a general indication that something is wrong, he said. Heart rate variability tracks fluctuations between heartbeats, so if you suddenly have low heart rate variability, it could be a worrisome sign that your body is becoming less resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a sign that “you could be sick, you could be run down, stress, [you did] not get enough sleep, or sometimes all of the above,” Jagim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He likens this sensitive biometrics symptom of HRV to a “‘check engine’ light where something’s wrong with your car. You just don’t exactly know what would be the issue until you get further testing done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Esparza said the Oura ring's warning validated her concern that she should go to the emergency room for her stomach pain. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So don’t panic if you get an alert from your wearable device that something is off. It might be because you had a hard workout the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagim, who uses an Oura, said he has gotten low readiness scores from his ring after two-hour workouts. It’s a reminder that downward trends from an Oura do not necessarily indicate something is severely wrong. “It’s OK for normal fluctuations in our physiology to occur. That’s just how our body responds to stress or intense activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you fly internationally, your HRV score might be low the next day because flying is stressful on the body, Jagim said. At the same time, he said that any alert about heart rate irregularity would be concerning enough for him to follow up with a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Jagim said that wearable technology is advancing rapidly enough that within the next five years, he expects devices to integrate their data with electronic health records, so that doctors could also get a heads up about concerning results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart health monitors can be both reassuring and panic-inducing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these devices are not for everyone. Many people report having to take off their smart devices because the information overload causes them too much anxiety to work out or sleep in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in Gooding’s own TikTok, people in her comments said that the “major signs” of illness language is too scary to receive. “I got [an Oura] to help with my health anxiety and it made it worse,” one TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@otikkiyousoofine/video/7478431303315000619" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="replied" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@otikkiyousoofine/video/7478431303315000619" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt; to Gooding’s story. That’s a normal response, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise scientist and sports psychology consultant Nicole Hagobian said the majority of athletes she works with actually get more anxiety from wearable devices than they do benefits, because they fixate on the data and negatively compare their stats with their peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to consider: How do I feel when I get this information on such a regular basis? It’s constant feedback,” Hagobian said. If the answer is “highly stressed,” then these smart trackers may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“For me personally, [the ring’s alert] was that final push. Like, ‘No, you gotta go.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Natalie Esparza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, too much information about yourself is not reassuring. If you already have a diagnosed health condition, this tracker might make you feel even more stressed. In one 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.033750" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.033750" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, patients with prior diagnosis of atrial fibrillation reported higher rates of calling their doctor and symptom management when they used a device that had cardiac monitoring features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagobian said it’s an example of how wearable devices can cause “hyper-seeking medical attention maybe when [people] don’t need it.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Esparza, what some people see as anxiety-invoking, she sees as a comforting health monitor that validates her worries. Esparza said her Oura’s warnings reassure her than when she shares the app screenshots saying something is wrong, “It’s not just me being a little bit hypochondriac.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before her appendicitis episode, Esparza would only recommend the expensive smart ring that can retail for hundreds of dollars if “you have FSA [flexible spending account] funds and you don’t know what to do.” But now, she wants to buy Ouras for her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

But beyond the cast and the storyline, there’s a scene-stealer — the anti-anxiety medication, lorazepam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug almost plays a character of its own in the show as kooky Southern mom Victoria Ratliff, played by actor Parker Posey, can’t seem to go anywhere — not even dinner — without popping one of the anti-anxiety pills and stashing the prescription in her purse. She even freely offers some to her husband, Timothy, who’s visibly stressed out about being caught in a money laundering scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point in the show, Posey also utters the memorable quote: “I don’t even have my lorazepam. I’m going to have to drink myself to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="local18_widget" class="impressionGAEvents"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the show has got you curious about the drug, you’re not alone. In fact, searches for the drug have spiked, reveals Google Trends. So what actually is this drug and what’s the right way to use it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-lorazepam"&gt;What is lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold under the brand name of Ativan, lorazepam belongs to the class of medications called benzodiazepines, which work to calm the central nervous system by slowing activity in the brain. Other famous benzodiazepines in the market are Valium, Xanax and Klonopin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As David Merrill, MD, PhD, board certified psychiatrist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, told &lt;em&gt;Women’s Health Mag&lt;/em&gt;, “Lorazepam is a nervous system sedative. It takes the edge off or reduces the level of alertness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mid-taboola"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam works by increasing a calming chemical in your brain called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Low levels of GABA can lead to overactive brain circuitry that contributes to anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-is-lorazepam-used-for"&gt;So, what is lorazepam used for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Victoria in &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/em&gt; suggests lorazepam is used mainly to treat anxiety. It is, however, also helpful for someone who struggles with insomnia, agitation, or to treat or prevent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Marino, MD, an assistant professor in the departments of emergency medicine and psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, told &lt;em&gt;SELF&lt;/em&gt;, “Lorazepam is most commonly used in very short-term situations for treatment of things like anxiety, panic attacks, and alcohol withdrawal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue Varma, a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, holds a similar view. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/em&gt;, she says, “Its accessibility and effectiveness in acute settings makes it a go-to for health care providers looking to alleviate immediate distress. It is most commonly used for short-term treatment, often while the patient works on long-term strategies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or lifestyle changes that address the root causes of anxiety or insomnia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img nw18-data-src="https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/04/lorazepam2-2025-04-34a4b93014dcc34e75b1c13ac01eebfc-1024x576.jpg" alt&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parker Posey in ‘The White Lotus’ seen with a prescription of lorazepam. Image Courtesy: HBO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, all medical experts and even the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) note that lorazepam should only be prescribed for periods of two to four weeks — unlike how Victoria keeps popping them in the HBO hit series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something that you should be consistently on, for life,” Thea Gallagher, PsyD, clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health, tells &lt;em&gt;SELF&lt;/em&gt;, adding, “It’s supposed to be used for situations when you’re feeling especially anxious and activated as a ‘bridge’ medication to help you manage that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-any-dangers-to-taking-lorazepam"&gt;Are there any dangers to taking lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are certain physical side effects to taking lorazepam. Some people, as doctors note, will complain of dizziness, confusion, memory issues and slowed breathing when they ingest the drug. In addition, the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) states that lorazepam could cause amnesia, vivid or disturbing dreams, irritability, or hostility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But besides the physical side effects, lorazepam is highly addictive, contrary to what Victoria claims in &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/em&gt; when she hands a lorazepam to her husband and says, “Take this, they’re not addicting, I just take one when I need it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical studies have found that this anti-anxiety drug is very habit-forming. Chelsie Rohrscheib, a neuroscientist and sleep specialist at Wesper in New York in a &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; report said, “This class of drug is extremely habit-forming, which means a patient taking it may become dependent and experience withdrawal symptoms once it’s discontinued.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Joseph Squitieri at Northwell Zucker Hillside Hospital in Queens, New York, also issued a similar word of caution to the use of lorazepam. “If you stop taking it suddenly, you can also develop a withdrawal from the medication, which actually could be very dangerous, could result in high blood pressure, seizures; that’s a life-threatening situation. A lot of people don’t realise that you can’t just stop it if you’re taking it regularly for a very long time,” he told &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the reason that in 2020, the US FDA released a new warning label for benzodiazepine boxes, which addresses the heightened risks of abuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions that can come with using the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical research has also shown that lorazepam can affect an individual’s mood and even raise a patient’s risk of depression. But that’s not all; studies have also revealed that long-term use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam is linked to neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img nw18-data-src="https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/04/lorazepam3-2025-04-fe6322499e8b1fdb5b046041d7f14bf0-1024x576.jpg" alt&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that treats anxiety disorder or panic disorder. File image/X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-you-consume-alcohol-with-lorazepam"&gt;Can you consume alcohol with lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/em&gt;, Victoria often downs her lorazepam with alcohol; in fact, she consumes copious amounts of liquor while being on the drug. This, experts, note is a huge red flag in the medical world and is indicative of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Gail Saltz, who serves as a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Centre, said in a &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt; report, “Alcohol specifically interacts with benzodiazepines. They both affect the GABA system. They both can cause, on their own, respiratory depression and death – meaning you stop breathing and die. But together, they are what’s called synergistic, meaning it makes each of them have more of that effect than the two of them on their own. So it’s dangerous. That’s why they tell you not to drink when you’re taking lorazepam.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-shouldnt-take-lorazepam"&gt;Who shouldn’t take lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are certain individuals who should steer clear of lorazepam, say doctors. These include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, elderly patients who are more sensitive to sedation, and individuals with certain medical conditions that may react to the medication (like severe liver disease and acute narrow-angle glaucoma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, those who have a history of substance abuse shouldn’t be prescribed lorazepam. As it is highly addictive, individuals who have struggled with alcohol, prescription drugs, or other substances should generally avoid the anti-anxiety medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With inputs from agencies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="livtv_and_video_widgt_wrap" data-livetv-switcher-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-redis?key=FP2.0_fact_live" data-featured-video-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-videos-list?fields=title,pg_id,id,mongo_id,sources,duration,created_at,shows.slug,shows.title,author_byline.name,images,weburl&amp;amp;sortBy=created_at&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;count=10&amp;amp;filter=%7b%22shows.slug%22:%22vantage%22,%22video_type%22:%22vod%22%7d" data-category="health" data-env="PROD" data-page-url="www.firstpost.com/health/hbo-the-white-lotus-lorazepam-anti-anxiety-drug-dangers-13876328.html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Firstpost</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:58:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNLXktSWxfSl95M21KQnR1MDJxbm5YX3Mtb2xEcHZmT1dzOUpSVmdnY2VNSVFmempHNEhfd19tcU9HbUVsNWpiVHNiaTdPVms5WWVXbnpWQTFkMTl3elBzbEZRNzYyWmQ1emxrcmxGYXVEd0dIUGRiSXdKSzJNQ0t3UE95alMtQWFkelNKMW9ma000Ykt0RnFXd3FKQk5hRG5fYmpQYtIBqgFBVV95cUxNNlgzUXBScVRrY040d05jSnFrOENOcHJjemtIZnZGX3haMS1nTVRwNUtsR2hrLXdJazVNemM5VjJWX0VueDF6Y2doaXNiV1ZILXJwM3hzOVZqTmhueWxZUHF0b3pXaFZfMHdYTjJxNGF4djFmWkV3UHRFSlRwTjNQdk9jNTVwa1h1bTMzZEFTY1NFWF95T1FNVUVxR0VQLWZwRmZBLUhPbEhyUQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
