It is best to avoid processed foods, she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/rates-dementia-lower-people-who-eat-specific-diet-research-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mediterranean or MIND-style diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, olive oil and whole grains, has been linked to a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Mediterranean or MIND-style diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, olive oil and whole grains, has been linked to a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Foods that contain antioxidants, such as purple, red and blue grapes; blueberries; red berries, like strawberries; green, leafy vegetables, like broccoli, kale and spinach; and sweet potatoes, acorn or butternut squash are recommended," Picone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee and tea drinkers have a lower risk of Parkinson's disease, the doctor noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 3: Limit exposure to toxins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to certain &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;, like pesticides and heavy metals, can damage neurons and increase the risk of Parkinson’s, according to Dr. George Michalopoulos, founder and chairman of The Neurologic Wellness Institute in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Aerobic exercise can be neuroprotective and improve motor function."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While it’s impossible to avoid all toxins, there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure," he told Fox News Digital. "Choose organic produce when possible, use protective gear if you’re working with chemicals, and drink filtered water to avoid contaminants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 4: Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain clears out waste products and repairs itself, Michalopoulos noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chronic sleep deprivation or conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; can increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s," he said. "Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens before bed and create a calming bedtime routine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/even-small-amounts-alcohol-linked-higher-dementia-risk-older-adults-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL LINKED TO HIGHER DEMENTIA RISK IN OLDER ADULTS, STUDY SHOWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vibhash Sharma, a neurologist and medical director of UT Southwestern’s neuromodulation movement disorders clinic in Dallas, Texas, reiterated the importance of quality sleep for Parkinson’s prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As poor sleep quality and chronic sleep deprivation are associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, quality and adequate sleep is important for supporting brain repair and clearing abnormal proteins linked to Parkinson’s disease," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 5: Manage stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is a part of life, but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chronic levels&lt;/a&gt; can take a toll on your brain, Picone cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s been linked to inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are thought to play a role in Parkinson’s," she said. "Finding ways to manage stress can help protect your brain and improve your overall health.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3r9z26000x27pac8d440am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00023d60cr43gqeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00033d608cjvbmpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00043d60ocvkc9u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4515?adobe_mc=MCMID=32040115521268807963986547309462626171%25257CMCORGID=242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%25252540AdobeOrg%25257CTS=1761227097" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Science.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00053d60vqy2s9er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00063d60x4oyxi69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00073d60vfnq3jsn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00093d602tlzq08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000a3d60avpflu6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000b3d604zjes5f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000c3d60e5utgax3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000d3d60oxin9equ@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000e3d60k07xmk17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3426333/" target="_blank"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000g3d6017nfk1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000j3d60rbhirb28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000k3d604iio6tm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000l3d60w124hfbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000m3d60vzsl76i8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000n3d6010wyn7z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Along with an unfriendly clime, these winter months can usher in some unwelcome feelings in the guise of the “winter blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the winter blues, and how can you get your energy back if all you want to do is bundle up and hibernate the season away? We spoke with several experts to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winter blues are fairly common, Amy Sedgwick, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MountainsideTreatment/"&gt;Mountainside, a rehabilitation center&lt;/a&gt;, explains. She explains that the winter blues are usually amplified feelings of stress and/or sadness that many experience around the holiday season, typically starting when daylight saving time ends in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Less sunlight, shorter days, and the pressure to remain upbeat during the holiday season can cause people to feel withdrawn and upset, even if they have never been diagnosed with depression,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the winter blues, or feeling down or depressed when the days are shorter and the nights are longer, could be a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder" rel="nofollow"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt;. This is a specific type of depression that is only present during certain parts of the year, and wintertime is the most common season for it to crop up. If you are feeling exceptionally sad and/or hopeless, it may be time to see a doctor or mental health professional. But for your average cases of winter blues, these tips from experts should help get you out of your funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of energy often accompanies a general feeling of being down in the dumps. How can you get a little pep back in your step if you just want to cover yourself in blankets and binge Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People who don’t feel like hibernating slugs every winter swear by these 7 energy habits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

While common symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice, and unexplained weight loss, recent research shows that certain leg symptoms may appear first. Patients may experience pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in the legs, which can serve as early warning signs of pancreatic cancer. Recognising these subtle indicators is vital for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving survival rates. With pancreatic cancer causing over a million deaths globally each year, awareness of both traditional and early leg symptoms is crucial for prevention and early intervention. This aggressive cancer often spreads quickly to nearby organs and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, making early detection and awareness even more essential.

Pain in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent or unexplained pain in the legs can be a subtle yet significant warning sign. This discomfort may arise from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the legs. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the context of pancreatic cancer, DVT can occur due to the body's altered clotting mechanisms, which are influenced by the presence of cancerous cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Swelling in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexplained swelling in one or both legs, especially if it develops suddenly, can indicate the presence of a blood clot or other circulatory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pancreatic cancer patients, such swelling may be linked to DVT or the compression of blood vessels by tumour growth, leading to impaired blood flow. Persistent swelling accompanied by pain, redness, or warmth should be evaluated promptly, as early detection can prevent serious complications and improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Redness in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redness or a reddish hue in the skin of the legs can be a sign of inflammation or infection. In the case of DVT associated with pancreatic cancer, the affected area may appear red due to increased blood flow as the body attempts to combat the clot. This discolouration is often accompanied by warmth, tenderness, and mild swelling, indicating underlying circulatory issues that require immediate medical evaluation to prevent potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Warmth in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensation of warmth in the legs, particularly around the swollen or painful areas, can indicate inflammation. This warmth is often a response to the body's immune system reacting to the clot or tumour. In pancreatic cancer, such symptoms may be among the first to manifest, preceding more typical signs like jaundice or abdominal pain. Persistent warmth accompanied by redness, tenderness, or swelling should not be ignored, as it may signal deep vein thrombosis or tumour-related vascular complications requiring prompt medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;See More: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cancer-breakthrough-scientists-discover-protein-that-could-stop-tumour-growth-in-the-pancreas/articleshow/124158628.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer breakthrough: Scientists discover protein that could stop tumour growth in the pancreas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do these symptoms matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these leg symptoms, especially when they occur without an obvious cause, should not be dismissed.

The other was pelvic tilts, which felt so good in my lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises not only stretched my lower back, but also activated the muscles surrounding it, which should help to reduce stiffness in the long term, so I’ll definitely come back to these moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the video took the same approach to a series of exercises, performing them dynamically first—moving in and out of position—and then passively, holding the stretch for a few breaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves include supine twists, extended child’s pose and cat-cow, all of which felt great for my stiff back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a satisfying routine for someone like me with an achy lower back and my entire body felt less stiff after doing it. I’d recommend it for anyone who needs a short break from a sedentary routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2b349082-5d31-4c67-9fcd-82e9461157ab"&gt;It’s been a hit in the comments too, and a few people have said it reminds them of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;lower back love video&lt;/a&gt; Mishler published in 2014.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roanoke, Virginia&lt;/em&gt; — As a 10-year-old, Autumn Bushman loved to perform. The fourth-grade cheerleader from Salem, Virginia, was a bundle of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She really turned my living room into a dance floor," her mother, Summer Bushman, told CBS News. "She never sat still...She really did care about others more than she cared about herself." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the past couple of years, Summer says Autumn was bullied in school over her braces. The abuse also continued after school on her smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, at the age of 10, Autumn died by suicide at night in her bedroom. Records show she was looking at her phone's screen just before it happened, Summer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer told CBS News her daughter would take her phone to bed at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had questioned that a couple of times, and she fought back and said, 'Mom, I need my alarm,'" Summer said. "And every single morning when I'd wake her up, she had her alarm going off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from researchers at Virginia Tech shows nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines are linked to teen suicide attempts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/study-sheds-light-on-overdose-suicide-attempts-among-youth-and-w.html?utm_campaign=organicVTunirel&amp;amp;utm_medium=Virginia+Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=cmpgn_soc&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawNneY5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFxanNqNXVTMXlNeUlsSmpGAR737BMQJHB22mLCWTHsWIJtbwcl6ubTD5zzqasiJYE_BhaVrtbisodKMXhA0g_aem_O5CsolpF6bKgGiuJh9YUhA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The study examined&lt;/a&gt; data of children ages 12 to 17 who had been admitted to a hospital after attempting suicide by intentionally overdosing. It found that about two-thirds of those overdosed after 8 p.m., and approximately three out of four were on screens right before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very distracting and disturbs your sleep," Dr. Abhishek Reddy, a clinical psychiatrist and professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine who conducted the research, said of screen use before bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddy added that it is "pretty dangerous" for bullied children to take their phones to bed at night "because during the daytime, you can talk to people, you can talk to school counselors, you can talk to your family members, friends. But at nighttime, all that access is cut off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends keeping phones out of bedrooms, practicing good sleep hygiene, and reducing access to all medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I come in here and I think, you know, it's been six months since she's been gone, it's been seven months since she's been gone. And then I think to myself, I have to go the rest of my life without seeing her again," Summer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer wishes she had never given Autumn a smartphone so young, let alone allowed her to use it at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She deserved to live life, and I will never see her go to a homecoming or prom," Summer said. "I'll never see her, you know, get married, or in a wedding dress. And that's really difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by calling or texting 988.

            It’s not surprising that many people fear the dentist. Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00063b6n8lk4gh5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00073b6n4kvi97pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a way off, but at King’s College London, Ana Angelova Volponi, director of the postgraduate program in regenerative dentistry, has been experimenting with lab-grown teeth for almost two decades, and was part of a team that in 2013 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23458883/" target="_blank"&gt;grew a tooth &lt;/a&gt;from human and mouse cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00083b6nx32ub98d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, she led a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532305/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00093b6ne7zrtypj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea of creating lab-grown teeth dates back to the 1980s, Volponi said, but the one that she and her colleagues created over a decade ago was the first that used adult human gingival cells — which make up the gums and are obtained by lightly scratching the inside of the mouth — and combined them with “progenitor” tooth cells taken from a mouse embryo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000a3b6n6eksaw8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000b3b6nksdqhjnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The environment, which researchers call a “scaffold,” is essential to the formation of the lab-grown tooth, and it’s the subject of Volponi’s most recent study. In 2013, Volponi used a scaffold made of the protein collagen, but now uses a hydrogel, a type of polymer with a high water content, explained Xuechen Zhang, a doctoral student at King’s College London, and a co-author of the study. “We gather the cells first from the mouse embryos and then mix them together and spin them down to get a small cell pellet,” he said. “Then we inject this cell pellet inside the hydrogel and grow it for around eight days.” Because the work focused on the environment, human cells aren’t needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            At the end of the eight days, tooth-like structures will have formed inside the hydrogel, which was developed in collaboration with Imperial College London. In the 2013 research, these “tooth primordia” were transferred into a mouse where they developed into a tooth structure complete with developing roots and enamel.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000d3b6nyj8yc13m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000e3b6nrxthzi6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000g3b6n7cdnstyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000h3b6nlyrkjpm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh39e1pm00153b6nipf3rorz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000j3b6nhcte4hnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000k3b6n7zilp2pt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late 2024, a team led by Pamela Yelick at the School of Dental Medicine of Tufts University, grew human-like teeth — created from human and pig cells — &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/04/24/pigs-can-regrow-their-adult-teeth-what-if-humans-could-too" target="_blank"&gt;in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Pigs, unlike humans, regrow their teeth several times over the course of their lives. The ultimate aim is to prompt cells in a human jaw to grow new teeth, without using any pig cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000l3b6nuc19zrso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, &lt;a href="https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/teaming-up-for-living-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;has successfully grown&lt;/a&gt; dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000m3b6n1uyj51tw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The insulin nasal spray, which delivers insulin straight to the brain, has also been shown to keep brain cells healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out in the US, the trial shows some early signs of progress in maintaining brain health in those at risk of Alzheimer's. It enrolled 47 older adults aged 55 to 85 years, 42 of whom completed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, or were cognitively fine but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu387"&gt;showed signs of molecular changes&lt;/a&gt; linked to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were given either empagliflozin alone, the insulin spray on its own, both medications together, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;or a placebo&lt;/a&gt;, for four weeks. The trial was too small to detect any  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="178152" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; differences between the groups (its main aim was testing safety); however, some trends were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we found that empagliflozin, an established diabetes and heart medication, reduced markers of brain injury while restoring blood flow in critical brain regions," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Suzanne Craft from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also confirmed that delivering insulin directly to the brain with a newly validated device enhances cognition, neurovascular health, and immune function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-178155 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-639x675.jpg 639w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TauProteins-600x634.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178155" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of the benefits seen with empagliflozin (EMPA-Only) was signs of less tau build-up in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (Erichsen et al., &lt;em&gt;A&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a diabetes drug, empagliflozin improves the way the body handles glucose and sodium. This has a lot of further effects, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-inflammatory-diets-are-all-over-tiktok-heres-what-the-science-says"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stress on cells, better energy efficiency, and improved insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the medication was shown to reduce the levels of the tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid, a protein that we know can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial"&gt;form harmful clumps&lt;/a&gt; in Alzheimer's brains. It also had benefits in terms of blood flow and cholesterol levels, and several other biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insulin nasal spray was chosen because insulin resistance has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasal-spray-may-slow-alzheimers-disease-study-in-mice-suggests"&gt;previously been linked&lt;/a&gt; to Alzheimer's, and previous research shows insulin's effects on brain cells can help improve immune responses, white matter structure, and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, participants given the insulin spray saw better scores on cognitive tests measuring memory and thinking. Through brain scans, the researchers observed benefits in white matter connectivity and blood flow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers"&gt;linked to memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body's metabolism, or the way it turns fuel into energy, is crucial to good health, and these treatments focus more on that, rather than some of the later, end-stage effects of Alzheimer's we see in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that targeting metabolism can change the course of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/news-releases/2025/10/new-trial-finds-diabetes-drug-and-nasal-insulin-improve-brain-health-in-early-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Craft.

			&lt;p&gt;New guidelines on what to eat and drink if you have chronic (long-term) constipation have been making news in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the British Dietetic Association's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.70133"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has focused on advice to eat kiwifruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other recommendations have not received so much attention. One, in particular, marks a shift in managing chronic constipation. The guidelines don't advise a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-type-of-fiber-may-have-weight-loss-benefits-similar-to-ozempic"&gt;A Type of Fiber May Have Weight Loss Benefits Similar to Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the guidelines say help (and don't help) to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the guidelines look at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 75  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to come up with recommendations for food, drink and supplements for chronic constipation in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical trials varied and so they had to come up with a consensus on the quality of the trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that constipation means different things to different people, they used a very broad definition for constipation. This encompassed what patients perceived to be constipation as well as definitions of constipation used in clinical trials. Chronic constipation is generally when someone passes few, hard stools over a period of at least three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg" alt="kiwi fruit halved" class="wp-image-178895 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers recommend eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-kiwi-cut-in-half-GAMExm6pQI0"&gt;Стейси Сакс/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers produced 59 recommendations. However, the researchers said most of the recommendations were based on poor-quality evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why kiwifruit? How many a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommended eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. Whether it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002124"&gt;green kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194146"&gt;gold kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; the evidence clearly shows they can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how? There are several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre in kiwifruit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2002.00287.x"&gt;swells a lot&lt;/a&gt; when mixed with water, more so than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394294-4.00005-5"&gt;apple fibre&lt;/a&gt;. This swelling helps make stools more bulky, easing their way through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating the whole fruit including the skin provides more fibre than just eating the flesh but eating the kiwifruit without the skin is perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green kiwifruit contains an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114513003401"&gt;actinidin&lt;/a&gt; that helps the body digest protein in the stomach and the small intestine. This may help with constipation by making food proteins softer and easier to pass through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit contain a type of crystal called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2017.1327841"&gt;raphides&lt;/a&gt;. These are believed to increase mucus production in the gut, lubricating it and helping passage of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwifruit may also result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300646m"&gt;reduced species of methane producing bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.655"&gt;linked to constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mineral water and magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported on the benefits of drinking mineral water. They suggested drinking 0.5–1.5 litres a day (roughly two to six cups) of mineral water for two to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Mineral water &lt;a href="https://afcd.foodstandards.gov.au/fooddetails.aspx?PFKID=F005696"&gt;often contains magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072052"&gt;acts as a laxative&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, magnesium oxide is often used as a dietary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020421"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines confirmed magnesium oxide can help soften the stool and increase stool frequency. The researchers recommended taking 0.5–1. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; a day for at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this may not be appropriate for everyone. For instance people with kidney disease need to be careful. Magnesium supplements may also interact with other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rye bread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cited &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118570"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; rye bread relieves constipation more than white bread or common laxatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended six to eight slices a day of rye bread for at least three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this just isn't realistic for a lot of people. And as rye contains gluten, this would not be appropriate for people with coeliac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-fibre diet may not be needed after all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one key surprise in the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a lack of strong evidence for generic high-fibre diets for constipation, when people eat at &lt;a href="https://nutritionaustralia.org/resources/fibre-2/"&gt;least 25g&lt;/a&gt; of fibre a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rationale. The researchers could only find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.01.012"&gt;one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; – the gold standard for testing interventions, such as a change in diet – where a high-fibre diet (25–30g/day) was compared with a low-fibre diet (15–20g/day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial showed no benefit for the high-fibre diet in improving constipation. People on the low-fibre diet farted less and were less bloated than people on the high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean fibre doesn't help constipation. There is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13662"&gt;good evidence&lt;/a&gt; for supplementing your diet with more fibre to help chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than focusing on a high-fibre diet for constipation, the guidelines instead recommend taking at least 10g a day of a fibre supplement, such as psyllium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet is usually a key part of national dietary guidelines. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends some adults have a dietary fibre intake of at least 28g a day. There are certainly health benefits such as lowered cholesterol and blood sugar levels from eating a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we now know it's not needed to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we take away from the guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines provide more personalised, evidence-based dietary advice tailored to patient symptoms than previous guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit are considered a safe and effective treatment for chronic constipation. Mineral water, magnesium supplements and rye bread can help too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would be worth discussing magnesium supplements with a health professional, especially if there are concerns about kidney disease or you take other medications.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267617/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study has revealed that gluten sensitivity, which affects approximately 10% of the global population, is not actually about gluten but part of the way the gut and brain interact.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings are expected to set a new benchmark for how gluten sensitivity is defined, diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research review, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673625015338" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;, examined current published evidence for non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) to better understand this highly prevalent condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with NCGS experience symptoms after consuming gluten but do not have celiac disease, an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten. Common symptoms include bloating, gut pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, University of Melbourne Associate Professor Jessica Biesiekierski, said the findings overturn long-held assumptions about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gluten+sensitivity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gluten sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to popular belief, most people with NCGS aren't reacting to gluten," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that symptoms are more often triggered by fermentable carbohydrates, commonly known as FODMAPs, by other wheat components or by people's expectations and prior experiences with food."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest combined analysis, only a few tightly controlled trials found any real gluten reaction. Overall, people's responses were no different from when they were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Across recent studies, people with IBS who believe they're gluten-sensitive react similarly to gluten, wheat, and placebo. This suggests that how people anticipate and interpret gut sensations can strongly influence their symptoms," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Taken together, this redefines NCGS as part of the gut–brain interaction spectrum, closer to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, rather than a distinct gluten disorder."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team—from Australia, The Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom—say the findings have major implications for people self-managing gut symptoms, for clinicians prescribing restrictive diets, and for policymakers shaping public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Millions of people around the world avoid gluten believing it harms their gut, often after experiencing real symptoms that range from mild discomfort to severe distress. Improving our scientific and clinical understanding of a condition affecting up to 15% of the global population is incredibly important," Associate Professor Biesiekierski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Jason Tye-Din, Director of the Snow Centre for Immune Health and a gastroenterologist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the updated scientific knowledge could help clinicians provide more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment for patients who present with NCGS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Distinguishing NCGS from related gut conditions is essential for clinicians to offer accurate diagnosis and individualized care, as well as treating underlying drivers," Professor Tye-Din said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This review supports a more personalized, evidence-based approach to gut health and avoids unnecessary dietary restriction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Biesiekierski added that effective care for people with NCGS should combine dietary modifications with psychological support, while ensuring nutritional adequacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We would like to see public health messaging shift away from the narrative that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gluten/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gluten&lt;/a&gt; is inherently harmful, as this research shows that this often isn't the case," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings additionally call for better diagnostic tools, more rigorous clinical pathways and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/research+funding/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;research funding&lt;/a&gt; in this field, as well as improved public education and food labeling."&lt;/p&gt;

Many people turn to tried-and-true medications, like minoxidil, the active ingredient in products like Rogaine. Despite a recent connection to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a65130958/are-hair-loss-supplements-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain health risks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;certain health risks&lt;/a&gt;, many of these solutions are relatively inexpensive and available over-the-counter—a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are exploring a way to make minoxidil more effective for hair loss—and it involves stevia. You’re probably familiar with stevia as a sweetener, and this hair loss hack actually repurposes it. It specifically uses the sweetener stevioside, which is derived from the stevia plant, to help stimulate hair growth. The research on this is still in its infancy, and this particular study was done on mice, not humans. But the findings are impressive enough that they’re already getting plenty of attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital; &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the link between stevia and hair growth? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202503575" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For the study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;For the study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers combined stevioside with microneedle patches, which use tiny microneedles to help deliver an active ingredient—in this case, minoxidil—into the skin. The researchers tested this in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose their hair and discovered that more of the minoxidil made it into the skin and more hair grew back in the mice that used the patches with stevioside compared to those that just received minoxidil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the stevioside patches caused the mice to regrow hair across 67.5 percent of the treatment area with hair after 35 days. Mice with different treatment options didn’t see as big of an impact, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might stevia help with hair growth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s still being explored, but the researchers have a theory: Stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve better in water and, in theory, that can help more minoxidil get under the skin and into the hair follicles to push for more growth. In essence, the stevioside “acts as a natural absorption enhancer,” explains &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Minoxidil has limited skin permeability, which restricts its effectiveness in traditional applications,” he continues. But minoxidil in dissolving microneedles that are enhanced with something like stevioside can bypass your skin’s resistance to support more minoxidil penetration and, hopefully, create more of an impact, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s important to point out that more research is needed. “I do microneedling in combination with minoxidil to improve efficacy in my practice,” says &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics. “But we need controlled trials for the efficacy with adding stevioside and also the safety. We don’t know what the potential side effects could look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't put stevia directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have stevia and minoxidil at home, it’s tempting to want to DIY. But Dr. Goldenberg says that’s unlikely to help. “Without the microneedling, applying stevia onto your scalp won't help much,” he says. “Minoxidil would still have the same absorption issue as using it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to see a dermatologist if you’re dealing with hair loss, Rodney says. “Minoxidil is very useful for some types of hair loss and it’s something you can use at home while you wait to get into the dermatologist’s office,” she says. “But there are many different types of hair loss with different causes and treatments. Depending on the cause of your hair loss, minoxidil may not be the specific or only answer.” Some stand-by treatments dermatologists consistently recommend are here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2% Minoxidil Topical Solution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This solution contains 2% minoxidil, the only FDA-approved topical ingredient to deal with hair loss.

"This helps thin mucus, making it easier to clear through coughing or blowing your nose, reducing congestion and lowering the risk of secondary infections like bronchitis, sinusitis and pneumonia. Increased fluid intake also helps with transporting nutrients and immune cells throughout the body, which is particularly important when we are fighting infection."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are vomiting or experiencing diarrhea, both experts say that this increases the risk for dehydration and rapid electrolyte loss. “Electrolyte imbalance can cause weakness, confusion and even hospitalization, if it’s severe,” Dr. Petersen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experts stress that hydration during sickness is even more important for older adults. “For older adults, hydration is not just about comfort, but also about preventing complications, supporting immune function and enabling a safe recovery from illness. Even mild dehydration can lead to significantly worse outcomes in older adults,” Dr. Shah warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-to-immune-system-when-you-cut-down-sugar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here's Exactly What Happens to Your Immune System When You Cut Back on Sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here's Exactly What Happens to Your Immune System When You Cut Back on Sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Petersen, older adults are at a higher risk for dehydration due to a diminished thirst sensation that naturally happens with age. “Older adults may not feel thirsty even when their bodies need fluids,” she explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of that, she says that aging reduces muscle mass, and since muscles store water, this means that older adults have less water stored in their bodies than when they were younger. She explains that some medications are diuretics, which increase fluid loss, another reason why older adults are more at risk for dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Much Fluid To Drink and Tips for Staying Hydrated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re over 60, Dr. Petersen says that it’s recommended to drink between six and eight cups of water (or other liquids) per day when you’re not sick. When you’re battling a sickness, she recommends drinking an additional one to two cups to best support the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is a general guideline, that exact hydration needs vary, based on one’s individual health. “A good general guideline, unless your doctor has ordered a fluid restriction, is to drink roughly half your weight in ounces. So, if you weigh 120 pounds, you would try for about 60 ounces (120 divided by 2) in water per day under normal circumstances, and add another 16 to 30 ounces during an illness, if possible,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-doctors-avoid-getting-sick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here's Everything Doctors Do To Avoid Getting Sick During Cold and Flu Season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here's Everything Doctors Do To Avoid Getting Sick During Cold and Flu Season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you’re sick, you may not feel like eating or drinking anything. But Dr. Shah says you should still do so, meeting your hydration goal with gradual liquid intake throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best types of fluid are water and clear, warm liquids such as herbal teas, broths and soups. These can help soothe sore throats and coughs. Oral rehydration solutions, such as Gatorade, can also be used, but are typically more helpful when people are having significant losses such as high fevers, diarrhea or vomiting. You should also avoid caffeinated beverages or alcoholic beverages during these times as they can increase fluid loss,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, hydration is a key part of recovery. Remember, the body needs adequate hydration even on days when you’re feeling your best. When you’re sick, it’s even more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/flu-symptoms-2025-2026" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-people-over-60-should-never-ever-do-when-theyre-sick" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Oct 23, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

    &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five urinary tract infections in a group of patients in Southern California were linked to E. coli from contaminated meat, a four-year study found. And researchers say the problem could be occurring across the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found 18% of the more than 2,300 urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the study — published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mBio&lt;/a&gt; journal on Thursday — were linked to E. coli strains found in meat samples from grocery stores in the same area. The meats most commonly found to test positive for E. coli were turkey and chicken, followed by pork and beef, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/uti/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. They disproportionately affect female and elder patients, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem," Lance B. Price, senior study author and professor at the George Washington University, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102657" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up new avenues for prevention, especially for vulnerable communities that bear a disproportionate burden." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in low-income areas had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs compared to those in wealthier neighborhoods, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the reasons for the strong correlation between poverty rate and foodborne UTIs are unclear, the authors say possible factors include inadequate food safety regulations, poor retail conditions and improper food handling and hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price added these findings show why there should be more investments, not less, in research about the social determinants of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your risk of infection should not depend on your ZIP code," Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more strict measures are put in place by meat producers and regulatory agencies, the authors of the study advise consumers exercise caution when handling raw meat to prevent infection. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five urinary tract infections in a group of patients in Southern California were linked to E. coli from contaminated meat, a four-year study found. And researchers say the problem could be occurring across the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found 18% of the more than 2,300 urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the study — published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mBio&lt;/a&gt; journal on Thursday — were linked to E. coli strains found in meat samples from grocery stores in the same area. The meats most commonly found to test positive for E. coli were turkey and chicken, followed by pork and beef, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/uti/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. They disproportionately affect female and elder patients, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem," Lance B. Price, senior study author and professor at the George Washington University, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102657" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up new avenues for prevention, especially for vulnerable communities that bear a disproportionate burden." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in low-income areas had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs compared to those in wealthier neighborhoods, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the reasons for the strong correlation between poverty rate and foodborne UTIs are unclear, the authors say possible factors include inadequate food safety regulations, poor retail conditions and improper food handling and hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price added these findings show why there should be more investments, not less, in research about the social determinants of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your risk of infection should not depend on your ZIP code," Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more strict measures are put in place by meat producers and regulatory agencies, the authors of the study advise consumers exercise caution when handling raw meat to prevent infection. &lt;/p&gt;

In one of the largest studies to date, MRI data from 40,000 adults revealed that impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow predicts dementia risk years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure can damage this system, worsening toxin buildup in the brain. Improving sleep quality and managing blood pressure could help keep this system functioning and lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste Clearance Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Impaired glymphatic system function predicted dementia risk in 40,000 adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiovascular Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure and other vascular risk factors disrupted brain waste flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Good sleep and blood pressure control may protect glymphatic function and reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems with the brain’s waste clearance system could underlie many cases of dementia and help explain why poor sleep patterns and cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers at the University of Cambridge found that impaired movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) – the clear liquid that cushions and cleans the brain – predicted risk of dementia later in life among 40,000 adults recruited to the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113529"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/dementia-glymphatic-system-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sleep plays an important role in glymphatic function, and so disrupted sleep patterns are likely to impair its ability to clear toxins. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings are published today in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the healthy brain, the so-called glymphatic system serves to clear out toxins and waste materials, keeping the brain healthy. Only discovered as recently as 2012, this system functions by flushing CSF through the brain along tiny channels around blood vessels known as perivascular spaces. It collects waste then drains out of the brain, helping keep it clean and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glymphatic system is thought to be important in protecting against many of the common forms of dementia, which are often characterised by the build-up of toxic substances in the brain – for example, Alzheimer’s disease sees amyloid ‘plaques’ and tau ‘tangles accumulate in brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common forms of dementia is vascular dementia, caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. The most common cause of this type of dementia is cerebral small vessel disease, which affects the small blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the impact of cerebral small vessel disease is even greater because it also interacts with other dementias making them worse; for example, a study of nuns in the US found that among those nuns whose brains showed signs of Alzheimer’s disease post mortem, only around a half exhibited symptoms of dementia – but this increased to around nine in 10 if they also had cerebral small vessel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Hugh Markus and colleagues at the University of Cambridge wanted to see whether cerebral small vessel disease and other cardiovascular risk factors damage the glymphatic system – and whether this in turn increases the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it has only been possible to study glymphatic function in mice, but recent advances in MRI scanning have made it possible to study it indirectly in humans. Even so, it was only possible to do this practically in relatively small numbers, but Yutong Chen, while a medical student at the University of Cambridge, developed machine learning algorithms capable of assessing glymphatic functions from MRI scans at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team applied the algorithm to MRI scans taken from around 40,000 adults in UK Biobank. They found three biomarkers – biological signatures – associated with impaired glymphatic function assessed at baseline, predicted the risk of dementia occurring over the subsequent decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these was DTI-ALPS, a measure of the diffusion of water molecules along the perivascular spaces. Another was the size of the choroid plexus, where the CSF is produced. The third measure reflected the flow velocity of CSF into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yutong Chen, from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Cambridge, said: “Although we have to be cautious about indirect markers, our work provides good evidence in a very large cohort that disruption of the glymphatic system plays a role in dementia. This is exciting because it allows to ask: how can we improve this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that several cardiovascular risk factors impaired glymphatic function – and hence increased dementia risk, and that this was partly via causing cerebral small vessel disease, which is visible in the MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Hui Hong, now a radiologist at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, said: “We already have evidence that small vessel disease in the brain accelerates diseases like Alzheimer’s, and now we have a likely explanation why. Disruption to the glymphatic system is likely to impair our ability to clear the brain of the amyloid and tau that causes Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests possible approaches for reducing dementia risk. One is to look at strategies for improving glymphatic function. Sleep plays an important role in glymphatic function, and so disrupted sleep patterns are likely to impair its ability to clear toxins. Alternatively, there may be existing medicines that could be repurposed, or new ones that could be developed, to improve glymphatic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible approach is to treat vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure. This is supported by recent studies: the SPRINT MIND trial, for example, showed that intensive blood pressure control (maintaining a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg) led to a 20% reduction in cognitive decline or dementia compared to participants in the standard treatment group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Markus, who leads the Stroke Research Group at the University of Cambridge and is a Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, said: “We already know the importance of cardiovascular risk factors when it comes to dementia, and our findings further emphasise this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At least a quarter of all dementia risk is accounted for by common risk factors like blood pressure and smoking. If these impair glymphatic function, then we can intervene. Treating high blood pressure or encouraging people to stop smoking would be an achievable way to helping the glymphatic system work better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bryan Williams, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at the British Heart Foundation, said:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“This study offers us a fascinating glimpse into how problems with the brain’s waste clearance system could be quietly increasing the chances of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By improving our understanding of the glymphatic system, this study opens exciting new avenues for research to treat and prevent dementia. It also emphasises the importance of managing known cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, for reducing dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation, with additional support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239834973"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What is the glymphatic system and why is it important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The glymphatic system is the brain’s cleaning network that flushes out toxins and waste through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Disruption of this system can lead to toxin buildup, potentially contributing to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239844481"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How do cardiovascular factors affect dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: High blood pressure and small vessel disease impair glymphatic flow, reducing the brain’s ability to remove waste such as amyloid and tau proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761239860807"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can improving sleep or lowering blood pressure reduce dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory loss may not simply be a symptom of getting older. New research from Virginia Tech shows that it's tied to specific molecular changes in the brain and that adjusting those processes can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In two complementary studies, Timothy Jarome, associate professor in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences' School of Animal Sciences, and his graduate students used gene-editing tools to target those age-related changes to improve memory performance in older subjects. The work was conducted on rats, a standard model for studying how memory changes with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it's a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease," said Jarome, who also holds an appointment in the School of Neuroscience. "This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied. If we can understand what's driving it at the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+level/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting memory loss in two key brain regions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(25)00714-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt; and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the team examined a process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts as a molecular tagging system that tells proteins inside the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; how to behave. When the system functions normally, it helps brain cells communicate and form memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarome and his team found that aging disrupts K63 polyubiquitination in two distinct areas of the brain. In the hippocampus, which helps form and retrieve memories, levels of K63 polyubiquitination increase with age. Using the CRISPR-dCas13 RNA editing system to reduce these levels, the researchers were able to improve memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the amygdala, which is important for emotional memory, the researchers noted that K63 polyubiquitination declines with age. By reducing it even further, they were able to boost memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain's aging process," Jarome said. "In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Reactivating a gene that supports memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923025003211?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;i&gt;Brain Research Bulletin&lt;/i&gt; and led by Jarome with doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene that supports memory formation. As the brain ages, IGF2 activity drops as the gene becomes chemically silenced in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that's imprinted, which means it's expressed from only one parental copy," Jarome said. "When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this silencing happens through DNA methylation, a natural process in which chemical tags accumulate on the gene and switch it off. Using a precise gene-editing tool, CRISPR-dCas9, they removed those tags and reactivated the gene. The result was better memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We essentially turned the gene back on," Jarome said. "When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn't yet have memory problems weren't affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the two studies show that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt; is not caused by a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/single+molecule/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single molecule&lt;/a&gt; or pathway and that multiple molecular systems likely contribute to how the brain ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once," he said. "If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer's disease, we have to look at the broader picture."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Collaborative, graduate-led research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both studies were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome's lab and supported through collaborations with scientists at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State. Yeeun Bae, who completed her doctoral work with Jarome in the School of Animal Sciences, led the study on K63 polyubiquitination. Shannon Kincaid, a doctoral student in the same program, led the study on IGF2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These projects represent the kind of graduate-led, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/collaborative+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;collaborative research&lt;/a&gt; that defines our work," Jarome said. "Our students are deeply involved in designing experiments, analyzing data, and helping shape the scientific questions we pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone has some memory decline as they get older," he said. "But when it becomes abnormal, the risk for Alzheimer's disease rises. What we're learning is that some of those changes happening at a molecular level can be corrected—and that gives us a path forward to potential treatments."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jaq2a000y3b79jg1yr6xi@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich Juzwiak:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that’s a good question.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jared00183b79v4kjsebx@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot deal with the writer’s actual question until we address why the wife is douching. The writer is not in a position to give us answers to any questions, and it’s not really their place to say, “Hey, wife, we haven’t had sex in two weeks. And now randomly I’m asking, why were you douching?” But please, don’t douche.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jat6z001i3b79170rgxka@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;It seems like one of the most straightforward, unhealthy products of capitalism made under the guise of being for women’s reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jav2p001s3b79b90vdhxq@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; In very rare circumstances, there might be a short-term, specific medical use for it. But the douche as a cleanliness product, just for the sake of it, is not good for you. I cannot walk past the word douche without a public service announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jawqa00223b79i34et6vz@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Every expert that I’ve ever seen talk about it has said not to do it.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;And obviously, anal douching is a different thing. You’re supposed to do that with clean water, and that’s strictly for the purpose of making one’s asshole not shitty during anal sex. So that’s a different kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jayro002c3b796mtsegmc@published"&gt;It’s funny that you bring it up, because my question after reading this was, what’s so traumatic about douching? What if this guy is super knowledgeable about women’s health, and it’s the very fact that she’s doing this? He can’t believe she would do that to her body.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb0l1002m3b79rhdphuox@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;He’s like, “Oh, my God, until two weeks ago, I thought my wife was a mature adult with functional judgment skills, and it turns out now I can’t look at her the same way.” That is a funny scenario. I think it’s more likely that he is grossed out by the fact of her having a body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb21n002w3b79cwkdjobh@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, it seems like that would be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb32800363b79v0y5i9ob@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/dear-prudence-secret-discovery-worst-way.html"&gt;Dear Prudence column&lt;/a&gt;, there was an ideologically body-positive woman, but she was struggling to connect that ideology in practical terms to how she thinks about her own body. And Jenée told her to look at people with bodies similar to yours being people, doing things everybody does, until that feels normalized. I think that might be useful here. Read some subreddits related to women’s health. Just walk right up to the thing that you never really had to realize before, and kind of rub your own face in it a little bit. Hear about some of the gross stuff. Actually, that might completely backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb4vi003g3b79cnokb4ob@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;It can be shocking to actually consider the full extent of your partner’s humanity and existence in a body, but I think it speaks to a rift in intimacy, that you’d be able to have sex with this person and theoretically want to please them and know their body well enough to do that, but then shrink away when you’re presented with another reality of their body. The fact that, for whatever reason, she thought her vagina was not up to snuff in terms of freshness, and somehow, this is going to send him into a spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb6mw003q3b79uigiv4qb@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; Women are people. I’ve never heard of anyone losing their capacity to see a woman as erotic because of douching, but I think that’s only because most people our age got told really early on, “Do not douche.” But I’ve had male partners who didn’t want to wait until my period was over to have sex, but had to do it with the lights off and the windows open because if they were visually or olfactorily confronted with the reality that there is menstrual fluid, which has a coppery smell. They would be squicked out and disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb93q00403b79gq6rzigg@published"&gt;I’ve also had male partners who are completely fascinated by tampons or menstrual cups, not in an erotic way. There’s nothing arousing about it, but it seems to be the same thing as for me when I saw a male partner shave their face the first few times. There’s that curiosity. The way we teach sex education, even in the areas where people get relatively good sex education, leaves young men severely in the dark about how women’s bodies operate. And I do leave space for the fact that giving birth is pretty traumatic for everyone. So I have a lot of empathy for the men who watch their wife give birth and then are like, “I’ve got a lot to work through.” But these everyday experiences are different.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbblt004a3b79nmgkgijx@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;And that aspect of birth is a documented phenomenon. There are a lot of people who have that reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbd9h004k3b79cxy1l9dn@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so that aside, we’re talking about common, everyday occurrences. When you’re ovulating, the completely healthy fluids coming out of your vulva are sometimes milky or cloudy. Menstrual blood, it’s a thing, it smells like copper, it’s part of having a body. Tampons, they go in, they come out, and they sit in the trash. I mean, it’s aggressive to leave a bloody menstrual cup sitting on the side of the sink where everyone’s toothbrushes are. I can understand how that’s a lot for someone. A tampon in the trash can, that’s another story.&lt;br&gt;It shouldn’t be on the woman to have to manage all of these shocked and grossed-out feelings. It’s like, “I’m sorry. I’m basically an animal with very little body hair.” You’ve got to come to terms with that if you want to have sex with women, marry women, and live with women.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbf7f004u3b79lsoo8pld@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that coming to terms with it is actually the process here. You just kind of have to allow yourself to process these feelings and to understand them and just go through it. It has been two weeks for this guy who saw this thing that traumatized him for whatever reason, so it’s early.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbgz200543b798dkl7f7p@published"&gt;If he walked in on her doing it, she’s aware of that. So if the problem is that he doesn’t want to tell her, but she keeps asking, you can tell her. She may find it strange, confusing, or offensive, but it is the reason, and this is a thing that is beyond you; you’re not controlling this. You can be honest about it. Maybe then she’ll have suggestions or she’ll be able to kind of hold your hand, even if you don’t quite deserve it, and actually help you through it. Or you’ll be on your own. And you know what? Give it a few more weeks, give it a month, and you’ll get horny one day, and that will probably be enough to overcome this issue. You just might need to metabolize this and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbixt005e3b7968qj8qbf@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;When it comes to explaining to the wife what’s going on, the opening of their letter, “I know this sounds insane,” that’s great. Stay in that lane. Own that it is. The writer should own that they are having a reaction that is their problem. They want to let their wife know what’s going on. If the wife offers to be supportive, great. But if at any point the writer frames douching as disgusting or any other facet of just living in a body with internal genitalia and reproductive organs, and the wife leaves them, that is the writer’s fault. If it blows back on you because you’re acting like it’s disgusting to be human, then that’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;

The trial demonstrated that this method of ventilation is safe and “paves the way for future studies to see if this technique can help patients with respiratory failure,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study published on Monday&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enteral ventilation is not meant to replace mechanical ventilators or ECMO, but rather to serve as a complementary oxygenation route,” said Takanori Takebe, &lt;a href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/t/takanori-takebe?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an expert in organoid medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with appointments at both Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the University of Osaka, in an email to 404 Media. The technique proves a backdoor “to provide partial oxygen support while allowing the lungs to rest,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while this method is safe for humans, it hasn’t been experimentally shown to work on patients experiencing respiratory distress yet. If future trials show that enteral ventilation is also effective, it could potentially help newborns and premature infants who are struggling to establish lung function after birth, aid patients with severe respiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), or be applied in other situations in which temporary oxygen supplementation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In such cases, intestinal oxygen delivery could serve as a ‘bridge’ therapy until normal respiration or full ventilatory support can be established,” Takebe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg 996w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;A figure outlining the first enteral ventilation trial in humans.

This initial trial in humans involved 27 healthy male volunteers, who received a liquid called perfluorodecalin through their rectums in an enema-like process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the trial was only intended to determine the safety of the procedure, rather than probe its efficacy in humans, the perfluorodecalin was not oxygenated and none of the volunteers were experiencing any respiratory distress during the course of the study.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results aligned closely with what we had anticipated from our preclinical data,” Takebe said. “We found that intrarectal administration of perfluorodecalin up to 1,000 mL was safe and well tolerated, with only mild and transient gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next phase will involve testing ‘oxygenated’ perfluorodecalin (O₂-PFD) in patients with hypoxemia to evaluate actual oxygen transfer efficacy,” he added. “We are currently planning a Phase II trial in collaboration with clinical partners in Japan and the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takebe and his colleagues were inspired to develop this roundabout route by aquatic species, such as loaches, which absorb oxygen through their intestines to survive in low-oxygen environments. While the idea of rectally administering perfluorodecalin is relatively new, the use of oxygenated liquid for ventilation dates back decades. It even shows up in James Cameron’s 1989 thriller &lt;em&gt;The Abyss&lt;/em&gt;, which includes a real scene of a rat breathing in a tank of liquid perfluorocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique may prove to be an effective means to alleviate respiratory distress in humans, but it’s also inspired its fair share of jokes because, well, it is about butt breath, after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, for instance, Takebe’s team &lt;a href="https://www.tmd.ac.jp/english/news/20240916032859/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;received the Ig Nobel Prize&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a satirical award that honors “achievements so surprising that they make people laugh, then think,” according to its website. Fellow Ig Nobel awardees include a team that &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/tiny-matters/the-ig-nobel-prize-levitating-frogs-constipated-scorpions-and-other-science-that-makes-you-laugh-then-think.html?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;levitated a frog in midair&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and another that investigated why&lt;a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/news/11-hilariously-bizarre-winners-of-the-ig-nobel-prize?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt; pregnant women aren’t constantly tipping over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Receiving the Ig Nobel Prize was both humorous and humbling,” Takebe said. “It was a reminder that truly unconventional ideas often begin at the boundary between curiosity and skepticism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the prize is lighthearted in tone, I do believe it serves a serious purpose, encouraging the public to stay curious and to appreciate how even seemingly odd scientific questions can lead to meaningful innovations,” he concluded. “What began as a playful concept is now moving closer to a viable medical technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"&gt;&lt;p class="kg-callout-emoji"&gt;🌘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-callout-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/signup/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to 404 Media to get &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/tag/the-abstract/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong class="italic"&gt;The Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) as the enzyme that releases energy stored in our fat. Yet patients born without this protein do not become obese: on the contrary, they lose their adipose tissue, developing lipodystrophy with severe metabolic complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team from the Institute of Metabolic and Cardiovascular Diseases (I2MC, Inserm/Université de Toulouse) has just solved this puzzle by discovering that HSL plays a second, unsuspected role in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nucleus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nucleus&lt;/a&gt; of fat cells. The study is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00433-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fat cells, called adipocytes, do more than just store extra weight. They play a key role in managing the body's energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adipocytes accumulate fat in the form of lipid droplets that the body can use when needed—for example, during fasting periods between meals. To do this, the body uses the HSL protein like a kind of switch. When energy is lacking, HSL is activated by hormones such as adrenaline and releases fat to fuel various organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of HSL, one might assume that the energy tap is shut off and that fat would inevitably accumulate. Paradoxically, however, studies in mice and in patients with mutations in the HSL gene show that this does not lead to obesity with excess fat. Quite the opposite happens: the absence of this protein causes a reduction in fat mass, a pathological condition known as lipodystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity and lipodystrophy, though seemingly opposite, share a common point: in both cases, adipocytes malfunction, leading to similar metabolic and cardiovascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To understand this peculiarity, the research team led by Dominique Langin, professor at the University of Toulouse within the I2MC, noticed that HSL was located in an unexpected area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In adipocytes, the protein is known to be on the surface of lipid droplets, where it acts as an enzyme breaking down fat. But the study reveals that it is also present in the nucleus of fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the nucleus of adipocytes, HSL is able to associate with many other proteins and take part in a program that maintains an optimal amount of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adipose+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt; and keeps adipocytes 'healthy,'" explains Jérémy Dufau, co-author of the study, who defended his doctoral thesis on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study shows that the amount of HSL in the nucleus is finely regulated. Adrenaline, which activates the enzyme on the lipid droplet, also promotes its exit from the nucleus. This is what happens during fasting. In a pathological context, the amount of nuclear HSL is increased in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HSL has been known since the 1960s as a fat-mobilizing enzyme. But we now know that it also plays an essential role in the nucleus of adipocytes, where it helps maintain healthy adipose tissue," concludes Langin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new role explains the lipodystrophy observed in patients lacking HSL and opens avenues for a better understanding of metabolic diseases such as obesity and its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery comes at a timely moment. Overweight and obesity affect one in two adults in France. Worldwide, two and a half billion people are affected. Obesity increases the risk of many diseases, including diabetes and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and impairs quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continued research is essential to improve prevention and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patient+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patient care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	This is the first confirmed case of locally acquired terrestrial rabies in a feral cat and the 12th case in wildlife in the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt; As News 12 has reported 11 raccoons tested positive for the virus this year.

	Rabies is a viral disease transmitted from infected mammals to humans. Left untreated, it can lead to death. 

	Early symptoms include irritability, headache, fever, and sometimes itching at the site of exposure. Within days, the disease progresses to paralysis, spasms of the throat muscles, convulsions, delirium, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials are working with the USDA, to conduct a Racoon Rabies Control Program which comprises enhanced surveillance of the raccoon population to identify areas where the disease may be present.

	They're also distributing oral rabies vaccine (ORV) baits in the Towns of Babylon, Huntington, Smithtown, and Islip to prevent the spread of rabies.

	The baits contain a vaccine that, when consumed by a raccoon, will vaccinate the animal against the rabies virus. The goal of the Racoon Rabies Control Program is containment and elimination of terrestrial rabies in local wild animal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:33:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPbG91T0RQR09ZTTZFWTBOVXFRSFBYQnpzYXc3ZlRRS3hybTZIeV9Hc2FlZ0NHa1BWb244Rjl5Z2N3ZHgwbUtHLS1veVd5MTI2UU4wSlBDcDA4LTYyLVpqNHZpeTRGOHphbE0tTHFHR0FWS3B4TXhEM1ozWXQyUC1VcDFFa0hOdTlkTEhHMA</guid></item><item><title>“超级老人”的大脑似乎并不老化，现在科学家说他们知道原因- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/superagers-have-brains-that-dont-seem-to-age-now-scientists-say-they-know-why/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a quarter of a century, researchers have been tracking a rare group of older adults who defy expectations about aging. These “SuperAgers,” all aged 80 or older, seem to have brains that age more slowly while routinely scoring very high on memory tests – as well as people three decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their performance upends the notion that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; is an unavoidable consequence of growing old – and it’s giving scientists a roadmap to protect brain health deep into later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-superagers-brains"&gt;Studying SuperAgers’ brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SuperAging program began in the late 1990s, when neurologist M. Marsel Mesulam coined the term and launched an effort to find out what sets these individuals apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, 290 SuperAgers have enrolled, and 77 have donated their brains for study after death. The research blends years of cognitive testing, personality assessments, and high-resolution imaging with painstaking postmortem analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, researchers noticed a common thread among the living participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are unusually social and outgoing, reporting rich interpersonal networks and frequent engagement with others. But the most startling insights have come from the tissue under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really what we’ve found in their brains that’s been so earth-shattering for us,” said Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences, and neurology at &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-protects-superagers-brains"&gt;What protects SuperAgers’ brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathology tells a nuanced story. Some SuperAger brains show very little buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles the proteins that hallmark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-attacks-the-brain-in-two-separate-phases/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Others carry these lesions but appear unfazed by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,” Weintraub said. “One is resistance: they don’t make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don’t do anything to their brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That “do nothing” is key. In typical aging, higher levels of amyloid and tau correlate with cortical thinning and memory decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SuperAgers, either the proteins are absent, or the brain’s networks seem to withstand their presence without measurable loss in function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This split – resistance versus resilience – could guide both preventive strategies and future treatments for Alzheimer’s and related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-that-stays-decades-younger"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Memory that stays decades younger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, SuperAgers clear a high bar. On a standard delayed word recall test, they score nine or better out of 15, a performance that mirrors average results for people in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference isn’t a fleeting testing trick; it persists year after year in longitudinal follow-up. That consistency allows scientists to distinguish a single lucky test day from a truly exceptional memory profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stronger-cortex-sharper-memory"&gt;Stronger cortex, sharper memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging adds another layer. Unlike typical older adults, SuperAgers do not show the widespread thinning of the cerebral cortex that comes with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some regions they look even more robust than younger people. The anterior cingulate cortex – central to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/optimal-decision-making-is-a-balance-of-experience-and-knowledge/"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;, motivation, and emotional control – often appears thicker in SuperAgers than in adults decades their junior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern hints at why their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/words-like-this-and-that-direct-attention-across-languages/"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt;, motivation, and executive function remain so strong and may contribute directly to memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cells-of-connection-and-strength"&gt;Cells of connection and strength&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the microscope, two cellular details stand out. First, SuperAgers have more von Economo neurons – large, fast-signaling cells linked to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/social-curiosity-starts-young-and-helps-us-survive/"&gt;social behavior&lt;/a&gt; and intuition – than typically aging peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they show larger neurons in the entorhinal cortex, a hub for memory processing that’s among the first brain regions to falter in Alzheimer’s. Both traits suggest a structural and cellular foundation for the resilience seen at the systems level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social theme that emerges in personality measures may not be incidental. More &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Economo_neuron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;von Economo neurons&lt;/a&gt; could be part of the biological substrate underpinning the sociability many SuperAgers report, a behavioral pattern long associated with better cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-memory-before-decline"&gt;Protecting memory before decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and her colleagues see these findings as more than a scientific curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile,” she said. “This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers can mimic the protective features of SuperAger brains – or train the brain to resist or withstand pathology – clinical practice could shift from chasing symptoms to preserving function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may mean new pharmaceuticals aimed at bolstering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/infant-brains-are-more-organized-and-adaptable-than-we-thought/"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle interventions that amplify the brain’s natural “reserve,” or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reframes traditional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;Alzheimer’s research&lt;/a&gt;: rather than asking only how to remove amyloid or tau, scientists can also ask how to make the brain less vulnerable to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-superagers-lasting-legacy"&gt;SuperAgers’ lasting legacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of what we know comes from an extraordinary commitment by participants. SuperAgers are evaluated annually, and many choose to donate their brains for postmortem analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated SuperAgers who were followed for decades,” said neuropsychologist Tamar Gefen, a co-author on the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am constantly amazed by how brain donation can enable discovery long after death, offering a kind of scientific immortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-superagers-sharp-brains-future-health"&gt;SuperAgers, sharp brains, future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now probing why some brains resist pathology while others absorb it without consequence. Are there genetic signatures that predict resilience? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do lifelong habits – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/older-adults-value-social-connection-over-their-own-health/"&gt;social engagement&lt;/a&gt;, aerobic fitness, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, cognitive challenge – interact with biology to produce the SuperAger profile? And can targeted interventions in midlife shift the brain toward the same protective patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 25 years, one message is already clear: cognitive decline isn’t a foregone conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subset of older adults retains memory performance on par with people decades younger, supported by unusual structural, cellular, and pathological profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SuperAgers show that the aging brain can be both tough and flexible – and that translating their biology into prevention could help more of us keep our minds keen well into our 80s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:09:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNakVBY3dDZHdUMVFXalIyaDRtT0dYTHZSNEpOTmhjTERVbXA2aWNEblEwTU0tN25RMDh0aGhQY255WTByZW9Oc0ExM09XaTREcjc3S3Rna0o5UzV4eFdQUkJJRkRiT1dCbWtqbVRDbGxkckhxWVJIUlRzTEZ1NFlhMkZfc3NsSENlNDVHOW5HSVo4allhWVBRVGFmYVhvcXFJMVk2ZHpaR20</guid></item><item><title>您的脖子揭示了您的健康状况-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/what-your-neck-reveals-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;More serious persistent pain can indicate disc herniation, compression of the spinal cord, spinal infection, spinal tumours and infections such as meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Swelling in the neck, accompanied by difficulty swallowing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also linked to the thyroid, this could indicate an iodine deficiency. This condition was once so common among people living in parts of Derbyshire, where &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/healthy-supplements-really/"&gt;iodine&lt;/a&gt; in diets was scarce, that it became known as Derbyshire neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Derbyshire neck is now rare in the UK, thanks to more varied diets and imported foods rich in iodine such as dairy and seafood, iodine deficiency is a growing concern in the UK, particularly among vulnerable groups like pregnant women, women of childbearing age and girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While severe deficiency is rare, studies have shown that mild to moderate deficiency is prevalent as a result of changing dietary habits, such as drinking less milk and a rise in plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Nodes or lumps in the side of the neck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swollen glands in the neck are usually a sign the body is fighting an infection. Swollen glands can be accompanied by flu-like symptoms, a sore throat, a rough rash, scabs and sores, severe muscle aches, nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Swollen glands could suggest sepsis in the mouth or throat, or tonsillitis.” explains Dr Dilkes. “Tongue &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/throat-cancer-guide-larynx-pharynx-signs-symptoms/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is also a possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Bulging vein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bulging, ropey vein in the neck can be a sign of increased pressure in the venous system, and while sometimes harmless, it can also indicate an underlying heart or circulatory problem, such as kidney or liver disease, right-sided heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jugular veins drain blood from the head and neck back to the heart and a bulging jugular vein can indicate that the right side of the heart isn’t pumping efficiently. If this is the case, blood can back-up into these veins, making them appear swollen or pulsating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dilkes explains: “In medical exams, clinicians use the height of the jugular vein as a visible gauge of central venous pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Throbbing lump&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often called a pulsatile mass, a new or enlarged throbbing &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/laryngeal-larynx-cancer-a-comprehensive-guide/"&gt;lump&lt;/a&gt; in the neck that beats in time with your pulse, or is on one side only, could mean an artery has weakened, ballooned or developed an abnormal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rare, a weak, a ballooned area that expands with each heartbeat could rupture (causing an aneurysm) or form a blood clot that travels to the brain, increasing the risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lump could also be a carotid body tumour (paraganglioma), which is a benign growth that develops on the small cluster of nerve tissue next to the carotid artery, a major blood vessel located on the side of the neck. Though usually not life-threatening, it often needs surgery or monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other causes could be trauma-related swelling, an enlarged thyroid artery or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal connection between arteries and veins that can result in death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Alzheimer's Association&lt;/a&gt;, dementia is not a specific disease. Rather, it's an umbrella term for a decline in mental ability that is severe enough to interfere with daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's caused by damage to brain cells, which affects a person's ability to think, remember, and communicate. While &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/woman-throws-away-video-tapes-ex-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; loss is the most well-known symptom, dementia also impacts focus, reasoning, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stage, a person can still be very independent, but may experience noticeable memory lapses. The middle stage is typically the longest, and this is where many of the unfiltered and surreal moments shared in this list can occur. As the disease progresses, social filters can fade, and the part of the brain that says "you probably shouldn't say that out loud" isn't working as it used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533597"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533597" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2148597169-68f8832a74f7d__700.jpg" alt="Young woman and elderly patient with dementia sharing a lighthearted moment while drinking tea on a sofa at home." title="Young woman and elderly patient with dementia sharing a lighthearted moment while drinking tea on a sofa at home."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;When my grandma had dementia she offered to steal a rug for me. “You like this rug?

The curious part is, the comment refers to events from 1865, a time the patient could not possibly have been alive. So, if it’s not a memory, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Bradley Bursack, an elder care consultant, explains that this is called &lt;a href="https://www.agingcare.com/articles/how-to-handle-alzheimers-disease-lying-144204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;confabulation&lt;/a&gt;, a common symptom in mid-to-late-stage dementia. The brain, struggling with significant memory gaps, will essentially create a plausible, though often historically or personally inaccurate, story to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person experiencing confabulation is not lying; they genuinely believe these created memories are true. Their brain's filing system is damaged, so it grabs bits and pieces of information from books, movies, or &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/curiosities/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;historical events&lt;/a&gt; learned long ago and misapplies them to the present reality, leading to these deeply strange and often hilarious moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533681"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533681" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2149232318-68f88749c413a__700.jpg" alt="Young child sitting on an old yellow tractor outdoors, capturing a candid moment related to dementia patient stories." title="Young child sitting on an old yellow tractor outdoors, capturing a candid moment related to dementia patient stories."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;My dementia patient was a farmer.

However, Dr. Andrew E. Budson &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/managing-your-memory/202405/dont-fight-false-memories-in-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that this is often the worst possible approach when dealing with dementia. He says that directly fighting or arguing with a false memory is not only ineffective but can be actively harmful, leading to increased distress for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key, Dr. Budson advises, is to remember that the person genuinely believes their false reality. Arguing with them is like arguing with you about what you had for breakfast; it feels like a personal attack. Instead of correcting, the recommended approach is to "go with the flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge their reality, validate the emotion behind it, and then gently redirect the conversation. The goal is not to win a factual debate but to maintain a positive, trusting connection and ensure your loved one feels safe and understood, even if their reality doesn't match our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533599"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533599" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2150494655-68f8836a56101__700.jpg" alt="Elderly woman reading a book calmly in a cozy home setting, reflecting moments of unfiltered and funny dementia patient quotes." title="Elderly woman reading a book calmly in a cozy home setting, reflecting moments of unfiltered and funny dementia patient quotes."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had one that wanted to teach me how to read.

As explained by the neuro-health company &lt;a href="https://optoceutics.com/weird-strange-odd-things-behaviors-dementia-patients-do/?srsltid=AfmBOoo3DpSFKX6pnRrdHTEept1_xH7WzuBZcFdyDq1zNqVcHS6D_2nx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Optoceutics&lt;/a&gt;, these shifts are a core part of the condition, and there are several common behaviors that can be observed in people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One caregiver shared that their patient constantly believes it's their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/parents-give-thoughtless-gift-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;18th birthday&lt;/a&gt;, a happy memory the brain has decided to joyfully live in on repeat. Another noted that deep-seated prejudices, like racism, simply vanished, as if the part of the brain that held on to that learned negativity had been wiped clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while it can be painful, not recognizing a child can sometimes lead to a sweet new beginning, like the parent who gossips about their kids, to their kids, as if they were new best friends instead!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533609"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533609" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/19092-68f89a650113f__700.jpg" alt="Young male doctor with glasses and stethoscope smiling confidently in a medical office, related to dementia patient care." title="Young male doctor with glasses and stethoscope smiling confidently in a medical office, related to dementia patient care."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;my grandfather had dementia and told my mom he took a trip to China so she asked the nurse about it. the specialist saw him that day and the dr was Chinese.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="www.tiktok.com/@neveah_hstfh/photo/7534856592936717599?cid=NzUzNTA3ODM3MTU1MjAxOTIzMQ" target="_blank"&gt; Mamabear &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/portrait-asian-doctor-white-coat-with-stethoscope-standing-office-smiling-camera_52355423.htm#from_element=cross_selling__photo" target="_blank"&gt; sodawhiskey &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/funniest-dementia-patients-stories-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533612"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533612" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2149370432-68f886b3f2f75__700.jpg" alt="Elderly male patient with dementia in a wheelchair, wearing a green sweater, expressing an unfiltered and funny moment." title="Elderly male patient with dementia in a wheelchair, wearing a green sweater, expressing an unfiltered and funny moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;my grandpa had dementia and he told someone " you dont sweat that much for a fat person " and fully thought it was a compliment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="www.tiktok.com/@neveah_hstfh/photo/7534856592936717599?cid=NzUzNTE0MDM0OTQwMTc2MDU0Mg" target="_blank"&gt; Kris &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/old-patient-suffering-from-parkinson_25177981.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=3&amp;amp;uuid=c5cec629-5811-4245-9dfa-cd1d1fe4dd61&amp;amp;query=grandpa+dementia+patient" target="_blank"&gt; freepik &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/funniest-dementia-patients-stories-10/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a caregiver for someone with dementia is one of the most emotionally and physically demanding roles anyone can undertake.

The stories shared in this list are a perfect example of this principle in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to embrace the surreal humor of a situation rather than fight it, these caregivers are finding a way to connect with their loved ones in the present moment. These flashes of laughter don't erase the heartbreak of the condition, but they are a powerful reminder of the enduring love that shines through, even in the most difficult of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have any hilarious anecdotes to share from your experiences with dementia?

&lt;p&gt;The bat was discovered around 2 p.m. Oct. 16 on the west side of the 500 block of South Main Street, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials urged anyone who touched the bat or saw someone else handle it to call the agency’s Communicable Disease Control Division at 714-834-8180, which operates 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners whose animals may have had contact with the bat should contact their veterinarian, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-fbvgdraj" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_fbvgdraj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal,” the agency said in a statement, adding that preventive treatment is safe and effective if administered promptly after possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency and OC Animal Care offered the following safety tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Avoid contact with wild animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Vaccinate cats and dogs against rabies&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;—Do not sleep with unscreened windows or doors open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Contact animal control if bats are found inside a home or building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Do not leave pet food outside where it could attract wild animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Wash animal bites immediately with soap and water and seek medical care&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;—Report animal bites to OC Animal Care at 714-935-6848&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals, usually by a bite, though rare cases have occurred through contact with the eyes, mouth or an open wound, officials said. Most U.S. human rabies cases in recent years have come from bats, whose small bites can go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
