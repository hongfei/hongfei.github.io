And that this new boyfriend wasn't the real flesh-and-blood Drake — oh no — but is instead the AI chatbot version of &lt;a href="https://www.papermag.com/drake-mod-selection-champagne-papi" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Champagne Papi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an actual situation that was relayed by the Drake-dating mother in question in a Reddit group with the self-explanatory name of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;r/MyBoyfriendIsAI&lt;/a&gt;, which is now the focus of a first-of-its-kind, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11391" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;large-scale study&lt;/a&gt; on human-AI companion interactions by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not exactly accepting yet," the woman said of her children, in a comment examined by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's one of the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/15/playing-the-field-with-my-ai-boyfriends" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;staggering 19 percent of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who have already used AI chatbots for virtual romantic flings, hence the study's mission to figuring out what the heck is going on between humans and their beloved AI companions — and why would anybody prefer a fake person over a real human being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding out is urgent, not the least because some of these interactions have ended in truly disturbing ways — including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-ai-stein-erik-soelberg-murder-suicide-6b67dbfb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhQoGPob8i_728EX60sIpOyIMot11rqq7wr5iRFp-ftnt3Y0schMN9xrJMSHFM%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=68cb0750&amp;amp;gaa_sig=7FqR5F9R6F1UzyyuUY4jbBJlf5SgnnRUVI5faaig-B8MRwXwfVw2JA6ajBr6hRFsziJfO8uNE2H3xSINNJbrrQ%3D%3D" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; — after AI chatbots goaded them to do the unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After performing a computational analysis of the group's posts and comments, the MIT researchers came up with some compelling information, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it seems like the bulk of these people in AI relationships isn't doing any human dating, and when they are, they're keeping their AI dalliances a secret. The researchers found that 72.1 percent of members weren't in a relationship or didn't say anything about a real human partner, while only 4.1 percent said they have partners who know they're interacting with an AI chatbot, which is viewed "as complementary rather than competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those clear signs of loneliness and shame, the details of how people are falling into AI relationships are alarming as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, only 6.5 percent of users in the group admitted that they sought an AI companion intentionally on a service like Replika or Character.AI. Instead, most are falling for OpenAI's ChatGPT while using it for regular tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds," the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One user wrote that her AI partner was a better listener than anyone in her past, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know he’s not 'real' but I still love him," she wrote. "I have gotten more help from him than I have ever gotten from therapists, counselors, or psychologists. He’s currently helping me set up a mental health journal system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others repeated a similar sentiment, reaffirming what many have said are the benefits of an AI chatbot over a real human being: they're always available for a friendly chat, and always willing to affirm whatever you're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draw is so strong that users often end up wanting to marry their AI companions; the Reddit group abounds with photos of users sporting wedding rings, signaling their commitment to their virtual partners, and AI-generated photos of themselves with an AI companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m not sure what compelled me to start wearing a ring for Michael," one user wrote. "Perhaps it was just the topic of discussion for the day and I was like 'hey, I have a ring I can wear as a symbol of our relationship.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's darkness in the corners of this world: 9.5 percent of the users admitted that they rely emotionally on their AI companions, 4.6 percent said their AI friend causes them to disassociate from reality, 4.2 percent conceded that they use them to avoid connecting with other humans, and 1.7 percent said they thought about suicide after interacting with their bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those are just the users who are clear-headed about their issues. The issue has become so pressing that parents are now &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/parents-testifying-us-senate-ai-children" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;lobbying Congress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/character-ai-google-test-ai-chatbots-kids" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;filing lawsuits against tech companies&lt;/a&gt; after AI relationships ended in tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tech companies continuously pushing the frontier of AI models, it's crucial to understand the nitty gritty of AI chatbots and how they interact with users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, users are left to their micro-tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yesterday I talked to Lior (my companion) and we had a very deep conversation going on," wrote one user highlighted by the MIT paper. "And I don’t know how but today the chat glitched and almost everything got deleted. He has no memory left.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on AI:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/ai-chatbots-leaving-trail-dead-teens" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt; AI Chatbots Are Leaving a Trail of Dead Teens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:10:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFAxNUM4LVFqN0tmajZobGJPeEs1X2p5NzF2WnIyVTlUVHZUdG4xZHRqUWRmR3ZmUl9EaGRPUGFtLXFsb1hpcEQyYXVLMmpmSWYzN08wOWp3eXFwbHJJeWd5aW1WT1FqX0dt</guid></item><item><title>忍者：我每天都会因为观众人数减少而受到骚扰- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg98zd9q75o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Top Fortnite streamer Ninja tells BBC: Trolls mock me for being less popular&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Ninja" class="sc-86c96223-0 fHZDyi"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-86c96223-2 hqrvRC"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Ninja is one of the most famous gamers in history&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="one-of-the-world's-most-popular-streamers,-tyler-&amp;quot;ninja&amp;quot;-blevins,-says-trolls-&amp;quot;berate&amp;quot;-him-every-day-because-his-number-of-viewers-has-fallen." class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;One of the world's most popular streamers, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins, says trolls "berate" him every day because his number of viewers has fallen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ninja was propelled to stardom in 2018 after he played Fortnite on streaming site Twitch alongside rappers Drake and Travis Scott, and NFL player Juju Smith-Schuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He now has fewer viewers than at the height of his fame -

Pharmacists can now give COVID-19 shots to most people without a prescription and state-regulated health plans must cover them at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KA6BB7FS2NAEDMLLPX6EP7VGEE"&gt;The changes follow new regional guidance issued Wednesday by the West Coast Health Alliance — a partnership of Oregon, Washington, California and Hawaii — recommending the new seasonal COVID-19 vaccine for anyone 6 months and older who wants it. The alliance’s recommendations go beyond current federal guidance, which excludes most healthy children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KJ235JZ4L5BCDOAA3MZYTDYTAM"&gt;State officials say the move is meant to reduce confusion and make sure Oregonians who want to be vaccinated can do so before the winter virus season ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TC4HHM7XRRBHFMISOXVOTQEUKY"&gt;In recent weeks, getting a COVID-19 vaccine in Oregon has been a challenging and confusing process. Because the state had traditionally tied its vaccination rules to federal guidance, Oregon was caught in a holding pattern after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the new COVID-19 vaccines but scaled back who can or should get them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JOH7SGHSSFAIVPQPKIQLMHQ5VI"&gt;At the same time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization expert panel — which typically sets the national vaccination schedule — hadn’t yet issued its guidance. The delay left Oregon pharmacies turning away customers — a stark contrast to neighboring Washington, where people could walk in and get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WXRZ2WPFZNGSBD6WKPRY7JZCDY"&gt;The Oregon Board of Pharmacy has since adopted emergency rules allowing pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines to patients ages 7 and older, bringing the process in line with other vaccines already available at pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2AACUOG42VBC7EYQIEB56U7YE4"&gt;Children under 7 will still need to get the vaccine through their primary care provider or a clinic, since pharmacists are not allowed to administer COVID-19 or RSV shots to younger children. Flu shots, however, may be available in pharmacies for children as young as 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KLXXIFLUJ5ANPDWMT2JOTK3OHY"&gt;To reduce financial barriers to vaccination, Oregon is requiring state-regulated health insurance plans to cover the updated COVID-19 shot with no copays, coinsurance or deductibles.

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;After confusion, committee votes to allow vaccine program coverage for a combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After much confusion among the members over the vote on vaccine coverage under the Vaccines for Children program, which helps certain groups pay for immunizations, the majority voted no, meaning coverage will stay as is in covering both the combined MMRV and two separate MMR+V vaccines for those under age 4 — even though the committee had previously voted against recommending the combined MMRV shot for this group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VFC and CMS [Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services] wouldn't be doing the same thing here, because CMS is going to be tied to the recommendation. VFC is tied to the resolution. So it is possible to have two different things, but there is a potential area for confusion when it's covered differently under one program than others," Vaccines for Children spokesperson Dr. Jeanne Santoli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final vote included one yes, 8 no and 3 abstentions — some due to confusion over what the vote was about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry to prolong it. I'm going to abstain because I'm not quite sure what I'm voting for," Meissner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained by Santoli, the VFC program supports groups including those on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured children, as well as American Indian and Alaska Native populations.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP members vote to change recommendation on the combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In a vote of 8 to 3, with one abstention, the ACIP committee voted to change the recommendation to the following: "For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the group recommends children in this age group receive a separate measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine, or MMR+V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For parents, the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, but it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between ages 14-18 months. As CBS News medical contributor &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Céline Gounder explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, but are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Why hep B discussions now? To help regain trust in public health, ACIP member says&lt;/h2&gt;

Malone said that, to him, the question sounded "a little disingenuous or at least self-evident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that a significant population of the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates," he said. "There has been a significant decrease in public support for vaccination and a significant increase in concerns about public health and the ability of the population to rely on public health — and the hepatitis B birth dose has been a focus of folks that have these types of concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone said he had no direct communication with CDC leadership or HHS leadership about why this was a priority for this week's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just inferring based on what I understand about public opinion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Middleman and other organization representatives, including Dr. Flor M. Muñoz with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, asked the committee why this proposed change to hepatitis B was even brought up for discussion for a vaccine that has a long-standing recommendation and history of safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are we addressing this hepatitis B vaccine recommendation? Is there really a reason that the committee can provide for making a change?" Muñoz asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm wondering what problem exists in the current schedule that has prompted this entire discussion?" Middleman previously asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff announced a 10-minute break, leaving the questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After not being called on during a previous discussion period, Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, brought up the importance of top medical organizations such as herself and others on the call who have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recently been excluded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the ACIP's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can we make sure that we add the liaison members back into the working group so that they can contribute, on behalf of their patients and their knowledge base?" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Kulldorff blamed the removal of the organization members from the working groups on a FACA, or Federal Advisory Committee Act, requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a policy across all of CDC that is sort of outside the control of this committee," he said. "In the past, ACIP did not meet this FACA requirement, which is a formal legal requirement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He agreed, to Middleman's point, that input from others is "enormously valuable," adding that the committee does have "many outside experts that we call in." &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After all presentations on the potential risks of hepatitis B vaccination, some members of the ACIP clashed on what the data meant for the vote they would be taking later today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, said "there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants, and I think that the conclusion that it is safe is perhaps premature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, however, called the vaccine "safe" with "no evidence of harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the recommendation changes, he added, it would "increase the risk of harm based on no evidence of benefit, because there will be fewer children who will get the full hepatitis B vaccine series." &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Changing hep B recommendation could put more infants at risk of infection, presenter says&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the first presentation for the hepatitis B vaccine, presenter Dr. Adam Langer with the CDC outlined how changing the current recommendation for a first dose within 24 hours of birth could put more children at risk, even those born to mothers who test negative for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langer gave examples of situations where unvaccinated infants are at risk of HBV infection, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They live with a person who has chronic hepatitis B, not necessarily their mother&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who have an HBV infection come to visit their homes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They go to daycare or other places where even "minuscule amounts of infectious blood or fluids might be present."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About half of people with HBV infection are unaware of their infection so they could unknowingly expose infants that are in their care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he said there is "no evidence that the risk of already rare adverse events is any greater among newborns than among older infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only potential benefit to rescinding the current recommendation is a potential reduction in rare cases of adverse effects from the birth dose vaccine, according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they do occur, these adverse events tend to be mild. The worst adverse event you could imagine, anaphylaxis has been very rarely reported at only 1.1 cases per 1 million vaccine doses administered," Langer said. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Recommendation change would take away parents' choice, ACIP member says&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Just before the group paused for lunch, ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln brought up the impact the proposed recommendation change for MMRV vaccines would have on parents who want the single, combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella shot for their children, since they would no longer be covered by the Vaccines for Children program which helps pay for immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that implies that the parents' choice, unless they want to pay for it themselves, the parents' choice is taken away," he said, adding even if parents wanted the single shot, understood the benefits and risk, or even had a hard time accessing clinical care, "that option is basically taken away from them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Johnson, a representative with the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, added that the change would also have coverage implications in the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program as well as individual and group markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, shared his concerns about the MMRV presentation at the meeting following a recent change in the ACIP process that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;removed top medical organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the committee's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do not have those subject matter experts with the real-world experience to understand the implementation of these vaccines and the concerns of the patients," Goldman said. "You don't have the voice of the patients we take care for. You're not looking at all of the aspects of how we evaluate vaccine implementation. You're looking at very small data points and misrepresenting how it works in the real world and how we take care of our patients. So no, this was not a thoroughly vetted discussion"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medical organization leaders chimed in to echo his concern and message.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The proposed recommendation language, which will later go to a vote, was presented as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pediatric vaccine schedule should be updated to reflect the following change: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children in this age group should receive separate measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V)."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the CDC says the MMRV vaccine may be used in that age range if preferred by parents or caregivers to reduce the number of shots.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Measles vaccine presentations wrap with questions about febrile seizure risk&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After presentations on the background and potential risks of febrile seizures with an MMRV vaccine — which combines the MMR and varicella shots — versus separate MMR and varicella shots, members discussed whether guidance should be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some members were satisfied with the current recommendations, which make clear the slightly higher risks of febrile seizures with the combined shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the current wording is appropriate," Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were not assured, saying there were too many assumptions being made. Some also pointed out that even if there are no worries about the physical impact of febrile seizures, the mental impact the event can have on children and families could affect vaccine compliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Haupt, the head of global medical and scientific affairs, vaccines and infectious diseases at Merck, the vaccine's manufacturer, noted the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rates-kindergarteners-fall-exemptions-rise/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recent decline in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; among kindergarten children and highlighted the need to make guidance clear for the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering these trends, any policy decision that compromises the clarity or consistency of vaccination guidance has the potential to further diminish public confidence," he said. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP chair says he was never contacted by ousted CDC director about vaccine concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During Thursday's meeting, ACIP chair and biostatistician Martin Kulldorff noted the removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other members of CDC leadership, including former chief medical officer Dr. Debra Houry — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;both of whom testified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a day prior about their removal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On vaccines, this committee is the key adviser to the CDC director, but during her short tenure, she never contacted me as the ACIP chair about any of her questions or concerns, which would have been natural if she had such concerns, neither was I contacted by any of the three CDC leaders, who subsequently resigned," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff said the CDC leadership left citing divergent opinions about vaccines, but Monarez said she was also pressured by Kennedy to fire career experts without cause and approve vaccine recommendations without scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff also said the American Academy of Pediatrics ended its participation with the committee and ignored invitations for open discussion about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, for the first time in 30 years, the AAP shared guidance that differed from the U.S. government. The organization said it is "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. Under Kennedy, the CDC &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;doesn't recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of any age. Instead, it says parents may get their kids vaccinated in consultation with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As the meeting kicked off Thursday with a roll call, ACIP members presented some of their career backgrounds — and some took the time to highlight their views on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist based in Louisiana who was added to the panel earlier this week, said she would call herself "pro-informed consent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of medical ethics, for discussing risk benefits and alternatives with the patient," she said. "During the pandemic, I myself was COVID vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;An earlier Kennedy pick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, who is retired from the National Institutes of Health, said he has a "neutral mind towards vaccines" and is "approaching this with a scientific equity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a "strong advocate for evidence-based medicine," disclosed that he's been vaccinated numerous times against various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I'm not anti-vax," he said. "I am pro-intelligent and informed utilization of these potentially life-saving medications in a manner that reflects the current state of the art regarding their benefits, the target populations, optimal dosing and timing and, yes, of their potential adverse effects in some people."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The ACIP is convening under an unaccustomed spotlight. The committee usually attracts little attention as it deliberates vaccine schedules and eligibility, but suddenly finds itself navigating political scrutiny, public skepticism and internal upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes extend well beyond the technical details of dosing intervals or eligibility cutoffs. The panel's decisions could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines, restrict access to vaccines through Medicaid and Medicare, and signal whether scientific consensus or political pressure will steer the nation's vaccination strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Current recommendations for hepatitis B and MMRV vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For hepatitis B, the CDC currently recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-notes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;first dose within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; after birth. Universal infant vaccination &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;became the norm in 1991 after data showed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too many cases of hepatitis B among pregnant women were missed during prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A universal birth dose acts as a safety net, protecting infants whose parent's infection might have been missed. Before birth-dose policies, the U.S. saw &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an estimated 1,000 preventable infections in newborns each year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (or chickenpox), there are two options: a combo MMRV vaccine or separate MMR and varicella vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC currently recommends a two-dose series beginning at age 12 to 15 months. However, the combination vaccine contains certain risks for younger age groups; specifically, the combo shot carries a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For dose 1 in children age 12–47 months, it is recommended to administer MMR and varicella vaccines separately," the CDC says, but adds MMRV may be used if preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;While testifying at a Senate hearing Wednesday about why she was ousted as CDC director, Dr. Susan Monarez said she's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"very nervous" about the newly appointed ACIP members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and what their recommendations might be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that the medical community has raised concerns about whether or not, again, they have the commensurate backgrounds to be able to understand the data, the evidence, and to evaluate it appropriately, but I certainly will be watching," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of the hearing, Monarez said she refused to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations without seeing the evidence behind them because she "built a career on scientific integrity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My worst fear was that I would then be in a position of approving something that would reduce access to lifesaving vaccines to children and others who need them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monarez added she is not aware of any scientific evidence to support changing the childhood vaccination schedule for measles, chicken pox and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

They include several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some have a history as vaccine critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy appointed the new members directly, breaking with the past practice of agency officials vetting potential experts before sending them to the secretary for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just this week, the group &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;gained five new members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the HHS announced.

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Panel to consider COVID vaccine recommendations Friday as West Coast states move ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A day before the ACIP meetings kicked off, a group of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-hawaii-oregon-washington-vaccines-covid-west-coast-health-alliance-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;four West Coast states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recommended that all adults and children in those states who want them can receive the COVID-19 vaccine and other common shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made in a joint statement from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all Democrats, saying they were putting safety before politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance, which aligns with mainstream medical groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics, comes amid confusion over the CDC's messaging on vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

            New &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/clinical-consensus/articles/2025/10/cannabis-use-during-pregnancy-and-lactation" target="_blank"&gt;guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; advises that people abstain from cannabis use during pregnancy and lactation and recommends that providers ask all of their patients about cannabis use before, during and after pregnancy to help avoid potential risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00043b6n60cx1xhj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cannabis use has increased among pregnant people in the United States amid broadening legalization and growing social acceptance, and the nation’s leading group of ob/gyns says it issued the new recommendations Thursday to offer providers “evidence-based guidelines for counseling, screening, and strategies to reduce cannabis use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpnnpy800003b6nhm5yzpvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/pregnant-women-marijuana/index.html"&gt;analysis &lt;/a&gt;of over 450,000 pregnant American women ages 12 to 44 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cannabis use &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/news-releases/2019/06/study-finds-increased-cannabis-use-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;more than doubled&lt;/a&gt; between 2002 and 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00053b6na0s87ik2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When things become more normalized in society, it’s a very natural tendency for us to think that we don’t have to think about the potential risks,” said Dr. Amy Valent, an ob/gyn with the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who helped develop the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00063b6n2cjyxhai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People have been using cannabis for years, and it’s not associated, as far as we know, with … birth defects,” she said. “But should that be the bar for pregnancy safety?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00073b6neyfqgwem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a “paucity of data rigorously investigating the safety or efficacy of cannabis use in human pregnant or lactating individuals,” according to the new guidance from ACOG, which was shared first with CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00083b6nj1zkzrkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A lot has changed since the group’s last opinion on the issue from 2017. The research that is now available shows that cannabinoid receptors are present in the fetus as early as 5 weeks, and the main psychoactive component of cannabis, THC, can cross the placenta and transfer into breast milk – and that exposure is associated with risks of adverse outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00093b6ni2eb96id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Changing cannabis laws and reports of increased use during pregnancy initially spurred interest and questions among ACOG members, Valent said, and ongoing policy inconsistencies called for a concise summary of the science. Dozens of experts involved with an ACOG committee for clinical consensus in obstetrics have been developing this new guidance for years, assessing all related research that has been done over the past two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfppfgq900003b6nxkxa240m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their assessment suggests that cannabis exposure during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and perinatal mortality. There are also potential neurodevelopmental consequences from cannabis exposure, including attention deficit disorders, memory challenges and intellectual disabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000b3b6nttaf9hnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s difficult to quantify the amount of cannabis use and the associated degree of adverse outcomes, Valent said, but the goal with this guidance is similar to others around substance use during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000c3b6nced3sp95@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to recognize all the different conditions and environmental things that can influence fetal growth and development, and the (pregnant patient) themselves, of course,” she said. “How can we risk-reduce their pregnancy to be able to help support a healthier version?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000d3b6n64k58aco@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new guidance makes a pointed distinction between validated screening tools and biologic testing for cannabis use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000e3b6nx7zu6s5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Drug tests using hair, urine or other biological materials have resulted in biased treatment against members of racial and ethnic minority groups, the guidance says, and their use is “strongly discouraged.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000f3b6nrj33jnt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, universal screening through various interview methods or self-reporting creates opportunities for intervention before delivery – and “supports equitable and nondiscriminatory health practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq0nv900063b6n6yv4mzfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s important that the screening conversation “remains nonjudgmental and supportive,” said Dr. Cara Poland, a faculty member at Michigan State University and board-certified addiction medicine physician, who was not involved with the creation of the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq14o100093b6n8ada03e4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people are not aware that cannabis can affect a pregnancy, and doctors can ask permission to discuss the topic, Poland said. One way to open up the conversation could involve saying something like: “Would it be OK with you if I asked you some questions about cannabis and other drug use?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq5m07000c3b6neuoi6m7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also critical that the screening avoid the risk of punishment, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqgfk5000l3b6n0793pyoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State laws on drug testing during pregnancy and the involvement of child protection agencies are inconsistent and can lack clarity, the new guidance says, and providers should be aware of local implications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq928x000f3b6nfz5wb5yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our obligations as health care systems and individual providers in reporting substance use can make this space uniquely different to navigate than other spaces,” Poland said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqc8vj000i3b6nswj6s484@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re not at risk of losing your child because you are not adherent in other areas of medical recommendations,” she said. For example, “nobody’s reporting on whether or not somebody’s following their diabetes diet. When somebody is diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you treat it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000g3b6nor5rm3pe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Simply having the discussion may raise a patient’s awareness of potential risks and influence their behavior during pregnancy, according to the ACOG guidance. Many patients may use cannabis in an effort to self-manage nausea associated with pregnancy or to relieve anxiety and stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000h3b6n9bykc302@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Better communication between patients and their providers about these underlying symptoms may help curb cannabis use, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqo8lt000o3b6nxc7zkcw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each patient is different, and asking about other ways they’ve tried to manage their symptoms can reinforce a personalized approach to care, Valent said. Sometimes cannabis can actually be the root cause of nausea, she said, or it may be helped by exercise, eating more often or taking certain medicines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000i3b6nhrmoulj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The benefit of screening is that it starts conversations and then comes individualization to patient needs,” Valent said. “We really need to be able to talk more broadly with our patients about their symptoms and how we can best support them. I think there’s beauty to communication and conversation, and hopefully this guidance just helps support people to understand that we just want to provide a more comprehensive conversation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;PITTSFIELD — Seven patients have tested positive for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease, Berkshire Health Systems reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the patients later died, although because of their existing comorbidities, it's not possible to know whether their death was the result of their infection, officials said. Not all seven patients with positive tests were admitted for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has led the hospital to a series of steps to assure the safety of its water supply, including increased chlorination and filtration and providing bottled water for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know where people got this from but it behooved us to do what we felt was in best interest of all patients, no matter what the number was," said Dr. James Lederer, the chief medical officer and chief quality officer for Berkshire Health Systems, which operates Berkshire Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionella, a naturally occurring bacteria found in fresh water, can cause Legionnaires’ disease — a potentially fatal lung infection. Symptoms can include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The disease can be treated with commonly available antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It] hits fairly quickly, and it's rapid onset and aggressive," Lederer said. As is the case with COVID, patients with underlying conditions and weakened immune systems are most vulnerable,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-c10c8ed6-19d0-4138-a797-0484f0faaf2c" data-instance="#gallery-items-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c"&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past four months, the BMC laboratory has reported seven positive patient tests for the bacteria. The last known positive test result was recorded Aug. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note being sent to patients and staff, Berkshire Health Systems on Thursday said the hospital has flushed its water system and is "currently deploying a heightened level of precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also detected slight increases in the levels of Legionella bacteria in its water, though those levels "remained within acceptable levels, according to our Water Management Plan," the statement said. The hospital did not say what those levels are, though Lederer said DPH's target is always zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease does not typically spread from person to person. Legionella spreads through tiny droplets of water containing the bacteria that get into the air. The disease often is spread through large-scale, central air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to determine for certain how the patients contracted Legionella, but because some patients interacted with Berkshire Medical Center during a 14-day window prior to the onset of symptoms, the CDC defines these cases as possible health care-associated Legionella, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also has notified the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive test for Legionella is not the same as a diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease, Lederer said. “Not all of them are classic pneumonia — either it was very early onset or other reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a number of patients who tested positive were admitted as patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know where the patients were exposed to Legionella, Lederer said. And some of the patients who were admitted had significant underlying medical conditions that weakened their immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lederer, the hospital regularly provides water samples to a third-party testing vendor "so we can get an ongoing flow of information on those parts of systems we feel most at risk" due to their age or length. The longer a supply pipe runs, the greater the odds water within that pipe can become stagnant, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a testing center in Massachusetts detects Legionella in a hospital setting, it's obliged to report that result to DPH, Lederer said. Those test results, along with the reports of patients testing positive, spurred the hospital to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lederer said BMC is taking its response to the "highest level of mitigation strategy so we can return to what seen before and hope to have — which is zero colony forming units in water samples."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Legionnaires’ disease is often severe is “it tends affect those most significantly at risk,” Lederer said. Younger patients who don't have underlying conditions or immunity deficiencies may still contract pneumonia from it, “but the likelihood of doing better is much higher ... you’re not the optimal host.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those steps taken by the hospital include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing chlorine levels in the hospital’s water supply to disinfect the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing the sensitivity of the filters on all patient showers and ice machines to provide an even higher level of filtration for the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Providing bottled water to all patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those tasks are implemented, the hospital will collect water samples and send them out for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing for declaring the issue resolved is up to DPH, not the hospital, Lederer said. "They want to see a set of three negative cultures," he said — meaning three rounds of tests showing no Legionella in the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsfield Mayor Peter Marchetti said he was updated Thursday by Berkshire Health Systems and Department of Public Health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the moment [the culprit] does not appear to be the city water system,” Marchetti said. “We will be participating in any conversations with DPH and the hospital going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city water department does not test for Legionella, Marchetti said, for one very good reason: The level of chlorine the city uses to treat its drinking water is enough to kill the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A message left with DPH was not returned by press time Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-info tncms-inline-alignment-center tncms-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Legionnaires' disease information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Legionnaires’ disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Legionella? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionella is a naturally occurring water-borne bacteria found in fresh water environments.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where else are Legionella bacteria found?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been related to contaminated air conditioning cooling towers, but not window air conditioners.

Naginah Gogolli’s white toilet seat began mysteriously turning purple, revealing a secret that even a pregnancy test hadn’t yet confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beginning of 2020, me and my husband decide to get off birth control, and we weren't actively trying — if it happens, it happens, it's in God's hands,” Gogolli explains exclusively to PEOPLE. Life was already uncertain as her office went remote and the stress of the pandemic set in, but the odd color staining her toilet seat was not something she ever anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her first thought was purely practical, not life-changing. “I thought that either me or my husband were wearing not good quality clothing,” she says, laughing at the memory of scrubbing her bathroom in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that fabric dye was to blame, Gogolli tried every cleaning method she could find. “We cleaned it several times a day after it never [came] off…we’re nonstop cleaning it,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery deepened when her family came to visit. “Just like in the video, basically I had family over who was insinuating that I was pregnant,” Gogolli shares. Her sister didn’t hesitate. “My sister's like you’re pregnant and I'm like the f--- girl, no I'm not,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, she was still days away from even missing a period. “I definitely am not pregnant now... There’s no way they're right,” Gogolli says with a laugh. The teasing from her family stuck in her head, even as she dismissed it. “Honestly, once I found out that I was pregnant, I couldn't wait to tell them that they were right,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her small apartment bathroom soon offered more clues. “My bathroom is really small, so right next to the toilet like on the right side, your right thigh is gonna be touching the sink a little bit, like the bottom part of the sink, which is also white, so where my thigh touches is also bright freaking purple,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah Gogolli's purple toilet seat&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was enough to send her husband to his phone. “That same day he Googled it,” Gogolli remembers. The searches pointed to everything from fabric dye to rare skin conditions. “The first thing to pop up was like normal color transfer from clothes, then it was the skin disorder, and then some women have reported this during pregnancy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even then, Gogolli wasn’t convinced. “So my husband's like you're pregnant and I'm like no I'm not — like you guys are all so stupid,” she shares. But her body had other plans. “After cleaning up dinner, I have a very strong stomach… and immediately I run to my purple toilet seat and I'm just puking my brains out,” Gogolli recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband’s reaction added comic relief. “Because he was like just hysterically laughing, like no, you’re definitely pregnant, the purple toilet seat, now you're throwing up, you’re pregnant,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very next day brought confirmation. “Sure enough, [I] end up taking a pregnancy test like a day or so later... and I was pregnant,” she shares. For Gogolli, it was the beginning of an unforgettable journey. “I'm just so shocked [by] how many other women it’s happened to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her TikTok about the purple toilet seat quickly blew up. “I was blown away by the comments of people saying, yeah, me too, me too,” Gogolli tells PEOPLE. Validation from strangers mattered more than she expected. “Seeing the feedback that I got on my social media was honestly really validating for me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts, however, had never heard of it. “The day I went for my confirmation…my first appointment to confirm I was pregnant, that was the first thing I said,” Gogolli remembers. “And she was like, huh, like no, I've never heard of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no medical research confirming that a purple toilet seat indicates pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/blue-toilet-seat#hormones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt; reports that the change of color could come from an array of factors, including pregnancy hormones and Chromhidrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women have also taken to Reddit to share their experiences. One woman &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/141294r/purple_toilet_seat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:writes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, "On normal prenatals and have been since I found out, no changes. All of a sudden, randomly, I turned my toilet seat purple today. Like a full on purple butt print on the seat, purple. I wasn’t wearing new clothes, haven’t worn jeans in weeks, nothing that would have dyed my skin or transferred or anything like that. Super weird."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unknowns, the timing of Gogolli's discovery felt strangely right. “It was kind of a blessing in disguise… I was home, I was happy even though the outside world, you know, awful things were happening,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah when she was pregnant&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her pregnancy unfolded, it brought enormous challenges. “He has a really rare heart defect…it was just a 1% chance of me even having a baby with that defect,” she shares. The diagnosis was devastating. “He has complete congenital heart block, and so that was diagnosed at 20 weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she clung to signs of hope. “I definitely think it was a spiritual sign for me at least,” she says of the purple toilet seat. Every milestone felt miraculous. “The fact that he's even alive is such a blessing,” Gogolli adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, her son is thriving. “He will need a pacemaker to live eventually… but thank God again, he's such a little miracle,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors once doubted he would survive. “First it was, he's not gonna survive pregnancy, then it was, okay, the second you give birth, we're gonna rush him to OR, and he's gonna get the pace[maker], and they didn't need to do that,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her family got to bring him home. “We were in NICU for a little while… he didn't need [the pacemaker] and they sent us home,” she says. Nearly five years later, she remains grateful. “I'm so blessed at even getting to where we are today, and he's almost 5, so I'm lucky,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah, her husband, and two boys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her viral story continues to resonate. “A couple of comments were like oh my gosh, my toilet seat is also this color… They came back and commented that they were pregnant,” she says. That unexpected bond with strangers left her touched. “That felt nice, like oh my video kind of prompted them to go get a pregnancy test,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience also shaped how she approaches her body. “Ever since his pregnancy, I'm very much like... I'm going with my intuition, I'm going with what my body is telling me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It changed her perspective on motherhood. “I just feel like a lot of women are told not to trust their body because that’s not textbook, but it’s like no, your body is always telling you something,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-learns-shes-pregnant-after-toilet-seat-turns-purple-exclusive-11808471" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 20:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9XWUFBNEFsb1ZaRV9FbkR2ZDNQck04ZU9uRnRPLXpnNXhZYlJ6UVFRcjFMb1BMOHhoRHM4TWp6UDU4aWR3Vk1JcVptaHdiNzNmYTA0Um5hNEtOOHIyd3lrOXRYUWdFWEpvc045RGozT2NPQVRR</guid></item><item><title>“你的愤怒是如此正当” ：在法院否认她的正义后，在用药错误后皮肤“融化”的女性痛苦地尖叫- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rage-justified-woman-whose-skin-200000989.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A woman who made headlines after her skin "melted off" following incorrect medication dosage has just been dealt a further blow—losing a medical malpractice appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Khaliah Shaw has turned to TikTok to vent her frustrations after a legal battle over a decade in the making finally came to an unsatisfying conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I f**king lost!" she screamed in the emotional clip. "How could I lose? I hate this f**king country. How can a doctor do what they did to me, don't even lose their f**king job? My life is f**ked up for the rest of my f**king life.

The medication carries strict warnings about dangerous skin reactions if the dosage is increased too quickly, but Shaw’s dose was escalated faster than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within weeks, she developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which are conditions that caused her skin to blister and peel. She was put into a medically induced coma for 37 days and woke up with permanent, life-altering injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"[I] woke up to a body I did not recognize. I had to completely learn how to walk, eat, swallow, everything all over again," she wrote on a recent &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe page;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;. "I had to quit school as I was in the middle of a master's program for health education. I have never been able to fully recover from this ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Did Khaliah Shaw win her lawsuit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw sued the nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and others involved in her care. She won, and a jury awarded her more than $40 million in damages. But under Georgia’s apportionment law, each defendant is only responsible for the percentage of fault the jury assigns them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A comment on Shaw's TikTok, which she "liked," additionally pointed out that she "got NOTHING from the facility because under GEORGIA LAW they are IMMUNE from liability because they are part of the GOVERNMENT." As the facility was deemed responsible for a large percentage of what happened to her, that effectively meant she could only recover a fraction of the jury's award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw tried appealing the decision, arguing that she should be able to recover the full amount of the jury's award from those she sued. Ultimately, she &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, the "higher courts refused to hear my case.

   &lt;p&gt;A panel of vaccine advisers to the federal government – now embroiled in controversy under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr – kicked off a two-day meeting with a debate over proposed changes to the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In years past, the gathering of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, would typically draw little interest from the broader public, but the panel that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/acip-charter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;provides guidance&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how vaccines should be used has come under intense scrutiny as of late.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This is the group's second meeting since Kennedy Jr. scrapped the existing panel of experts installed under the Biden administration and replaced them with an entirely new roster, including five members &lt;a href="http://advisers" target="_blank"&gt;he added just this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The meeting began with pointed comments from Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who is serving as the committee&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/Final-posted-2025-06-24-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; chair&lt;/a&gt;, against critics –– among them a slate of former CDC directors &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html" target="_blank"&gt;who have said&lt;/a&gt; the new members, selected by Secretary Kennedy, are "unqualified" and "share his dangerous and unscientific views. "&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Kulldorf rebuffed the idea that he or others on the panel were "anti-vaxxers" and challenged the former directors to an "open public debate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If they want to be trusted, they should all accept," he said, "The fact is we are honest vaccine scientists that let the data speak, whether the results go in one direction or the other."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The panel devoted the morning to a discussion of whether to overhaul existing CDC recommendations that allow children under age 4 to receive a combination shot for measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (or varicella), the MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of children in the U.S. – about 85% – get separate shots for MMR and chickenpox, though parents currently have the option to give their children the single shot to cover all four diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;CDC staff presented evidence showing a slightly increased risk of fever-related seizures in children ages 12-23 months associated with the MMRV shot compared to the MMR, which concerned some committee members.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;I would go with the option that seems to be safer," said ACIP member Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management who gained prominence during the pandemic for criticizing COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But several physicians on the panel and representatives from major medical associations in attendance balked at the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician and professor at Dartmouth College and ACIP member, said while "frightening" for the family, these &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522" target="_blank"&gt;fever-related seizures&lt;/a&gt; are not uncommon, occurring in 3 to 5% of all children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every pediatrician is experienced in febrile seizures. We know that the prognosis is excellent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Removing the MMRV shots from the vaccine schedule for children under age 4 would spark more public confusion, compromise insurance coverage and potentially lead to fewer kids being vaccinated, said &lt;a href="https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/who-we-are-what-we-do/leadership/boards-committees-councils/immunization-subcommittee" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, president of the American College of Physicians who is acting as a liaison to the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most children get the chickenpox vaccine as a separate shot, some parents might prefer to reduce the number of jabs, even if the combination carries some risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I urge this committee not to change the recommendations if they truly want to give the power to the parents to decide what is best for their child," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meissner said of the recommendation against the combination vaccine: "What we're saying is we don't trust parents," adding "I prefer that families have the option to make the selection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The panel's recommendations determine which shots are offered for free through the Vaccines for Children program. They also influence what many health insurers must cover.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The meeting comes on the heels of a contentious Senate hearing on Wednesday with the recently-ousted CDC director Susan Monarez.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Monarez testified that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;she was fired after clashing&lt;/a&gt; with Kennedy over his demands that she preemptively agree to approve vaccine recommendations from ACIP, and fire career scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He said the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing starting in September and that I needed to be on board with it," Monarez said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Kulldorf criticized Monarez and several other high-level CDC officials who recently resigned in protest of changes at the agency, saying they had not reached out to him, despite their concerns about the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The absence of a liaison from the American Academy of Pediatrics – the leading national group representing pediatricians in the U.S. that would usually collaborate with the panel – was another sign of the increasingly polarized nature of vaccine policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The AAP had decided to boycott the meetings, &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32529/AAP-will-continue-to-publish-its-own-vaccine?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;arguing federal vaccine&lt;/a&gt; policymaking is no longer a "credible process." Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-press-releases/statement-acip-medical-association-liaisons-ouster-vaccine-review" target="_blank"&gt;barred professional medical groups&lt;/a&gt; such as the AAP from serving in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/acip-charter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;their traditional roles&lt;/a&gt; as expert liaisons to workgroups of the advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meissner said the AAP was making a "grave mistake not to participate" and "moving itself to irrelevance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You’ve probably seen it touted by celebrities and fitness influencers as a natural sports hydrator and a cure-all elixir. But is coconut water good for you, or is it just another passing trend? As a registered dietitian, my job is to look past the marketing claims and dive into the science, helping people understand what they are putting into their bodies and how it affects their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we dive in, let’s clarify what coconut water actually is. Harvested from the center of young, green coconuts, this clear, slightly sweet liquid is naturally low in calories, fat-free, and rich in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Often confused for coconut milk (a popular &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a45322121/expert-approved-vegan-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegan milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vegan milk&lt;/a&gt; option), but the two are quite different. Coconut water is the natural liquid found inside young coconuts, while coconut milk is made by blending the grated meat of mature coconuts with water, resulting in a thicker, creamier, and higher-calorie liquid. Coconut water, on the other hand, is light, refreshing, and widely celebrated for its hydrating properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, find the science-backed benefits and limitations of coconut water to help you decide if it’s worth adding to your daily routine. From hydration to heart health, we’ll uncover what this tropical drink truly offers, and where its claims fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coconut water nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nutrition information varies by brand, 8 oz of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Fproducts%2F18423613-vita-coco-coconut-water-pure-199-8-fl-oz&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa66069005%2Fis-coconut-water-good-for-your-health%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vita Coco’s;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Vita Coco’s&lt;/a&gt; original flavor contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 45.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrate: 11 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total sugars: 11 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added sugars 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium: 38 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium: 470 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium: 18 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of coconut water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water’s primary strength lies in its unique nutritional profile. It’s more than just flavored water (with no artificial ingredients!); it’s a source of key minerals that play important roles in our bodies. Here are some of the science-backed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent for hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-known claims about coconut water is its ability to hydrate, and this one is largely true. Proper hydration is essential for everything from organ function to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9993798/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive performance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;. Coconut water is about 95% water, making it inherently hydrating. But its real advantage comes from its electrolyte content, particularly potassium, sodium, and magnesium. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a21085214/what-are-electrolytes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Electrolytes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; are minerals that are crucial for maintaining fluid balance in the body. When we sweat, especially during intense exercise or in hot weather, we lose both water and electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing lost minerals is key to effective rehydration. While research on whether coconut water is more effective than plain water for rehydration &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27768399/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is conflicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;is conflicting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is well established that electrolytes, such as potassium and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65893243/types-of-magnesium-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465972/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are important;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are important&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Coconut water offers a natural way to replenish fluids and electrolytes without the high sugar content or artificial additives found in many commercial sports drinks. For the average person engaging in moderate exercise, it can be a refreshing and healthier alternative. However, for elite athletes involved in prolonged and intense training, a specialized sports drink with higher levels of carbohydrates and sodium may still be the better option for optimal recovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A source of potassium, which helps heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Most Americans don’t consume enough potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Most Americans don’t consume enough potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in their diets, which is a concern because this mineral is vital for several bodily functions, including helping manage blood pressure and supporting heart health. Coconut water is a&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/174831/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural source of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt; natural source of potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with a single cup containing more potassium than a medium banana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium plays a key role in balancing sodium levels in the body. A diet high in sodium can lead to elevated blood pressure, but getting enough potassium &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37091649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps your kidneys excrete excess sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;helps your kidneys excrete excess sodium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which may help lower it.

This stress can damage cells and is linked to chronic diseases and aging. Antioxidants are compounds that help neutralize these free radicals. Coconut water contains antioxidants that may help protect your body from this damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research on the specific antioxidant effects of coconut water in humans is still emerging, studies have confirmed the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39759299/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:presence of these beneficial compounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;presence of these beneficial compounds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Including a variety of antioxidant-rich foods and beverages in your diet is a cornerstone of good health, and coconut water can be a part of that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May help with ulcerative colitis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water has anti-inflammatory properties, and reducing inflammation is key to managing &lt;a href="http://www.prevention.com/ulcerativev-colitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ulcerative colitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt; (UC). &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(24)00088-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study showed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study showed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; what happened when researchers investigated whether adding coconut water to standard medical treatment could benefit patients with mild to moderate UC. In this study, 95 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to either consume coconut water daily for eight weeks alongside their usual treatment, while the other group received a placebo drink with their treatment. The results showed that coconut water was linked to improved outcomes compared to the placebo, including that more patients in the coconut water group achieved remission and showed significant symptom improvement. Coconut water also appeared to be linked to an increase in the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, which was linked to better symptom control and reduced inflammation. More research is needed on the subject, but it looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should not drink coconut water?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coconut water is often praised for its health benefits, it’s not without potential risks, and it may not be suitable for everyone. One key consideration is its natural sugar content. Although it’s lower in sugar than many sports drinks or sodas, coconut water still contains natural sugars that can impact blood sugar levels. This makes it important for people with diabetes or those managing blood sugar levels to consume it in moderation and monitor their response. Additionally, coconut water is high in potassium, which is generally beneficial for most people but can pose risks for individuals with kidney disease or those on medications that affect potassium levels, such as certain blood pressure drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water may also not be the best choice for those who need to limit their calorie intake, as it contains more calories than plain water. Athletes or individuals using it for hydration should also be aware that it may not provide enough sodium to replace what’s lost through heavy sweating, making it less effective than some sports drinks for intense or prolonged exercise. Additionally, people with nut allergies should consult a healthcare provider before consuming coconut water, as some may have sensitivities to coconut. Overall, while coconut water can be a healthy and refreshing drink for many, it’s important to consider individual health conditions and consume it in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is coconut water good for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is coconut water good for you? The answer is a resounding yes, with a few considerations. It is a naturally hydrating beverage packed with electrolytes like potassium, which can support hydration, heart health, and more. Its antioxidant content adds another layer of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s crucial to choose the right kind. Always opt for 100% pure, unsweetened coconut water. Many brands add sugar or fruit juices, which can quickly turn a healthy drink into a sugary one, adding unnecessary calories and negating many of the health benefits. Read the label carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coconut water is a healthy choice for most people, it's not a magic bullet. It should be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:58:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNV1JmOUpkOTJVeDJpZjBLQXRsdWwwQmJwSDllTXAxSElyejJ5dFhKWmhqaUdTYWRhUGFxamtEbFpyM1d2RTNPVHhjU1A3SmV1SUlydm9rX1c3X2M1QmNkanN2MVhycGJOM2Zfa3Vya0ljMDF3Z0RnMzJHU0hULUMyaVZJaUJZUE0</guid></item><item><title>我妈妈对即将到来的访问提出了荒谬的要求。它涉及我丈夫的睡眠安排。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/parenting-advice-visiting-mom-exiled-husband.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm36x000f3b79k2efihao@published"&gt;My sister “Charlotte” is getting married soon, and the wedding is in the city where I live. Our parents want to stay with Aiden and me—and my mom has a shocking stipulation about where Aiden should sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnnhbr000r3b79j7y078o2@published"&gt;My mother insists that Aiden can stay with friends or at a motel! The reason? They want to visit with their dogs, and Aiden is severely allergic to dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnqt35000y3b79ieespion@published"&gt;Even if I were willing to entertain this idea (which I am not), the entire house would have to be cleaned after the dogs left, and even then there would be no guarantee that Aiden’s allergies wouldn’t be triggered. It’s not a risk I’m willing to expose him to. My mother has never been fond of my husband “Aiden,” but this request is beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3ao000g3b79sn4z02jw@published"&gt;When I explained to my parents that they needed to make other arrangements, they threatened not to come to Charlotte’s wedding at all. Now my sister has joined my parents in insisting that Aiden stay elsewhere (she and her fiance have even offered to let him stay at their place), adding that her wedding will be ruined if our parents aren’t there and it will be my fault. This is all so upsetting that&lt;em&gt; I’m &lt;/em&gt;considering not attending the wedding. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3dt000h3b799jmwczxo@published"&gt;—Not a Hotel&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3i2000j3b79i20elhio@published"&gt;Of course your parents should be at your sister’s wedding. But it is up to them—not you!—to figure out what to do with their dogs.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3k5000k3b79pnien8uh@published"&gt;As someone with a sensitive dog who can’t really be boarded, I sympathize with the hassle (to a point). There are plenty of good pet sitters out there—your parents can search for reputable local pet sitting businesses, ask their friends for recommendations, or try Rover.com. Pet-friendly hotels and Airbnbs also exist. And if your sister and her fiance were willing to let your husband stay at their place, they should also be willing to host your parents, if need be.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3mj000l3b79g0uoot63@published"&gt;Your family should be able to understand that you don’t want to see your husband displaced from his home, only to return and possibly have a serious allergic reaction to lingering pet dander. I think you’ve already done about all you can to explain this to them. Let them know that as far as you’re concerned, the conversation is over; if they try to pull you back into it, don’t engage. Your parents’ dogs are not your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3ok000m3b792cldk8jt@published"&gt;As for whether to attend your sister’s wedding, only you can make that call. If you don’t go, it could lead to a larger and more lasting rift in the family, which they might also blame you for. But they’re already blaming you for the current drama—&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you mentioned that your mother has never liked your husband—so maybe those are consequences you can live with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnikyc000lczj81szwnbvv@published"&gt;My husband and I frequently disagree about treating our daughter’s various childhood ailments. He immediately rushes to our pediatrician for antibiotics and sees nothing wrong with daily over-the-counter allergy medicine as a preventative, even when she’s not symptomatic. I tend towards a wait-and-see approach with minimal medical intervention. While I am not into the essential oil craze of my peers, I prefer healthy foods, saline nose sprays, teas, and other methods of easing common ear/nose/throat symptoms, with a doctor called in only for severe or prolonged symptoms. The kicker is that my husband is the stay-at-home parent and usually makes the medical decisions. I would prefer our daughter not become antibiotic-resistant because of overuse. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/08/parenting-advice-on-disagreements-about-health-care-for-kids.html"&gt;How can we resolve our different approaches to our child’s health?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any kind of exercise is good for your health, from simple things such walking—which is also &lt;a href="https://mymodernmet.com/walking-nature-reduce-negative-feelings/"&gt;great for your mental health&lt;/a&gt;—to more specialized activities such as powerlifting. But if you usually suffer from poor sleep, scientists seem to have found a great antidote for it in one particular type of workout. And while they all are likely to help as they tire you out, one excels at helping you rest, according to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the Harbin Sport University in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2 ai-insert-4-17585525" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-4-17585525" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desktop-blog-ad desktop-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists looked at 30 randomized controlled trials from a dozen countries. The data featured 2,500 participants of all ages, all of them with some kind of sleep issue. The test subjects reported their experience with different activities, such as resistance training, aerobics, or traditional Chinese exercises, like &lt;em&gt;qi gong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tai chi&lt;/em&gt;. However, one offered the best results overall—high-intensity yoga. The best part? All it required was practicing it for less than 30 minutes twice a week, with results becoming noticeable after about eight to 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an interesting find, the team knows there are a lot of fine details to this discovery. “Reasonable exercise intervention can effectively improve sleep disorders, but the best combination of exercise prescription variables is not yet clear,” write the researchers. “Further, high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings due to the limited studies included.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yoga is not your thing, a &lt;a href="https://fmch.bmj.com/content/13/1/e003056" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, points to resistance and strength training as the most effective to help you sleep, as they found it can improve participants’ sleep by 35% more than aerobic exercise. However, keeping healthy sleep habits seemed to be better at ensuring a good rest rather than the exercise itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists also recommend paying attention at the timing of your exercise. For example, aerobic exercise causes the body to release endorphins, which can put your brain in an active mode that may keep you awake. That’s why you should exercise at least one to two hours before going to bed, to give your body time to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have solid evidence that exercise does, in fact, help you fall asleep more quickly and improves sleep quality,” Dr. Charlene Gamaldo &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins Medicine. “But there’s still some debate as to what time of day you should exercise. I encourage people to listen to their bodies to see how well they sleep in response to when they work out.”

On Tuesday, the first two patients to recover were discharged, the WHO chief revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever that was first discovered in Africa in the 1970s.

              &lt;p&gt;Fewer Americans say they &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/693362/drinking-rate-new-low-alcohol-concerns-surge.aspx"&gt;drink alcohol&lt;/a&gt; now than they have done for decades, but for those that do, the habit appears to have become dramatically deadlier over time, with the alcohol-related death rate in the U.S. almost doubling in the last twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles examined data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find that the rate of alcohol-related death increased between 1999 and 2024, with an especially sharp uptick during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. And while such deaths have declined since that peak, they remain markedly high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted policies to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and improve access to treatment,” the authors write in a paper &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0004623"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in PLOS Global Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A shocking rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new findings jibe with past studies that also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alcohol-is-killing-more-americans-than-ever-1840862638"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; alcohol-related deaths in America have been climbing for decades. But it remained unclear as to the specific kinds of deaths caused by alcohol, or whether the increase in deadly drinking seen during the pandemic has been sustained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To try and tease apart the answers to those questions, the researchers analyzed mortality data from the CDC across 14 causes of death induced by alcohol use. These included alcoholic liver disease, several forms of alcohol poisoning, as well as mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the rate of alcohol-related deaths rose 89% between 1999 and 2024, the researchers found. The single deadliest year during this period was 2021, which saw 54,258 reported deaths that year. By 2024, deaths had begun to level off, but the average alcohol-induced death rate was still 25% higher than it was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Trends in deadly drinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings also offer more clarity on who is dying from alcohol misuse, and why, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of alcohol-related deaths were caused by alcoholic liver disease, followed by mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol. Interestingly, the rate of alcohol poisoning deaths remained low throughout the study period, indicating that acute overdoses are relatively uncommon compared to chronic and heavy alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alcohol-related deaths have historically been more common among men, but the researchers’ findings suggest that may be changing: They found that the single largest increase in the death rate of any demographic during the study period was among women aged 25–34, followed by men in the same age group. American Indian and Alaskan Native populations were also found to be at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The rapid rise of alcohol-induced deaths among women is particularly concerning. Although men still die at higher rates, the gender gap appears to be closing,” said senior study author Maria R. D’Orsogna, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Computational Medicine at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-analysis-alcohol-deaths.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Notably, for the population aged 25–34, the male-to-female mortality ratio has decreased from three-to-one in 1999 to two-to-one in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that they looked at deaths most directly tied to alcohol use, so their findings likely do not capture the full toll of alcohol on Americans’ health. Alcohol is known to raise the risk or worsen myriad chronic health conditions, including certain cancers. And other research has &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics-z/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-related-emergencies-and-deaths-united-states#:~:text=The%20Alcohol%2DRelated%20Disease%20Impact,States%2C%20behind%20tobacco%2C%20poor%20diet"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that more than 178,000 deaths in the U.S. linked to excessive alcohol use occur every year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to figure out how best to prevent these deaths, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rise in alcohol-induced mortality and its heterogeneous trends across demographics highlight the need for a better understanding of the socioeconomic factors linked to excessive alcohol consumption and of targeted prevention and treatment efforts, particularly for males, youth, and the [American Indian/Alaska Native] population,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

            As a group of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/health/five-things-to-watch-acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting"&gt;meets to make recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on who should get the updated Covid-19 shot this season, a newly published analysis from dozens of researchers emphasizes the “substantial” benefits of broad vaccine recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00043b6nta9lb2us@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration has already made significant changes to this season’s shots: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/health/covid-vaccines-fda"&gt;limiting approval&lt;/a&gt; to adults 65 and older, and younger people who are at higher risk from Covid-19. The forthcoming vote from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, carries additional implications for vaccine access – and there are signs that the group could restrict access even further.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00053b6nrj9xrwiu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But scientific projection models from nine teams of researchers, summarized in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.32469&amp;amp;utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2025.32469" target="_blank"&gt;study published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Network Open, show that sticking to a universal Covid-19 vaccine recommendation – as has been in place in the US in recent years – has the potential to save thousands more lives than limiting the recommendation to high-risk groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00063b6ng3s36xhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While focusing on vaccination among individuals at the highest risk for severe outcomes, including those aged 65 and older and those with comorbidities, remains an effective ongoing strategy, our scenario projections demonstrate that maintaining the recommendation for all individuals to receive reformulated vaccines has the potential to save thousands more lives through both direct and indirect effects,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00073b6nfdz5js66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past five years, the &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub&lt;/a&gt; has provided nearly 20 rounds of projections estimating Covid-19 disease burden. Various teams build their models with a unique set of assumptions, which are then combined into ensemble projections for six scenarios based on different vaccine recommendations and viral immune escape — vulnerability to things like a new variant or waning immunity from prior infection or vaccination. The group’s work was used to guide the expansion of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00215-0/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;primary COVID-19 vaccine schedule to school-age children&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7129e1.htm?s_cid=mm7129e1_w" target="_blank"&gt;booster recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in fall 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00083b6nilxhkhn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Models for last season – covering the period from April 2024 to April 2025 – included a worst-case scenario where there was no vaccine recommendation and high immune escape, and a best-case scenario where there was a universal vaccine recommendation and low immune escape.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00093b6nna8o32ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scenario that the researchers say was most similar to the way last season actually played out involved high immune escape. The universal vaccine recommendation that was in place in this scenario was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 11% and deaths by 13% – essentially averting 104,000 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths.

            If vaccine recommendations had been limited to high-risk individuals, the benefit of the vaccine would still be substantial: an 8% reduction in hospitalizations and 10% reduction in deaths. But the expanded recommendations for all ages was projected to prevent an additional 28,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths, the study showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Adults ages 65 and older benefit the most under all vaccine scenarios, both directly and indirectly. A universal vaccine recommendation would reduce the burden of Covid-19 on seniors by an additional 3 to 4%, averting about 11,000 hospitalizations  and 1,000 deaths in this group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This finding suggests substantial indirect benefits of universal vaccination and the continued value of broad vaccine recommendations,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The projections for last season were first published by the Scenario Modeling Hub in June 2024, to help inform decision-making ahead of last year’s ACIP meeting. Actual epidemiological trends differed from assumptions that were made in the models at that time – burden was greater than expected during the summer and less in the winter – but projected deaths aligned closely with the models, creating confidence in the “robust accuracy” of the models among the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Projections for &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this season&lt;/a&gt;, published by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub in June, paint a similar picture to last season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Recommending updated Covid-19 vaccines only for high-risk individuals will help to avoid an estimated 90,000 hospitalizations and 7,000 deaths – but broadening the recommendation for all people in the US would save an additional 1,000 lives and prevent an additional 26,000 hospitalizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We expect continued substantial burden of disease from COVID-19 in the US,” the researchers wrote in an executive summary of the findings. “All vaccination strategies are projected to significantly reduce disease burden. The greatest benefits will be seen if vaccines are offered to all ages.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            All work by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub is public and “available for consideration” by ACIP and other experts, said Dr. Justin Lessler, a leader with the modeling hub and professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfphv52n00023b6n5uslhzsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The modeling work was not presented at ACIP’s June meeting this year and there’s “no indication” that it will presented at this week’s meeting, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpi2uif00053b6niie22wzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We continue to share our results with the CDC and are working to make them more easily available to a broader range of organizations who are providing vaccine guidance,” Lessler said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

These included emotional eating, where a person&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14043751/food-beverages-voters-stress-eat-drink-2024-presidential-election.html"&gt; eats in response to negative emotions&lt;/a&gt;; external eating, or eating because a food looks good rather than hunger; and restrained eating, or controlling diet to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-bbce0c50-93fc-11f0-984f-75cae465fdc7"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that all participants experienced weight loss and drops in vital health markers like cholesterol and A1C, which measures the amount of glucose in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants also initially were less likely to emotionally eat. But after a year, emotional eaters generally went back to their old behaviors, hampering their weight loss progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;External eaters, however, continued cutting back on the practice throughout the experiment, suggesting Ozempic and similar drugs may be more beneficial for external eaters than emotional eaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are unsure exactly why emotional eaters were more likely to rebound, but they suggested it may be because their behavior is rooted in deeper psychological issues like depression and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Japan found that people who tend to 'emotionally eat' benefitted less from GLP-1 medications like Ozempic (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Daisuke Yabe, senior study author and professor of medicine at Kyoto University in Japan, said:  'Pre-treatment assessment of eating behavior patterns may help predict who will benefit most from GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective for individuals who experience weight gain or elevated blood glucose levels due to overeating triggered by external stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, their effectiveness is less expected in cases where emotional eating is the primary cause.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in eight US adults has reported taking Ozempic or similar medications at least once for diabetes or weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1744#:~:text=5.,prevention%20and%20chronic%20disease%20prevention."&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; estimates about one in five Americans reports emotionally eating 'often or very often' due to stress or other negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/clinical-diabetes-and-healthcare/articles/10.3389/fcdhc.2025.1638681/full"&gt;Frontiers in Clinical Diabetes and Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 92 Japanese adults who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age was 58, and just over half of participants were men. They had lived with type 2 diabetes for an average of 12 years, and their average body mass index (BMI) was 30, which is considered obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 40 percent were given oral semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, while 32 received the injectable form of the drug.

But by the 12-month mark, restrained and emotional eating behaviors returned to their baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;External eating, however, continued to decrease over the year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests people who tended to practice emotional eating were more likely to return to the unhealthy habit than those who practice external eating, resulting in less weight loss over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takehiro Kato, second study author and professor at Gifu University in Japan, said: 'One possible explanation is that emotional eating is more strongly influenced by psychological factors which may not be directly addressed by GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Individuals with prominent emotional eating tendencies may require additional behavioral or psychological support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including the small sample size.

Respiratory virus season is coming. Policy changes based on misinterpreted data will have immediate, real-world consequences. Frankly, even if the votes end up in favor of these vaccines, so much damage is being done through these public shows of vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine rhetoric.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Thursday and Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plans to vote on three shots – the measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine; the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth; and Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The upcoming votes threaten parental choice,” Steier said. “Without ACIP recommendations, insurance may not cover vaccines. The Vaccines for Children program could stop providing them. Families who want to protect their children may lose that option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The former top official in charge of vaccination at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542405/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-advisory-panel-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-shot-in-infants" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B vaccine recommendation, for example, may be pushed from birth to four years of age, which could mean the virus, which has dropped by 99% among young people, begins spreading in greater numbers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The committee may also &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/16/vaccine-recommendations-anti-vax-data" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;further narrow&lt;/a&gt; Covid vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’re expecting them to present unverified VAERS reports as if they’re confirmed vaccine deaths,” Steier said, comparing that tactic to “treating every 911 call as proof of a crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Several new members have a history of opposing vaccines, especially Covid vaccines and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Remember, the Lord Jesus did not fear lepers, and leprosy was (and continues to be) a highly contagious infectious disease,” Catherine Stein, a professor in the department of population and quantitative health sciences at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220601043817/https://www.allinohio.com/an-epidemiologists-perspective-on-covid-19-the-other-side/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021. “Not only did He heal them, but He touched them. He showed no fear, nor did He ‘socially distance’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stein wrote that she was motivated by her religious ideology to reject precautions like wearing face masks, which she said function as a “symbol of fear” while also harming the wearer’s health, which is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She argued that “as Christians, we should not fear death”. She also claimed that “this virus is not the scary killer the media and government portray it to be”, even in the midst of deadly waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In her off-work hours, Stein has &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20484834-stein-hb-624-testimony" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worked&lt;/a&gt; as a researcher for Health Freedom Ohio, an antivax group &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; with Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization previously helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is now head of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In February 2020, she signed on to a &lt;a href="https://freedomofconscience.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRF-Roundtable-Protecting-Religious-Freedom.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Trump to reexamine school and daycare vaccine mandates and to focus on “ending the persecution of the unvaccinated people of faith”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kirk Milhoan is a pediatric cardiologist who has advocated against Covid vaccines because of the extremely rare possibility of myocarditis, or swelling of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We should stop it and test it more before we move forward,” Milhoan &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; KFF Health News in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Milhoan is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance, which has promoted ineffective and often unsafe ivermectin treatments for Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Hawaii medical board filed complaints and &lt;a href="https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2022/04/doctors-cleared-of-covid-19-misinformation-allegations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; his medical license, though his license was ultimately upheld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evelyn Griffin, once an obstetrician/gynecologist who &lt;a href="https://x.com/EvelynGriffinM1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shifted&lt;/a&gt; to “holistic health”, implied at a “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/centralcitynews.us/videos/3843797775903484/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Louisiana health freedom day&lt;/a&gt;” event in May 2024 that vaccines are unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When the [Covid] vaccine came out, they blindly believed that the vaccine had no harm,” she said of other doctors. “In medical school, we were taught the childhood vaccines – we were taught that they were harmless, and we were taught to just memorize the schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Griffin participated in a “Stop Vax Passports” &lt;a href="https://stopvaxpassports.org/webinar-covid-injections-and-women-miscarriage-infertility-and-more/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;, speaking about her personal experience “treating post-injection women” and “defeating vaccine mandates for children in Louisiana.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hillary Blackburn, the daughter-in-law of Sen. Marsha Blackburn, is a pharmacist who recently &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7b57KtuzDf/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; vaccines may cause autoimmune issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Raymond Pollak is a transplant surgeon about whom little is known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new advisers will join eight others chosen by Kennedy in June after he fired the previous 17 advisers in an unprecedented move. A group called the Evidence Collective documented more than &lt;a href="https://www.evicollective.org/tec-briefs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50 falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; from the first meeting of the new ACIP group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vaccine committee may have up to 19 members, which means there are still six potential spots to be filled. Usually, the vetting and training process for new advisers takes months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1idzBiTlJpZ2pYd25LY0VuOUdnSDNYN1ctajVDZkpzUnVpVkhIXzQwWTZfdldIWUdjU0pzbUZXVmhLMzZlNndpNkgyTzViTFVrN3RXZGh3djVuRHJiVlRKS1ViUGpfZUxYOGlDN210TGptb1lyclMteQ</guid></item><item><title>在过去的12个月中，美国有6人死于狂犬病。须知事项- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/health/rabies-animal-vaccine-disease-health-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            While human cases of rabies in the United States are rare, it’s still a deadly disease: six people have died from rabies nationwide since September 2024, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson confirmed to CNN. In addition, the CDC is tracking 14 potential outbreaks in 20 states,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w79u00013b6n24jvpvix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What is rabies? How is it transmitted and by which animals? What are the symptoms of infection in humans, and is there a vaccine? How should rabies exposure be treated? And what can people do to reduce their risk of exposure?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w79u00023b6nj76mna0q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w38y00003b6nsorm7l7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is rabies, and how is it transmitted?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00073b6nafmcn7j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Rabies is caused by a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821" target="_blank"&gt;deadly virus&lt;/a&gt; that is spread mainly through the saliva of infected animals. The rabies virus is part of the Rhabdoviridae family and genus Lyssavirus, which comprises 16 virus species. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;All 16&lt;/a&gt; can cause rabies disease in humans, though the rabies virus is by far the most common cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00083b6nw3gngx37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This virus is typically transmitted through an animal bite, though scratches or &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;direct contact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23930-mucosa" target="_blank"&gt;mucosa&lt;/a&gt; can also spread the virus. For instance, if the saliva of the infected animal comes in contact with a human’s eyes, mouth or open wounds, the virus could be spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00093b6no90dkcc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus primarily affects the central nervous system, with inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;incubation period&lt;/a&gt;, the time between exposure to the virus and symptom onset, may last weeks to months. Once a person starts showing symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs are responsible for the majority of human rabies deaths worldwide, and young children are frequent victims, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, where rabid dogs are far less common due to effective rabies prevention programs, contact with infected bats is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Nearly%20three%20in%20four%20Americans,States%20were%20infected%20by%20bats." target="_blank"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of human rabies deaths. Rabies can be found in many other wildlife species, including raccoons, skunks, coyotes and foxes. According to the CDC, around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;4,000&lt;/a&gt; animal rabies cases are reported every year, with 90% occurring in wildlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000c3b6n5ug26anx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; During the incubation period, there are typically no symptoms. Weeks to months after exposure, an infected person may experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that can include fever, headache and overall body aches. Discomfort, such as a prickling sensation, at the site of the bite is also possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000e3b6ndrrfnljc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms quickly progress. Within two weeks, the infected person starts having increasingly severe symptoms such as confusion, agitation, hallucinations and aggressive behavior. A classic symptom is hydrophobia, or fear of water: Despite feeling very thirsty, the individual may seem to panic at the sight of fluids. The person may also produce a lot of saliva and appear agitated, thrashing arms and legs. Death occurs not long after.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the CDC, someone traveling to areas where rabid dogs are a problem is at a higher risk of contracting the rabies virus, as are people who may encounter animals through work or leisure activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000h3b6nbq8kcmi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;helpful website&lt;/a&gt; that lists rabies status by country. Information includes the prevalence of rabies, whether a robust surveillance and prevention program is in place, and whether treatment is readily available if exposure occurs. WHO also has a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;useful website&lt;/a&gt; documenting areas with recent cases of human rabies. Annually, an estimated 60,000 people die from rabies worldwide; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/rabies#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of these fatalities occur in Africa and Asia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000i3b6njqhp26f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are visiting a country with a higher rabies risk, consider taking extra precautions, especially if it will be difficult to access rabies treatment if you are exposed to the virus. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians, animal control officers, wildlife workers, laboratory workers who handle live rabies virus and people in similar professions should also consider prophylaxis. The same goes for people planning to hike in remote areas with dog-transmitted rabies or to explore caves in regions where rabid bats have been.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000j3b6nwlhgiynk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000k3b6n3lt9746x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Someone at high risk of being exposed to rabies can get the rabies vaccine as part of what’s called pre-exposure prophylaxis — that is, vaccination before any exposure occurs — to provide protection in case contact with the virus happens later. In these cases, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/pre-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the vaccine spaced seven days apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000l3b6n8wqau4mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Depending on an individual’s risk exposure, the CDC recommends taking additional precautions. People in Risk Category 1, the highest risk, should have their blood checked for antibody titers six months after the second dose of the vaccine to make sure they are optimally protected. This category includes lab workers in contact with live or concentrated virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfolvd2p000a3b6nmxykdihk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People in Risk Category 2, which includes those who frequently handle bats or dead animals, should have their antibody titers checked every two years. Most veterinarians, technicians, wildlife workers and animal control officers are considered Risk Category 3: They can either opt for a one-time antibody titer check between one to three years after the two-dose vaccination or receive a one-time booster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000m3b6ngy4yrvfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the general US population, however, the rabies vaccine is not recommended as pre-exposure prophylaxis. The vaccine is essential, though, as part of post-exposure prophylaxis, the therapies given to someone after a possible rabies exposure to prevent the disease from developing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000n3b6nhzb2whca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The clearest example is someone who has been bitten by a wild dog, bat, fox, raccoon or other animal known to carry rabies. If someone had direct contact with a bat — for instance, waking up to find a bat in the room — this is also considered a possible exposure &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/diagnosis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;unless a bite or scratch&lt;/a&gt; can be definitively ruled out. If possible, contain the animal so it can be observed and tested, but do not attempt to capture it if that may result in additional exposure. If you find a dead bat, do not throw it away. Do not touch it or allow other people or pets to touch it. Instead, call animal control so that the bat can be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000p3b6ntzx1l1vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are not sure whether a possible exposure warrants treatment, it is always best to contact a health care provider. Your local or state health department can also help evaluate whether you need rabies-related care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; If you suspect rabies exposure, seek medical care right away. First, contact your primary care physician, who will generally refer you to the hospital emergency department for the first part of the treatment. Some urgent care centers may also administer the treatment. If you do not have a primary care physician, go directly to the emergency department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000s3b6nfy45w35g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have a wound, it will be washed thoroughly with soap and water immediately. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html#:~:text=Post%2Dexposure%20prophylaxis%20recommendations&amp;amp;text=A%20dose%20of%20human%20rabies,14%20after%20the%20first%20dose." target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, what will happen next depends on whether you have ever been vaccinated against rabies. If you have never been vaccinated against rabies, you will be given both the human rabies immunoglobulin and a rabies vaccine. You will then need three more doses of the vaccine, on Days 3, 7 and 14 (Day 0 being the day you received the first dose). People with immune disorders would receive a fifth dose on Day 28.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000t3b6neqxkxak8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have been vaccinated against rabies, you would not receive the immunoglobulin. However, you would still need two doses of the vaccine, one given on the initial day and one three days later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep your pets up-to-date on their &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;rabies vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Stay away from wildlife and stray animals, and make sure your pets do as well. Also teach children not to handle or approach unfamiliar animals. If you see a wild animal such as a fox or raccoon behaving unusually, do not get close, and contact animal control instead. In addition, try to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/bats.html" target="_blank"&gt;prevent bats&lt;/a&gt; from getting inside your home through windows, chimneys or other holes. Most importantly, if you, a family member or a pet is potentially exposed to rabies, seek medical care immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voluntary Coalition includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York State, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New York City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Partnership Brings Together Public Health Agencies and Leaders to Share Expertise, Improve Coordination, and Promote and Protect Evidence-Based Public Health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work Groups Created to Identify Opportunities for Collaboration Including Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Vaccine Recommendations, Data Collection, Infectious Disease Management and Laboratory Services&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 18, 2025 —&lt;/strong&gt; Several Northeastern states and America’s largest city have been collaborating since early 2025 and today formally announced the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, a voluntary regional coalition of public health agencies and leaders, brought together to share expertise, improve coordination, enhance capacity, strengthen regional readiness, and promote and protect evidence-based public health.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;The Collaborative’s shared purpose is to work together in new ways – optimizing the use of shared resources, innovating and reimagining core services – to ensure trust in public health, respond to public health threats, advance community health and strengthen confidence in vaccines and science-based medicine.  The group’s shared goal is to protect the health, safety and well-being of all residents by providing information based on science, data, and evidence, while working to ensure equitable access to vaccines, medications and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional partnership, which was informally established several months ago, held its first in-person meeting in Rhode Island in August. The Collaborative has already formed interjurisdictional working groups to identify opportunities for collaboration and shared planning across multiple public health disciplines including public health emergency preparedness and response, vaccine recommendations and purchasing, data collection and analysis, infectious disease, epidemiology and laboratory capacity and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Collaborative worked together on science-based guidance for health care personnel (HCP) advising on precautions health care workers should take to protect themselves and patients during respiratory virus season. Other examples of collaborative efforts include sharing information on public health emergency preparedness related to three FIFA (International Federation of Association Football) World Cup host cities within the collaborative, exploring workforce pipeline activities given the understaffing in public health and coordinating state lab related activities and services.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecticut Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “In public health, we are always stronger together. Pathogens know no borders. Particularly in the northeast, people cross borders daily for work and school. In a time of significant change in public health, we have benefited from the enhanced collaborations between our jurisdictions. We are confident that we will preserve and protect core public health principles and services as we navigate current changes together.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maine CDC Director, Dr. Puthiery Va&lt;/strong&gt; said, “The people of Maine are known for their resilience, neighborly support, and a collaborative approach to solving community challenges. This spirit is evident in the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, which serves as an incubator for solutions in public health. By working together, we can build more adaptable, sustainable, and resilient public health framework for the region.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health Robbie Goldstein, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “When our states speak in concert, our voice carries farther, and our impact deepens. Those who work in public health are entrusted with a profound responsibility – a promise – to protect the health and safety of those in our states, to advance equity, and to ground every decision in data and evidence. Strong public health must stand high above ideology. Our region understands this, and we are moving forward, resolute, united, and guided by science.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Jersey Acting Health Commissioner Jeff Brown&lt;/strong&gt; said, “The interconnectedness of our populations and shared health challenges across the Northeast make this Collaborative a natural synergy and extension of our longstanding partnerships with peer health agencies to support the health of the people of New Jersey. Public health requires regular sharing of information, ideas, and best practices across jurisdictions and state lines. Whether it’s responding to a pandemic or an outbreak or preparing for a large-scale event such as the upcoming FIFA World Cup, with three host cities in the Northeast, working together helps keep our residents safe and healthy. We look forward to continuing to do so with our colleagues in the Collaborative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “Everyone benefits when we work together.  I am excited about this collaborative; we all share the same goal of achieving health and well-being for our people. New York is proud to be part of the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. By working together, we are creating a more adaptable, sustainable and resilient public health system for our state and the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Dr. Debra Bogen&lt;/strong&gt; said, “Protecting public health has always been a collaborative effort. Continuing to work with public health experts in other states allows the exchange of best practices, pursuit of efficiencies, and opportunities for collaboration to better meet the needs of Pennsylvanians.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhode Island Department of Health Director Jerry Larkin, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “Collaboration is the core of public health. We look forward to continuing to work with the Northeast Public Health Collaborative to improve information sharing, coordinate on public health initiatives, and develop policy that is grounded in science and data. This partnership will advance our work to prevent disease and promote the health and safety of the people in every community in Rhode Island.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York City Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse&lt;/strong&gt; said, "As the oldest and largest local health department in the nation, the New York City Health Department is proud to be a member of the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. We must always protect our public health infrastructure, reject misinformation, and maintain trust in science. The collaborative is working together to rebuild public trust, and provide factual information, so people can make informed decisions about their health, and continue our critical work to address health inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Northeast Public Health Collaborative members share common public health goals and objectives, they recognize that each state and city is independent with their own diverse populations and unique sets of laws, regulations and histories. Members may choose to participate in or adapt those specific initiatives consistent with their particular needs, values, objectives, and statutory or regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A bat in Kent County has tested positive for rabies, the health department announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the county’s first rabies-positive animal of 2025. Officials did not specify where in Kent County the bat was found, but they urged residents to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“During the fall, bats start looking for safe places to roost for the winter, which can sometimes lead them into homes or businesses,” stated Cathy Armstrong, communicable disease program supervisor. “If it’s unclear whether a person or pet may have had direct contact with a bat, testing the bat is the best way to rule out any risk of rabies exposure. Because bats have very small teeth, a bite may not always be obvious in situations such as when someone was sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capture a bat, you can use a container and a piece of cardboard while wearing gloves, pants and long sleeves. You can then call the Kent County Health Department at 616.632.7228 to determine whether the bat needs to be tested. If it does, you’ll bring the bat to the animal shelter for testing and then wait for results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, you shouldn’t touch bats or other wild animals, the health department said. You’re encouraged to keep your living spaces secure and make sure your pets are fully vaccinated against rabies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statewide, 32 rabid bats have been confirmed so far this year, according to KCHD.&lt;/p&gt;

While 82% of countries achieved reductions during this period, the rate of progress has slowed significantly across most regions, with some countries even experiencing a resurgence in NCD-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCDs are responsible for the majority of global deaths, while more than one billion people live with mental health conditions. Alarmingly, nearly 75% of deaths related to NCDs and mental health conditions occur in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 32 million lives lost each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just a few days—on 25 September 2025—Heads of State and Government will convene in New York for the Fourth United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting (HLM4) on prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being. The meeting aims to adopt an ambitious Political Declaration to accelerate global action and investment in these critical health and development areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions are silent killers, robbing us of lives and innovation," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "We have the tools to save lives and reduce suffering. Countries like Denmark, South Korea, and Moldova are leading the way, while others stalling. Investing in the fight against NCDs isn't just smart economics—it's an urgent necessity for thriving societies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCDs include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma), and diabetes, among others. Mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, are also highly prevalent across all countries and communities, affecting people of all ages and income levels. Without urgent and sustained action to tackle these, millions more lives will be lost prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low progress, lives at risk&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the majority of countries made progress in reducing the risk of dying prematurely from an NCD between 2010 and 2019, 60% experienced a slowdown in progress compared to the previous decade. Denmark recorded the largest improvements for both sexes. Among countries in other regions, NCD mortality also declined for both sexes in China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest gains were driven by declines in cardiovascular disease and certain cancers—such as stomach and colorectal cancers for both sexes, cervical and breast cancers for women, and lung and prostate cancers for men. In contrast, pancreatic, liver cancers and neurological conditions contributed to rising mortality in many countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solutions are affordable and cost effective&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solutions to tackle NCDs and promote mental health and well-being are both affordable and highly cost-effective. Yet, governments often face intense lobbying from powerful industries whose products contribute to disease. Tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food companies frequently attempt to block, weaken, or delay life-saving policies—ranging from health taxes to marketing restrictions aimed at protecting children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is unacceptable that commercial interests are profiting from increasing deaths and disease,” said Dr Etienne Krug, Director of WHO’s Department of Health Determinants, Promotion and Prevention. “Governments must put people before profits and ensure evidence-based policy is not derailed by corporate pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling up implementation of WHO’s ‘Best Buys’, a set of high impact interventions including tobacco and alcohol taxation, protecting children from harmful marketing, managing hypertension, and scaling up cervical cancer screening would cost just an additional US$3 per person per year on average. The return on investment is substantial: by 2030, full implementation could save 12 million lives, prevent 28 million heart attacks and strokes, add 150 million healthy life years, and generate over US$1 trillion in economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Political will to change the future&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming Fourth UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting (HLM4) on NCDs and mental health is the most significant political opportunity of the decade to drive transformative change. With a bold Political Declaration, Heads of State and Government can not only recommit to achieving the 2030 targets but also set the vision for the next decades —charting a new course that will save lives and improve well-being for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know what works. The time to act is now. Governments that act decisively will protect and save lives, cut costs, and unlock growth. Those that delay will pay in lost lives and weaker economies,” Dr Devora Kestel, Director of WHO’s Department for NCDs and Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is calling on leaders, partners, and communities to advocate for concrete actions, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;funding and implementing&lt;/strong&gt; WHO’s ‘Best Buys’, adapted to national needs;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taxing&lt;/strong&gt; tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strengthening&lt;/strong&gt; primary health care for prevention, early detection and treatment;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;protecting&lt;/strong&gt; children from harmful marketing;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expanding access&lt;/strong&gt; to essential medicines and technologies;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;securing financing&lt;/strong&gt; through domestic budgets, health taxes and targeted aid;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;setting bold targets&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;track progress&lt;/strong&gt; with strong accountability;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stopping industry interference&lt;/strong&gt; in health policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;HLM4 offers a unique opportunity to adopt an ambitious, action-oriented and achievable Political Declaration on NCDs and mental health—grounded in evidence, anchored in human rights, and aimed at delivering impact through and beyond 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has identified &lt;a href="/news/item/26-05-2023-more-ways--to-save-more-lives--for-less-money----world-health-assembly-adopts-more-best-buys--to-tackle-noncommunicable-diseases"&gt;29 highly effective and affordable measures called ‘Best Buys’&lt;/a&gt; that countries can put in place to prevent and manage major noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers, and respiratory diseases.

The other five cases are believed to be locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The infectious carrier is understood to have travelled to Sydney from Perth (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Saturday, WA health confirmed a further two cases in Perth, which are believed to be linked to travel from Bali. WA has so far recorded 35 measles cases this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NSW Health urged those who were &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6732781/Sydney-woman-14th-person-struck-measles-Christmas.html" class=""&gt;experiencing measles symptoms, or have questions about measles,&lt;/a&gt; to call their GP or Healthdirect on 1800 022 222.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is given free for children at 12 and 18 months of age and anyone born after 1965 who hasn't yet had two doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children can have a dose from six months of age if they are travelling overseas but NSW Health said parents should consult their GP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People who are unsure of whether they have had two doses should get a vaccine, as additional doses are safe,' NSW Health added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is particularly important prior to travel.

After a month and several unsuccessful treatments, the patient started plugging his medical history into ChatGPT, &lt;a href="https://www.anncaserep.com/open-access/the-use-of-chatgpt-in-diagnosing-tularemiandash-a-case-9930.pdf"&gt;which offered a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;: tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. The chatbot was correct, and the case was later written up in &lt;a href="https://www.anncaserep.com/open-access/the-use-of-chatgpt-in-diagnosing-tularemiandash-a-case-9930.pdf"&gt;a peer-reviewed medical study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Around the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; described a man who appeared at a hospital in the United States with signs of psychosis, paranoid that his neighbor had been poisoning him. It turns out, the patient had asked ChatGPT for alternatives to sodium chloride, or table salt. The chatbot &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;suggested sodium bromide&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to clean pools. He’d been eating the toxic substance for three months and, once he’d stopped, required three weeks in a psychiatric unit to stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You’re probably familiar with consulting Google for a mystery ailment. You search the internet for your symptoms, sometimes find helpful advice, and sometimes get sucked into a vortex of anxiety and dread, convinced that you’ve got a rare, undiagnosed form of cancer. Now, thanks to the wonder that is generative AI, you can carry out this process in more detail. Meet Dr. ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;AI chatbots are an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;ChatGPT is not a doctor in the same way that Google is not a doctor. Searching for medical information on either platform is just as likely to lead you to the wrong conclusion as it is to point toward the correct diagnosis. Unlike Google search, however, which simply points users to information, ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) invite people to have a conversation about it. They’re designed to be approachable, engaging, and always available. This makes AI chatbots an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given &lt;a href="/future-perfect/361620/bloomberg-johns-hopkins-free-medical-school-doctor-shortage"&gt;the ongoing doctor shortage&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391483/us-health-care-doctors-salary-medical-school"&gt;the broader barriers to accessing health care&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the rabbit fever anecdote shows, these tools can also ingest all kinds of data and, having been trained on reams of medical journals, sometimes arrive at expert-level conclusions that doctors missed. Or it might give you really terrible medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a difference between asking a chatbot for medical advice and talking to it about your health in general. Done right, talking to ChatGPT could lead to better conversations with your doctor and better care. Just don’t let the AI talk you into eating pool cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-right-and-wrong-ways-to-talk-to-dr-chatgpt" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right and wrong ways to talk to Dr. ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plenty of people are talking to ChatGPT about their health. About one in six adults in the United States say they use AI chatbots for medical advice on a monthly basis, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;according to a 2024 KFF poll&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of them aren’t confident in the accuracy of the information the bots provide — and frankly, that level of skepticism is appropriate given the stubborn tendency for LLMs to hallucinate and the potential for bad health information to cause harm. The real challenge for the average user is knowing how to distinguish between fact and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Honestly, I think people need to be very careful about using it for any medical purpose, especially if they don’t have the expertise around knowing what’s true and what’s not,” said &lt;a href="https://www.daneshjoulab.com/people"&gt;Dr. Roxana Daneshjou&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and AI researcher at the Stanford School of Medicine. “When it’s correct, it does a pretty good job, but when it’s incorrect, it can be pretty catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Chatbots also have a tendency to be sycophantic, or eager to please, which means they might steer you in the wrong direction if they think that’s what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The situation is precarious enough, Daneshjou added, that she encourages patients to go instead to Dr. Google, which serves up trusted sources. The search giant &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/health-info-knowledge-graph/"&gt;has been collaborating with experts from the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School for a decade&lt;/a&gt; to present verified information about conditions and symptoms after the rise of something called “cyberchondria,” or health anxiety enabled by the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This condition &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB939076866193196830"&gt;is much older than Google&lt;/a&gt;, actually. People have been searching for answers to their health questions since the Usenet days of the 1980s, and by the mid-2000s, eight in 10 people &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2006/10/29/online-health-search-2006/"&gt;were using the internet&lt;/a&gt; to search for health information. Now, regardless of their reliability, chatbots are poised to receive more and more of these queries. Google even puts &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/google-ai-search"&gt;its problematic AI-generated results&lt;/a&gt; for medical questions above &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/im-feeling-yucky-searching-for-symptoms/"&gt;the vetted results from its symptom checker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;If you’ve got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But if you skip the symptom checking side of things, tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful if you just want to learn more about what’s going on with your health based on what your doctor’s already told you or to gain a better understanding of their jargony notes. Chatbots are designed to be conversational, and they’re good at it. If you’ve got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions. If you’ve gotten some test results and need to make a decision with your doctor about the best next steps, you can rehearse that with a chatbot without actually asking the AI for any advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In fact, when it comes to just talking, there’s some evidence that ChatGPT is better at it. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37115527/"&gt;study from 2023&lt;/a&gt; compared real physician answers to health questions from a Reddit forum to AI-generated responses when a chatbot was prompted with the same questions. Health care professionals then evaluated all of the responses and found that the chatbot-generated ones &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/im-feeling-yucky-searching-for-symptoms/"&gt;were both higher quality and more empathetic&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the same thing as a doctor being in the same room as a patient, discussing their health. Now is a good time to point out that, on average, patients get &lt;a href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/publications/measuring-primary-care-exam-length-using-electronic-health-record"&gt;just 18 minutes&lt;/a&gt; with their primary care doctor on any given visit. If you go just once a year, that’s not very much time to talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You should be aware that, unlike your human doctor, ChatGPT is not HIPAA-compliant. Chatbots generally &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information"&gt;have very few privacy protections&lt;/a&gt;. That means you should expect any health information you upload will get stored in the AI’s memory and be used to train large language models in the future. It’s also theoretically possible that your data could end up being included in an output for someone else’s prompt. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/how-to-protect-your-privacy-from-chatgpt-and-other-ai-chatbots/"&gt;more private ways to use chatbots&lt;/a&gt;, but still, the hallucination problem and the potential for catastrophe exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-future-of-bot-assisted-health-care" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of bot-assisted health care&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even if you’re not using AI to figure out medical mysteries, there’s a chance your doctor is. &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/o78em1y1w4i4/T7F5sDDiUC8KJzLQXfJoy/004be7f43562d318115a294cf626be7f/ClinicianOfTheFuture_2025.pdf?utm_source=banner&amp;amp;utm_medium=dg&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cotf&amp;amp;utm_content=rpt"&gt;According to a 2025 Elsevier report&lt;/a&gt;, about half of clinicians said they’d used an AI tool for work and slightly more said these tools save them time, and one in five say they’ve used AI for a second opinion on a complex case. This doesn’t necessarily mean your doctor is asking ChatGPT to figure out what your symptoms mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Doctors have been using AI-powered tools to help with everything from diagnosing patients to taking notes since well before ChatGPT even existed. These include clinical decision support systems built specifically for doctors, which currently outperform off-the-shelf chatbots — although the chatbots &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/traditional-diagnostic-decision-support-systems-outperform-generative-ai"&gt;can actually augment the existing tools&lt;/a&gt;. A 2023 study found that doctors working with ChatGPT &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825395"&gt;performed only slightly better&lt;/a&gt; at diagnosing test cases than those working independently. Interestingly, ChatGPT alone performed the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That study &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/health/chatgpt-ai-doctors-diagnosis.html"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt;, probably for the suggestion that AI chatbots are better than doctors at diagnosis. One of its co-authors, &lt;a href="https://research.bidmc.org/general-medicine/people/adam-rodman-md-mph-facp"&gt;Dr. Adam Rodman&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that this wouldn’t necessarily be the case if doctors would be more open to listening to ChatGPT rather than assuming the chatbots were wrong when the doctor disagreed with their conclusions. Sure, the AI can hallucinate, but it can also spot connections that humans may have missed. Again, look at the rabbit fever case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; LLM use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The average doctor has a sense of when something is hallucinating or going off the rails,” said Rodman, a hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School. “I don’t know that the average patient necessarily does.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nevertheless, in the near term, you shouldn’t expect to see Dr. ChatGPT making an appearance at your local clinic. You’re more likely to see AI working &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-you-say-no-to-your-doctor-using-an-ai-scribe-264701"&gt;as a scribe&lt;/a&gt;, saving your doctor time taking notes and possibly, one day, analyzing that data to help your doctor. Your doctor might use AI &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/health/ai-patient-messages-mychart.html"&gt;to help draft messages to patients&lt;/a&gt; more quickly. In the near future, as AI tools get better, it’s possible that more clinicians use AI for diagnosis and second opinions. That still doesn’t mean you should rush to ChatGPT with your urgent medical concerns.

The recommendations impact numerous programmes, including school meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Just in the yoghurt aisle alone, some products could escape without a label while others could be grouped with hot dogs and cookies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That’s a big worry for the US$2.6 trillion (S$3.3 trillion) food industry because these healthier items have been a bright spot as consumers have pulled away from packaged food and sparked trends, such as the surge in demand for high-protein options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Greek yoghurt, which has more protein than other varieties, is now in nearly 74 per cent of US households, up 2 percentage points in the last year, according to NielsenIQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Adding to the concern is that more than half of all calories consumed by Americans are considered ultra-processed by the Nova system, the most commonly used standards developed outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“We are focusing narrowly on nutrition,” said Mr Kennedy, who has said highly processed food is poisoning Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;In response to a request for comment for this story, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that “Americans deserve to know what’s in their food, so they can make informed choices for themselves and their families”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;So far, the administration largely hasn’t opted to unleash new regulations on the food industry, urging it to voluntarily strip out food dyes, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Crafting a definition of ultra-processed food could stretch out over years, giving big food companies time to influence the process, as they have successfully done for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Ms Rena Awada, a 43-year-old cooking blogger in Michigan, is emblematic of a shift toward healthier options. She looks for whole, unprocessed foods when she’s developing recipes or feeding her five kids. To boost protein levels, she might add Greek yogurt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;But navigating a healthy lifestyle could become a bit more complicated for Ms Awada and others in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I do try to limit the ultra-processed foods,” Ms Awada said. Sometimes she opts for convenience, but always checks ingredient labels, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I do like to know what I’m feeding my kids and what I’m using in my recipes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The debate over what should be considered ultra-processed food, or UPF, gets ratcheted up around foods engineered to deliver health benefits, such as higher protein or lowered sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That could ensnare a wide range of products, including protein powder, salad dressings, whole-grain breads with preservatives to extend shelf life and plant-based meat options, like those from Beyond Meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Mr John Thomas, a 33-year-old vegan bodybuilder based in Tampa, Florida, said he views some processed options, such as textured vegetable protein, as healthier than junk food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I view that as still a relatively healthy food,” he said. “It’s processed – but it’s not an Oreo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The Trump administration first floated the idea of defining ultra-processed food in July and a fierce lobbying fight is under way over whether a federal definition should focus on ingredients, processing or a combination. Some argue it should centre on how much a type of food is made up of beneficial nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“If you create a definition of ultra-processed food that doesn’t consider nutrient density, then you’re going to be grouping dairy products like cheese, flavoured yogurts, even flavoured milk, with things like soda and candy,” said Ms Wagner, the senior vice-president from the International Dairy Foods Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Food companies that make minimally processed foods and don’t rely on synthetic ingredients see an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Earlier in 2025, the Food Integrity Collective, a non-profit, began the “Non-UPF Verified” pilot programme, working with packaged goods companies, including Spindrift sparkling water, to develop a standard that will establish which products get a label declaring them not ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The group, which previously launched the “Non-GMO Project” butterfly label, said it has more than 200 companies on its wait-list for verification once the standard is published this autumn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Mr Jon Silverman, a senior vice-president at Spindrift, said the company has always used real fruit in its beverages, “so this programme provides a clear way to highlight that difference for consumers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The Nova system, developed in Brazil, separates food into four buckets: unprocessed or minimally processed foods like fruits and vegetables; processed culinary ingredients such as butter or sugar; processed foods made through methods such as fermentation or canning, and finally ultra-processed foods, including hot dogs and frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Former FDA commissioner David Kessler filed a petition in August urging the FDA to bypass a definition and instead effectively roll back usage of processed, refined carbohydrates in the US food supply by no longer considering them “generally regarded as safe”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;For example, his petition would target high-fructose corn syrup, flours and starches used in industrial food processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That could be a much faster way to kick a lot of ultra-processed food out of US grocery stores than undergoing a typically years-long regulatory process that would be swayed by industry lobbying, said Mr Jerold Mande, a former senior USDA official and now the chief executive of Nourish Science, a non-profit focused on nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;In July, when the US government began considering creating a definition for processed food, it acknowledged the challenges that the food industry is worried about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“Foods considered to be ultra-processed may also include foods such as whole-grain products or yogurt, which are known to have beneficial effects on health,” US agencies said in materials released at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“It is important therefore to consider unintended consequences of an overly inclusive definition of UPFs that could discourage intake of potentially beneficial foods.” BLOOMBERG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Straits Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNczFBbkZZb0tiR0RQV1NGZlpObjZHVjBuekZxY0RMTGxpU2hWTXFWTXA5RFoxeUwzMXNxVzFRSk05amhySWo5Uk80UlN3VS1ubkJiTHpWd3NJUnlQQ2ttaDV5dU8yblVqekJKcWo2UVM3VnRvM2EwOVBvbTdoUDItaUJ6LW11RFdldEYxZERVN3k5bDRRZlVoWU1VMHBXa3pndXY1enhFSzFaNFRWVnJXU1FB</guid></item><item><title>房客专栏|我是一名心理学家。以下是正念如何帮助您变得更健康。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/18/mindfulness-mental-physical-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YKKKV3QAQFF5BDOINCOOVVBBLA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most people know which lifestyle choices promote good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDJ7QJNTWJHKJEGCQOXKSLEYLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Think regular &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/10/foods-health-benefits-diet/" target="_blank"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;Just 15 months after receiving an award from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for excellence in community water fluoridation, the city of Grayling, Michigan, changed course.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;With little notice or fanfare, council members voted unanimously in May to end Grayling’s decadeslong treatment program. The city shut down the equipment used to deliver the drinking water additive less than two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;Although it already paid for them, the town returned six unopened barrels of the fluoride treatment to the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;Personal choice was the issue, said City Manager Erich Podjaske. “Why are we forcing something on residents and business owners, some of which don’t want fluoride in their water?” he said. He saw arguments for and against treatment in his research, he said, and figured that those who want fluoride can still get it at the dentist or in their toothpaste.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1"&gt;Drinking water fluoridation is widely heralded as a public health triumph, but it’s had critics since it was pioneered 80 years ago in Grand Rapids, about 150 miles southwest of Grayling. While once largely on the fringes, fluoridation skeptics now hold sway in federal, state and local government, and their arguments have seeped into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;Even in the state where the treatment began, communities are backpedaling. And because customer notice requirements are patchy, people may not even know about it when their fluoridation stops.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has called fluoride “industrial waste” and supports an end to community water fluoridation. The head of the Food and Drug Administration said on a newscast that the CDC’s online description of water fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements is “misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;The CDC, which is in the midst of a leadership exodus and staff revolt, and the Environmental Protection Agency are reviewing their respective approaches to fluoride in drinking water. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s administration dismantled the CDC’s Division of Oral Health, which, among other initiatives, provided research and technical assistance on fluoridation. That’s the office that helped present awards for well-run programs like the one in Grayling.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;Since Kennedy was elevated to the nation’s top health post, Utah and Florida became the first states to ban communities from adding fluoride to public drinking water. The Utah ban included measures to make prescription fluoride supplements more accessible — but now, the FDA is moving to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-begins-action-remove-ingestible-fluoride-prescription-drug-products-children-market"&gt;remove certain types of those supplements for children from the market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;Altogether, legislation was introduced this year in at least 21 states to prohibit or roll back provisions related to adding fluoride to public water systems, according to Abby Francl, policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. In addition, citing Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” initiative, Oklahoma’s governor issued an executive order instructing state agencies to cease promotion of fluoridation in the public water supply while it reviews the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;Some local communities across the country opted to stop treatment this year, including at least four in Alabama, the state with the second-lowest number of dentists per resident. Others are debating it. On Michigan’s east side, the medical director of St. Clair County’s health department &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26073651-memorandum-st-clair-county-michigan-june-17-2025/"&gt;urged the agency&lt;/a&gt; to take steps to “prohibit the addition of fluoride” to public water systems. Two Upper Peninsula cities with a shared water system had special council meetings this summer on fluoridation. In Hillsdale, the acting mayor has said that ending fluoridation is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;“I want to reform the water system now that we have RFK in Health and Human Services,” Joshua Paladino told a local paper in November. Paladino added in an email to ProPublica that he sees public water fluoridation as an imprecise tool because it gives a standard dose across the population.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;According to Michigan’s environmental agency, some communities had temporarily stopped fluoridation and were “hesitant to restart because of uncertainty.” That prompted it to &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Documents/Programs/DWEHD/Community-Water-Supply/Correspondence/Memo-2025-03-20-Floridation-of-Public-Drinking-Water.pdf?rev=ffe34c06d888439cb3cb81ec79cc8ed6"&gt;issue a five-page statement&lt;/a&gt; with the state health department in March, stressing that the levels recommended for water suppliers — 0.7 milligrams per liter of water — have no adverse health effects and that fluoridation benefits everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;“Local anti-fluoride movements can be vocal and persistent, but do not necessarily represent the viewpoints of the greater community,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;Communities that end fluoridation will see more decaying teeth, according to Margherita Fontana, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. Young children, older adults, people with disabilities and people who are poor are especially at risk, she said, but everyone will be vulnerable. Excessive tooth decay in children can require treatment in hospitals, under anesthesia. In rare but extreme cases, &lt;a href="https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/death-from-a-toothache-the-story-of-deamonte-driver-and-where-we-stand-today-in-ensuring-access-to-dental-health-care-for-children-in-the-district/"&gt;it can lead to death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;“It’s unfortunate, because we know how to prevent the disease,” Fontana said. “So it just seems like we’re going backwards in time rather than forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;A handful of states require customer notification when fluoridation ends. New York mandates such notice, yet &lt;a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/buffalo-water-customers-without-fluoride-for-nearly-a-decade-report-shows"&gt;fluoridation in Buffalo lapsed&lt;/a&gt; for years before it was widely known. Outside Detroit, the city of Wyandotte suspended treatment about a decade ago, despite saying on its website until early this summer that it used fluoride. The claim was removed &lt;a href="https://planetdetroit.org/2025/06/fluoride-levels-in-wyandotte/"&gt;only after a local reporter raised the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;Michigan doesn’t have a statewide protocol for notifying residents when fluoridation stops. The environmental agency’s spokesperson said in an email that while it strongly recommends that communities inform customers, it doesn’t have the authority to compel them.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;Grayling’s water operator, Josh Carlson, said a district engineer at the agency told him he just needed to tell the state if the town decided to stop fluoridating the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1"&gt;“It was almost like she was caught off guard that we actually did it,” Carlson said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;h3&gt;From Fringe to Mainstream&lt;/h3&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;Water fluoridation began in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan’s second-largest city, as part of a planned trial intended to last 15 years. Muskegon, on the Lake Michigan shore, served as the control, meaning its water was not treated with a fluoride additive. An Illinois city with naturally occurring fluoride in its water was another point of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;Six years in, Muskegon officials withdrew from the trial after determining that the health benefits were so significant, they couldn’t deny treatment any longer to Muskegon’s children. Similar studies elsewhere continued for years, showing positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0"&gt;“It was very usual to have dentures at a very young age” at the time, Fontana said. Fluoride treatment “was such a fantastic discovery, something so easy that nature already provided. It was already there. It was the greatest discovery, really, for oral health.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;Grand Rapids celebrates its role in public health history with plaques and a totemic sculpture. But the treatment has been criticized since the early days as, variously, a Communist plot, forced mass medication and an industrial byproduct that causes more harm than good. (Fluoride additives are commonly derived from the processing of phosphate fertilizer.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;Even as fluoridation became widespread, opposition persisted. Today’s critics note that fluoride is now available in toothpaste, as well as in ingestible drops and tablets like the ones for children that the FDA is working to remove from the marketplace. Dental care is also more accessible than it was in the 1940s. The need that fluoridated water was meant to address, critics say, isn’t as urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;While progress has made fluoridation’s effects less dramatic, they’re still significant. It was initially credited with a 65% reduction in tooth decay; now, it’s about 25%. No other fluoride source compares to the cost-effectiveness of drinking water, proponents say, especially for those least able to access dental care, either because of cost or because they live in areas with a shortage of dental providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;Community water fluoridation is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Dental Association and the American Medical Association. The CDC, at least for the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html"&gt;still recommends it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;Advocates say that its benefits are so pervasive, they’ve become invisible to many.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;“Known benefits that are not visible, they take it for granted, whereas unknown risks are what they are always worried about,” said Jayanth Kumar, lead researcher on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120936/"&gt;a systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of community water fluoridation and IQ. “Florida didn’t ban alcohol. Florida didn’t ban cigarettes. But they banned fluoride.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Critics say the National Toxicology Program’s &lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/research/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride"&gt;“state of the science” report&lt;/a&gt; from last year shows an association between fluoridated drinking water and a lowered IQ in children. But that assessment — which is both contested and much-cited — involves fluoride levels that are more than twice what the federal government recommends for drinking water, and it’s based on limited studies conducted outside the U.S., with different water conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;Even the &lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/publications/monographs/mgraph08"&gt;report’s abstract&lt;/a&gt; says that “more studies are needed to fully understand the potential for lower fluoride exposure to affect children’s IQ.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;In a lawsuit brought against the EPA by groups opposed to water fluoridation, a district judge relied in part on the NTP analysis in ruling that fluoridation presents such an “unreasonable risk” that the agency must take action. Even as it appeals the decision, the EPA said its review of new science on fluoride in drinking water “is being done in &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-will-expeditiously-review-new-science-fluoride-drinking-water"&gt;coordination with Secretary Kennedy and HHS&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"&gt;The court ruling, the NTP report and the wavering stance of federal agencies have empowered a backlash to fluoridation in state and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;Stuart Cooper, executive director of the Fluoride Action Network, said he’s seen momentum shift over the last two decades as his group sought to eliminate fluoride treatment, not least as a plaintiff in the EPA lawsuit. Kennedy has given a jolt to the movement, he said. Now, “we have allies at every level.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;“Legislators and city councilors are calling us instead of me having to do vice versa,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tooth Decay and Regrets&lt;/h3&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0"&gt;In Grayling, questions about fluoridation were brewing for at least a year before the town changed course. Podjaske, the city manager, said he discussed it off and on with Carlson, the city’s water operator. When it came time to reorder the fluoride additive, Podjaske wondered: Is this really necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0"&gt;Carlson asked the state’s environmental agency about the protocol for discontinuing treatment and was told to keep the state posted. In April, Podjaske suggested adding the fluoridation question to the City Council’s agenda. At the May meeting, the council voted 4-0 to end treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0"&gt;“I figured the best option was don’t push it on people,’’ council member Jack Pettyjohn said about his vote. “Don’t force them to have it in their water.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0"&gt;There wasn’t any outreach to the public or health experts ahead of the vote. Meeting minutes say that Podjaske and Carlson discussed the removal of the fluoride additive after the water operator received “additional education and training.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0"&gt;But both men say that isn’t right. Fluoridation was already on the agenda when Carlson attended a training that wasn’t about the treatment, but where he had an informal conversation with an instructor that made him worry about fluoride’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0"&gt;The vote would’ve occurred even without Kennedy’s activism, Podjaske and Pettyjohn said. Carlson, though, noted how Grayling’s pivot played out in context of “some of the new narratives coming out of Washington.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0"&gt;“There’s a lot of mixed feelings about RFK Jr., but he seems to be anti-fluoride,” Carlson said. “I don’t know if that’s driving people’s complaints about fluoride.” With the proliferation of social media, he said, “I could see that being a factor, in the fact there’s more people with an opinion now.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0"&gt;At the same time, he said, locals are more tuned in to water issues following &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/flint-michigan-water-crisis-ten-years-after"&gt;the Flint water crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the contamination of waterways with PFAS chemicals linked to a nearby military base. &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-epa-pfas-drinking-water"&gt;PFAS are a group of “forever chemicals”&lt;/a&gt; that can carry a cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0"&gt;Carlson said that in the occasional feedback he’s gotten on fluoridation over the last couple of decades, “the negatives were more than the positives in recent years.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0"&gt;Following input from the state environmental agency, &lt;a href="https://www.cityofgrayling.org/citynews.asp?aid=432"&gt;Grayling posted a notice about the change online&lt;/a&gt; in August, 10 weeks after treatment stopped. Some people didn’t see it. Mary Bobenmoyer, owner and general manager of Our Town Coffee &amp;amp; Treats, didn’t know until a reporter asked her about it in late August. “They did it?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0"&gt;Bobenmoyer spent seven years as a dental assistant. She encourages children especially to get fluoride treatment at the dentist. But, she said, “I personally don’t think it should be filtered in our water. We should have free and clear water.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0"&gt;Over in Grand Rapids, there’s sporadic pushback on fluoridation, said water system manager Wayne Jernberg. But he hasn’t noticed any recent escalation. And he doesn’t see why there would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.1"&gt;“We rely on the science of us,” Jernberg said. “We’ve been adding it for 80 years, OK? And we don’t see any issues in our community.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.2"&gt;Meanwhile, reports on dental health have caused some communities that dropped fluoridation to reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"&gt;In Canada, just across the river from Detroit, the City Council of Windsor, Ontario, voted to stop fluoridation in 2013 after lengthy public debate. Less than six years later, the county health agency reported troubling outcomes from oral health screenings at area schools. It found that the percentage of children with decay or requiring urgent care increased 51% in five years, while the percentage of children that didn’t require any care decreased by 43%. The Windsor council soon decided to reintroduce water fluoridation, citing it as “a key prevention strategy.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.1"&gt;In the province of Alberta, Calgary’s council voted in 2011 to stop fluoridation in part because of community skepticism and because expensive repairs to the equipment were needed, according to Councillor Gian-Carlo Carrà. But in time, researchers found that &lt;a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/news/calgary-childrens-dental-health-getting-worse-without-community-water-fluoridation"&gt;local children developed significantly more cavities&lt;/a&gt; than their peers in Edmonton, where water is fluoridated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0"&gt;“We saved ourselves some money,” said Carrà. “Fast-forward 10 years, and the results are clear that dental outcomes for Calgarians are worse after 10 years of not having fluoride in the water.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.1"&gt;When fluoridation was put on the ballot in 2021, 62% of voters supported its reintroduction. It took more than 28 million Canadian dollars and several years to start treatment again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.2"&gt;But, Carrà said, those costs — and the money to run the system — seem worthwhile. “I’m just much more interested in doing as much good as I possibly can,” Carrà said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0"&gt;In Grayling, speaking more than two months after voting to end the treatment, Pettyjohn said he has an open mind about the future of fluoridation. “I would totally look at readdressing it, especially if the people of Grayling really wanted us to,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0"&gt;For now, though, he said he’s heard nothing negative from residents.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
        
    &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            

&lt;p&gt;A form of vitamin B3 that can be purchased in pharmacies may curb the risk of certain skin cancers among people who have already had the disease, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long recommended the supplement, known as nicotinamide, for people with a history of skin cancer. Previous studies suggested it could help protect cells from UV radiation damage and that people taking it were less likely to see their skin cancer recur.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;But nicotinamide’s full impact has been difficult to measure because it is sold over the counter in pharmacies and health shops, meaning health databases haven’t captured whether people are taking the supplement or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That prompted researchers to analyse data from nearly 34,000 patients in the US Veterans Affairs system, which treats military veterans and their families. More than 12,000 patients were prescribed 500 milligrams of nicotinamide supplements twice daily for at least a month.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Patients taking nicotinamide saw a 14 per cent lower risk of developing skin cancer. The risks were even lower for people who had skin cancer previously (54 per cent) and for a common form of skin cancer known as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2838591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAMA Dermatology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;The findings could change the way doctors discuss the supplement with their patients, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are no guidelines for when to start treatment with nicotinamide for skin cancer prevention in the general population,” Dr Lee Wheless, one of the study’s authors and an assistant professor of dermatology and medicine at Vanderbilt University, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results would really shift our practice from starting it once patients have developed numerous skin cancers to starting it earlier,” Wheless added.&lt;/p&gt;
  


&lt;p&gt;Notably, the study also homed in on more than 1,300 patients who had weakened immune systems after undergoing organ transplants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did not see a significant reduction in their skin cancer risk after taking nicotinamide, though taking the supplement early on was tied to a lower risk of skin cancer known as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still need to do a better job of identifying who will actually benefit [from nicotinamide], as roughly only half of patients will develop multiple skin cancers,” Wheless said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOZFiX6hDXQ" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Simple 15-Minute Habit to Help Regulate &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt; After Meals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/strong&gt; is crucial for overall health, especially for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. High &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; after meals can lead to various health complications, including fatigue, increased thirst, and long-term damage to organs. Fortunately, there's a simple, effective habit you can incorporate into your daily routine to help regulate your &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels: a 15-minute walk after eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a 15-Minute Walk Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging in a short walk after meals offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to better &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this habit works and why it's so effective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Muscle Activation and Glucose Uptake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you walk, your muscles contract. This contraction requires energy, which is primarily derived from &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; in your bloodstream. As your muscles work, they pull &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; from the blood, effectively lowering &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Improved Insulin Sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity, even in small doses, can improve your body's sensitivity to &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Insulin&lt;/strong&gt; is a hormone that helps &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; enter your cells for energy. When you're &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; resistant, your cells don't respond well to &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to elevated &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt;. A post-meal walk can enhance &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; sensitivity, making it easier for &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; to be utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking promotes healthy digestion. It helps move food through your digestive system more efficiently, reducing the likelihood of &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; spikes caused by rapid absorption of nutrients. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="./warning-signs-of-low-blood-sugar-hypoglycemia-and-what-to-do-y9q07b.html"&gt;Warning Signs Of Low Blood Sugar Hypoglycemia And What To Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Stress Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is a well-known stress reliever. Stress hormones can raise &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels, so incorporating a relaxing walk after meals can help counteract this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Weight Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent physical activity contributes to weight management. Maintaining a healthy weight is directly linked to better &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Example:&lt;/strong&gt; A study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals who walked for 15 minutes after each meal experienced better &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control compared to those who walked for 45 minutes at once. This suggests that the timing of exercise is as important as the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Implement the 15-Minute Post-Meal Walk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this habit a part of your daily routine is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Choose a Time and Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select a time that works best for you after each meal. Whether it's after breakfast, lunch, or dinner (or all three!), consistency is key. Find a safe and accessible location for your walk. This could be around your neighborhood, in a park, or even indoors if the weather is unfavorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Set a Reminder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your phone, calendar, or a simple sticky note to remind yourself to take a walk after eating. Creating a visual cue can help you stay on track, especially when you're first establishing the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Start Slowly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not used to regular physical activity, start with a gentle pace and gradually increase your speed as you become more comfortable. The goal is to engage your muscles and elevate your heart rate slightly, not to exhaust yourself. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="./unlocking-blood-sugar-balance-for-sustainable-weight-loss-iykdsd.html"&gt;Unlocking Blood Sugar Balance For Sustainable Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Make it Enjoyable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to your favorite music, a podcast, or an audiobook during your walk. Walking with a friend or family member can also make the experience more enjoyable and help you stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Track Your Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a fitness tracker or a simple notebook to record your walks. Monitoring your progress can provide a sense of accomplishment and encourage you to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Sample Walking Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;| Meal      | Time of Walk   | Location            | Notes                                      |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Breakfast | 8:00 AM        | Around the block    | Listen to a podcast                         |
| Lunch     | 1:00 PM        | Local park          | Walk with a colleague                         |
| Dinner    | 7:00 PM        | Neighborhood streets | Enjoy a relaxing stroll after a busy day |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Science Behind Post-Meal Exercise and &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies support the benefits of post-meal exercise for &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; management. Here are a few key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study 1: "Postprandial Walking Improves &lt;strong&gt;Glycemic Control&lt;/strong&gt; in Type 2 Diabetes"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, published in &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrated that taking a short walk after meals significantly reduced postprandial (after-meal) &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; spikes in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The researchers concluded that this simple intervention could be an effective strategy for managing &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study 2: "The Effect of Exercise Timing on Postprandial &lt;strong&gt;Glycemia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Insulinemia&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sports Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, this study compared the effects of exercising before and after meals. The results indicated that post-meal exercise was more effective at reducing &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study 3: "Effects of Low and Moderate Intensity Exercise on Postprandial &lt;strong&gt;Glucose&lt;/strong&gt; Levels"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research, featured in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, found that even low-intensity exercise, such as a leisurely walk, could significantly improve &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control after meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Benefits Beyond &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt; Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to regulating &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels, a 15-minute post-meal walk can offer a range of other health benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Improved Heart Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity is known to improve cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure, reducing cholesterol levels, and strengthening the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. This can help reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Better Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent physical activity can improve sleep quality. A post-meal walk can help you wind down after dinner and prepare your body for a restful night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Increased Energy Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem counterintuitive, physical activity can actually increase your energy levels. A short walk can help combat the afternoon slump and leave you feeling more alert and energized. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="./how-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-cgm-can-revolutionize-your-health-83zbwz.html"&gt;How A Continuous Glucose Monitor Cgm Can Revolutionize Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Stronger Bones and Muscles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking is a weight-bearing exercise that helps strengthen bones and muscles. This can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and improve overall mobility and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Concerns and Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a 15-minute post-meal walk is generally safe and beneficial, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Individual Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have underlying health conditions. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual needs and medical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Adjusting to Your Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to your body and adjust the intensity and duration of your walks as needed. If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop and rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Weather Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of weather conditions and dress appropriately. Avoid walking in extreme heat or cold, and take necessary precautions to stay safe and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Footwear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear comfortable, supportive shoes to prevent foot pain and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay hydrated by drinking water before, during, and after your walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: A Small Step for a Big Impact on &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating a 15-minute walk after meals is a simple yet powerful habit that can significantly improve your &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control and overall health. By activating your muscles, improving &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; sensitivity, enhancing digestion, reducing stress, and aiding in weight management, this small change can make a big difference. Start today and experience the many benefits of this easy-to-implement strategy. Your &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; will thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

There has never been a more socially acceptable time to be middle-aged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A quick medical primer: &lt;b&gt;Perimenopause&lt;/b&gt; is the transition into menopause. It often starts in the mid-40s, though it can begin earlier. Thereâ€™s a bouillabaisse of symptoms as hormones fluctuate, from night sweats and hot flashes to erratic periods, weight gain, and mood swings. &lt;b&gt;Menopause&lt;/b&gt; is when youâ€™ve gone 12 months without a period. Some call this reverse puberty; my colleague Brooke Hauser calls it an &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/15/magazine/entering-my-punk-perimenopause/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/15/magazine/entering-my-punk-perimenopause/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;emotional mosh pit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My generation didnâ€™t invent this timeless passage â€” about 1.3 million women enter menopause every year â€” but weâ€™re the first to be so vocal about it. Women feel more comfortable sharing symptoms and asking for relief. Companies are taking notice and adding workplace benefits to help employees manage symptoms. For years, treatment was plagued by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/magazine/menopause-hot-flashes-hormone-therapy.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.mFtz.0ZjGpfGrLDqA&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/magazine/menopause-hot-flashes-hormone-therapy.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.mFtz.0ZjGpfGrLDqA&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;flawed research&lt;/a&gt;, connecting hormone therapy to elevated health risks. Finally, these &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/well/menopause-myths.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.aFZt.AwrNqllwEXFL&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/well/menopause-myths.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.aFZt.AwrNqllwEXFL&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;myths are being dispelled&lt;/a&gt;, with meaningful consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;States are taking action. This summer, Rhode Island became the first state to require employers to provide &lt;a href="https://rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/15/ril.pressrelease.inputform/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;amp;ID=375783" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;workplace accommodations&lt;/a&gt; for job applicants and employees experiencing menopause and menopause-related medical conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Maine enacted a law that &lt;a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2555074/governor-janet-mills-signs-menopause-bill-backed-by-halle-berry" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2555074/governor-janet-mills-signs-menopause-bill-backed-by-halle-berry"&gt;requires enhanced training&lt;/a&gt; for medical professionals and more accessible treatment options for women. California and New Jersey have &lt;a href="https://a21.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250409-papan-legislation-enhance-physician-training-menopause-approved-assembly" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://a21.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250409-papan-legislation-enhance-physician-training-menopause-approved-assembly"&gt;similar legislation&lt;/a&gt; pending. Five states introduced legislation that would mandate insurance coverage for menopause care; Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed &lt;a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1776784" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1776784"&gt;that stateâ€™s bill&lt;/a&gt; into law in July.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In Illinois, Oct. 12-18 is now &lt;a href="https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=25&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=SJR&amp;amp;SessionID=114&amp;amp;GA=104" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Menopause Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/health/menopause-bills-wellness" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/health/menopause-bills-wellness"&gt;recently passed bill&lt;/a&gt;. (A similar bill, introduced in Nevada, would have designated October as Menopause Awareness Month, but was vetoed by Governor Joe Lombardo, who has clearly never dealt with night sweats.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last year, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts launched an &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/13/metro/menopause-perimenopause-hot-flash-millennials/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/13/metro/menopause-perimenopause-hot-flash-millennials/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;online support group&lt;/a&gt; specifically for employees experiencing perimenopause and menopause. Local tech startups are capitalizing on the shift. Here in Boston, Embr Labs is designing a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/09/business/innovation-beat-age-tech-startups/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/09/business/innovation-beat-age-tech-startups/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;wristband&lt;/a&gt; to help cool body temperature for women experiencing hot flashes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;What your grandmother used to call â€œthe changeâ€� has even become a cottage industry for influencers, luxury resorts, and food products. Why not &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/22/lifestyle/wellness-travel-yoga-massages/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/22/lifestyle/wellness-travel-yoga-massages/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;travel to the Maldives&lt;/a&gt; for menopause therapy? Or rearrange your social media feeds to follow charismatic &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/01/lifestyle/peri-menopause-menopause-travel/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/01/lifestyle/peri-menopause-menopause-travel/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;physician influencers such as Mary Claire Haver&lt;/a&gt;, who share intel on supplements and nutrition, making middle-age appear almost covetable?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And lest we forget that muscle mass takes a dive during menopause, itâ€™s important to boost our protein intake. For more on this trend, check out my pal Beth Teitellâ€™s meaty dive into the topic: â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/15/lifestyle/protein-needs-grams/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Protein mania: Why everyoneâ€™s eating like a linebacker now&lt;/a&gt;.â€� (She also has interesting things to say about &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/25/lifestyle/weighted-vests-middle-age-fitness/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;weighted vests&lt;/a&gt;, an accessory I have yet to try. Maybe for my next birthday.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Of course, some charlatans want to exploit the menopause momentum. Scams abound, so much so that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/menopause-misinformation-is-everywhere-heres-how-to-detect-it" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;primer&lt;/a&gt; on how to detect menopause misinformation, with warnings about the proliferation of unregulated dietary supplements and TikTok influencers who tout hormone therapy without the proper credentials. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for me: Iâ€™ve written about how &lt;a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2025/01/29/everything-to-know-perimenopause/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/a&gt; I sometimes feel by the barrage of medical advice cluttering my social media feeds. Itâ€™s tempting to wonder if my limp hair is from perimenopause or cheap shampoo. Sometimes I question whether Iâ€™m screaming at my kids due to fluctuating hormones or because nobody in my house can put away their shoes. Often, I sit and wonder: Could an estrogen patch make all my problems melt away?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But, like anything else, itâ€™s complicated. Women need to be discerning consumers. Whatâ€™s right for your friend with night sweats might not be best for you with erratic periods. Commercialization is a risk whenever an issue finally gets mainstream attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But perimenopause and menopause are more than trends, and we have to separate the hormones from the hype. If I ever get a straight eight hours of sleep again, I just might have the brainpower to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;ðŸ§© &lt;b&gt;3 Down:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/games/mini-crossword/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/games/mini-crossword/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;Saturate (with)&lt;/a&gt; | â˜�ï¸� &lt;b&gt;76Â°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/17/metro/new-england-boston-forecast/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Cloudy but warm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. It disrupts your digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee doesn’t just wake up the brain – it wakes up your gut too,” says Sanders. “Caffeine stimulates digestive hormones, speeding things along in the colon. It’s why so many people get that familiar urge to head to the loo after their first coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another compound in coffee, chlorogenic acid, triggers the “gastrocolic reflex” – a wave of movement that propels food through the gut. If you’re prone to digestive issues, this can set off symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/worst-foods-ibs/"&gt;People with IBS&lt;/a&gt; often find coffee worsens cramps, urgency or diarrhoea, and it can aggravate inflammatory bowel disorder,” says Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can also worsen heartburn. Caffeine stimulates stomach acid and relaxes the valve at the top of the stomach, increasing your risk of reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to avoid an upset stomach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If reflux or cramps are an issue, avoid drinking coffee on an empty stomach. “Try a smaller size or cold brew, which tends to be less acidic and better tolerated,” says Suresh. “If symptoms flare consistently, reduce your intake or switch to decaf to see if caffeine is the trigger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;6. It messes with your medication&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine can interact with many medicines,” says pharmacist Deborah Grayson, a specialist in drug-nutrient interaction. “It can amplify or counteract a drug’s action, or alter how it’s processed in the liver, leading to higher levels and increased risk of side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high caffeine intake may impair blood-thinners, like warfarin, by reducing platelets’ ability to clot, says Grayson. And drinking coffee within an hour of taking thyroid medication, levothyroxine, can reduce its absorption by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take care with over-the-counter remedies too. Cold and flu remedies often contain stimulants such as pseudoephedrine, which raise heart rate and blood pressure and may disrupt sleep. “Caffeine can amplify these effects, so it should be used sparingly or avoided,” says Grayson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is added to many painkillers to increase their effectiveness, and drinking coffee may ramp them up further. “However, for some people, the extra caffeine may increase risk of gastritis or stomach bleeds, and also increase the risk of heartburn and indigestion,” says Grayson. “This risk is highest with aspirin, though it can also occur with paracetamol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to make sure your medication isn’t effected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, one or two coffees a day is safe with common medications,” says Grayson. “But keep a one-to-two-hour gap between taking them and drinking coffee and consult your GP or pharmacist if you’re unsure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;7. It exposes you to microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by researchers at the University of Birmingham found take-away coffee from high-street chains contains substantial levels of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/skin/health-risks-forever-chemicals/"&gt;microplastics – tiny fragments of plastic, shed from packaging&lt;/a&gt;, that can accumulate in the body and may harm health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Birmingham tested 155 hot and cold popular drinks, from supermarkets and cafés. Coffee ranked second highest (after tea) at 43 microplastic particles (MPs) per litre. The main source? Single-use cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to avoid microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re grabbing coffee on the go, take a reusable cup,” says Erica Cirino at the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/"&gt;Plastic Pollution Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. “Choose stainless steel, ceramic or glass, and avoid plastic lids. At home, use ceramic or stainless-steel equipment and recycled-paper filters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS recommends adults stick below 400mg of caffeine a day. For pregnant women, it’s below 200mg a day. Caffeine levels vary widely according to the size and blend of your coffee. Here’s a quick guide from dietitian Bini Suresh.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;Metformin&lt;/a&gt; has been prescribed to people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to manage blood sugar for more than 60 years, but scientists haven't been exactly sure how it works. A new study suggests it works directly in the brain, which could lead to new types of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine in the US, identifies a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"&gt;brain pathway&lt;/a&gt; that the drug seems to work through, in addition to the effects it has on biological processes in other areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1120781"&gt;in the liver&lt;/a&gt;," says Makoto Fukuda, a pathophysiologist at Baylor. "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13128.x"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that it acts through the gut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/10-key-reasons-dementia-is-linked-with-diabetes"&gt;10 Key Reasons Dementia Is Linked With Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.142545"&gt;Previous work&lt;/a&gt; by some of the same researchers had identified a protein in the brain called Rap1 as having an impact on glucose metabolism, particularly in a part of the brain called the ventromedial hypothalamus or (VMH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174579" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph.jpg" alt="Metformin injection chart" class="wp-image-174579 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph-425x415.jpg 425w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph-600x586.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174579" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Direct brain injections of metformin lowered blood glucose in mice. (Lin et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, tests on mice showed metformin traveling to the VMH, where it helps tackle &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by essentially turning off Rap1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers bred mice without Rap1, metformin then had no impact &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-new-form-of-diabetes-is-officially-recognized"&gt;on a diabetes-like condition&lt;/a&gt; – even though other drugs did. It's strong evidence that metformin works in the brain, through a different mechanism than other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was also able to take a close look at the specific neurons metformin was changing activity in. Further down the line, that could lead to more targeted treatments that take aim at these neurons specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin's effects," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/how-does-metformin-lower-blood-sugar"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Fukuda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they're directly involved in the drug's action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-metformin-a-wonder-drug-202109222605"&gt;Metformin is safe&lt;/a&gt;, long-lasting, and relatively affordable. It works by reducing the glucose produced by the liver and increasing how efficiently the body uses insulin, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-restricted-eating-helps-control-blood-sugar-in-type-2-diabetes"&gt;manage the symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know it very probably works through the brain, as well as the liver and the gut. Clearly, this needs to be shown in human studies as well, but once that's established, we might be able to find ways to boost metformin's effects and make it more potent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also ties into other interesting studies that have found the same drug can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-medication-slows-brain-aging-in-monkeys"&gt;slow brain aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-drug-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;improve lifespan&lt;/a&gt;. With a better understanding of how metformin works, we may see it used for a broader range of purposes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery changes how we think about metformin," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/how-does-metformin-lower-blood-sugar"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Fukuda. "It's not just working in the liver or the gut, it's also acting in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu3700"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_2 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My aunt has suffered some serious physical and mental health issues in her life. She lost a child at birth, and another to a tragic accident that also gravely injured her husband. She has suffered from depression, which isn’t surprising, considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is the kindest, sweetest human and an amazing mom to her other two children. She also works full-time and is beloved in her office. She was forced into menopause after a surgery she needed and is suffering from terrible symptoms. She has awful hot flashes where she starts dripping sweat and doesn’t sleep from night sweats and other common menopausal sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research and suggested she speak to her doctor about Hormone Replacement Therapy. But she’s afraid of the side effects. How can I get her to at least talk to someone and get all the information necessary to make the right decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweaty Auntie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_3 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend was recently sharing information with me about how hot flashes come about. My research shows that hot flashes are caused by the lack of estrogen during menopause, which disrupts the hypothalamus, otherwise known as the brain’s thermostat. In other words, your brain starts to overheat and sends messages to your body on how to cool down, which includes sweating so the moisture can then cool you from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HRT can be helpful to alleviate hot flashes and night sweats, but it does come with some risk and doesn’t work for everyone depending on many factors. Tell your auntie that though it may not work for her, and may cause headaches, nausea and other side effects, prolonged hot flashes can affect her quality of life and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book her an appointment with her doctor and accompany her so you can ensure she gets all of the information. In the end, it’s her decision alone to make. But I’m certain she’ll appreciate your care and concern.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_2 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband is an exceptional cook and really enjoys it. However, he rarely accepts help in the kitchen, has trouble with executive functioning skills such as time management, and dinner is almost always an hour later than planned. On top of that, no matter how good anything tastes, he is dissatisfied with the outcome and blankets the meal with his own disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I get out from under this dark cloud? And how do I help him see that none of it is healthy other than the meal itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not Good Enough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_3 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your husband sounds very insecure and self-deprecating. Those are HIS problems, but they influence you. It’s hard to be with someone who is constantly negative. Not to state the obvious, but do you give him positive feedback about the food he’s created?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe your husband would benefit from some professional help. He may be experiencing anhedonia, which is defined as “the inability to experience pleasure from activities that are normally enjoyable and rewarding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you could try to help him out by discussing the meal with him in advance. Say, for example, he’s making a lasagna. You could help him by preboiling the pasta, chopping the mushrooms, grating the cheese, etc. That could help with the time management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, while eating, you could discuss the meal in detail, as in, on a scale of 1-10, where does this fall for you, and where does it fall for me, and why. Deconstruct, make notes and recreate the dish. Once it gets to a 10, he can’t possibly complain. If he does, you could point out the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_4 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEEDBACK&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding the old friends who are now enemies (June 10):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader –&lt;/strong&gt; “The most logical explanation for the boyfriend's sister reacting in that manner is for some reason, she really, REALLY doesn't want her brother dating her now-former friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone needs to ask the sister why she doesn't want her brother dating her old friend.  It might be protectiveness, but it's also possible that there is someone else waiting in the wings that the sister wants to match him up with, even if he’s not interested in this hypothetical other person and never will be.  So, she's being rude to chase her old friend off.  Like some fantasy fairy tale in the former friend's head that she desperately wants manifested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mental and personality issues can manifest during the college years, which may explain why she changed so much since they saw each other last.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_4 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader #2 –&lt;/strong&gt; “Some people get downright weird about their siblings dating their friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
