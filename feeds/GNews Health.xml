These compounds act as strong antioxidants, helping protect cells from DNA damage and oxidative stress, which are major triggers for cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oncologist also points out that these tubers are a staple in the “blue zones”, regions of the world where people live the longest with low levels of chronic disease. Dr. Mussallem recommends a simple approach: steam, bake, or lightly roast them to enjoy their natural sweetness while maximizing their anti-cancer benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxNbENmYmlKVnREUWFXVUlnc25wRDl4QjRkLUhjTHFuRHRJeks5WmladTI3ZDNjU2YzeHhZajNCUS0tcWdGQTZqcktxVENhZnpEeGZyZ1NFQW5nZWJFay1qVHI5Z0h6SXc5bmdFMVhuT2RsS0Y0QnB2S0d5dGFqcTRfTklUclNHUm9ZX3hJM2stRWJJZXNZV1hFam9PNWVWcUVKVGVSd2x2TXBtUlV3OEZfRFpzWm5ZVFMzdndvSzJFa2d0Y1hVU2EtMWl3dTBjSFJwV0JSOW1aWVRMUGlLbXdiMHB2YlJKaXZEOWVRaTljUTRuYXhGM0ZJ0gH_AUFVX3lxTFBNSjhKZHIyVkU2Sndvd3VDSklKbXpHaEVkVW9INDNMUjctak5sNzBseE9HMHh6WEVkLUd1SEpWSlJNQVdneExJY3UxczBhZW8ySGpYYjFqVThoR2tpdWUzWXg2bEY3UnlzUmwzM09WRVp6a3p3Y1BPU1RGLUNfbGxjNFdBQ0Z2WEl6Vm5jMFdScjgwNDlVNE03QkdKWXRJaWNtSXhCTVlZVUNGclBJbllCV1BCbzFHMWdIREN4MTV5eE94eFp0UTJKU2VjTWJiREJpX1ZYUlhVMS1uZUhuQlZKRjRlMV9zN3o1bC1Ed1lQeklETWpJU1FVWDJrdmtaTQ</guid></item><item><title>印度研究发现音乐可帮助患者在麻醉下愈合- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c231dv9zpz3o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 gXJgDY"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 gqeTMs"&gt;Soutik Biswas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 bIfajQ"&gt;India correspondent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6712/live/6ce97290-c89b-11f0-bd7c-1744b857cc58.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC A patient with headphones playing music during surgery in a hospital in Delhi" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;A patient with headphones playing music during surgery in a hospital in Delhi&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Under the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That, at least, is what a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://mmd.iammonline.com/index.php/musmed/article/view/1111" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;new peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, "clear-headed" recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Our aim is early discharge after surgery," says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. "Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Indian surgeons medical team performing surgery in operation theater at hospital" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional "blocks" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm," says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. "We've been doing this for decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia," says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15634083" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Michael Jackson's death&lt;/a&gt; but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. "Propofol acts within about 12 seconds," notes Dr Goel. "We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano," says Dr Husain. "The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. "Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia," the researchers write, "music can still shape the brain's internal state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. "The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious," says Dr Wadhawan. "You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of "intraoperative awareness" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music," says Dr Husain. "It's a way of humanising the operating room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9HWXl4a3FROU5CUFhKOGtCQ1lrWGVSMlZieVZJR3ZjQl9Da2VWUFU4TXdVcTVyS1RCTG5malB1WUtTREJNOUxkS1FnMFNZNTBCcWs2MlZXWldpQdIBX0FVX3lxTE93UlRJRGgxVFFGRmt3aTFwcldZTFdiLU04RjBmSW5qUlhOcmgxRldhNks5SndyWDF6dmpMZ0lTdW5QZkoycE80dFV2Mk1xTjhIOE1RVlhuVTBrVld5dG1z</guid></item><item><title>科学家实现了可能使电池过时的突破： “每天24小时生成” -冷却</title><link>https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/osmotic-power-plant-scaling-up-blue-energy-france/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
					
&lt;p&gt;Just as green energy stocks are beginning to rally, French researchers made an important breakthrough in "blue energy," according to the Institut Polytechnique de Paris' &lt;a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/columns/energy/osmotic-energy-an-asset-for-the-planet/" target="_blank"&gt;Polytechnique insights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, blue energy isn't as well-known or developed as other forms of &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tag/clean-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;clean energy&lt;/a&gt;, like solar and wind. But the outcome of a pilot project in France "could be decisive for the energy transition," the outlet predicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Blue energy" is actually a form of &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/" target="_blank"&gt;green energy&lt;/a&gt;. As its moniker implies, the energy in this equation is derived from water. Also called "osmotic power," the process harnesses energy naturally generated at the interface between &lt;a href="https://www.surfertoday.com/environment/the-fresh-water-meets-sea-water-natural-phenomenon" target="_blank"&gt;freshwater and saltwater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.electrochem.org/what-is-blue-energy" target="_blank"&gt;Electrochemical Society&lt;/a&gt; explained that the innate "pressure" between high-salinity water and freshwater "can be turned into electricity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-144cb76147bc62492e41ef905134cf76 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-144cb76147bc62492e41ef905134cf76"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-0fd3ebd3abb20c37ba7e77361001dd18 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-0fd3ebd3abb20c37ba7e77361001dd18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-ef29fb443a218f95997fae527d14a163 theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-ef29fb443a218f95997fae527d14a163"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-f0c0b1d50ad21f9a8149a6b5a1a9876e theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-f0c0b1d50ad21f9a8149a6b5a1a9876e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-bb9f9f3278b7daf93b60584821018326 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-bb9f9f3278b7daf93b60584821018326"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e53d075d3331eb785d822308d96d87e8 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-e53d075d3331eb785d822308d96d87e8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-36ce3179e1407b2920ad40614e9cb7e7 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-36ce3179e1407b2920ad40614e9cb7e7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The planet naturally makes salt water and fresh water, so we should take advantage of that. It's free energy," ECS Vice Chair Andrew Herring &lt;a href="https://www.electrochem.org/what-is-blue-energy" target="_blank"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-4853e53726ae155fdabbf786525bf9d0 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-4853e53726ae155fdabbf786525bf9d0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Estuaries and deltas are both junctures where freshwater bodies, such as rivers, meet saltwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-838899481" data-theco-trackid="627859" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Their work takes place in the Rhône delta, where the Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Electricity from osmotic energy can be generated 24 hours a day, regardless of weather conditions," Polytechnique insights noted, adding that the infrastructure for osmotic power plants was straightforward compared to similar structures like hydraulic dams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-42ae0056d36b5fef6504cf08e11874bf theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-42ae0056d36b5fef6504cf08e11874bf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Polytechnique insights, Mottet and Bocquet's start-up, Sweetch Energy, commissioned an osmotic power plant capable of generating 4 terawatt-hours (or 1 billion kilowatt-hours) of electricity per year in late 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://earth.org/osmotic-power-the-next-wave-of-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;Earth.org&lt;/a&gt; covered Sweetch Energy's efforts to make osmotic power more accessible within the renewables landscape. The site stated that the duo's breakthroughs could make blue energy a "truly energy-efficient and cost-effective solution" at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-10th-p-carousel theco-target" id="theco-2609309450" data-theco-trackid="603827" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/install-solar-panels/" target="_blank"&gt;installing solar panels&lt;/a&gt; remains the best way for most homeowners to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/lower-your-utility-bills/" target="_blank"&gt;lower utility bills&lt;/a&gt; as clean energy becomes more accessible and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tag/solar-panels/" target="_blank"&gt;Solar panels&lt;/a&gt; can bring household energy bills to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/reddit-solar-panels-negative-bill-home/" target="_blank"&gt;$0 or even lower&lt;/a&gt;, and TCD's &lt;a href="http://links.thecooldown.com/solar-explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Solar Explorer&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that simplifies the process. It matches consumers with competitive quotes from vetted local installers, helping you save up to $10,000 on new installations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-306cf70f7910a407d537b1925cca4b33 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-306cf70f7910a407d537b1925cca4b33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, solar panels have reduced lifetime energy costs but have required upfront investments. The &lt;a href="http://links.thecooldown.com/solar-explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Solar Explorer&lt;/a&gt; offers options for all budgets, including Palmetto's &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/lightreach-home/" target="_blank"&gt;LightReach&lt;/a&gt; solar leasing program, which lets customers lock in low energy rates with no money down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, experts predict that osmotic energy could provide power sufficient to cover "15% of global electricity needs." Mottet and Bocquet believe it could significantly alter the energy landscape by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, researchers have studied both their prevalence in the environment and their impact on it, wildlife, and human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Previous studies have linked microplastics and heart disease. The new research, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025006890#ak005" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Environment International;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Environment International&lt;/a&gt;, drilled down on that connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers studied the effects of microplastics on mice, exposing them to daily levels equivalent to standard human exposure. They determined microplastics "dramatically worsened atherosclerosis" in several of the mice — but only male subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atherosclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; is the medical term for debris, like fats, that accumulate on artery walls, and the press release indicated microplastics exposure worsened that buildup by "63% in the aortic root" and "624% in the brachiocephalic artery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are these findings concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To say something "is everywhere" is typically understood to be &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyperbole" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyperbole;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the unfortunate case of the relatively novel problem of microplastics, it's not an exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics were first discovered by a marine biologist, leading scientists to discover that the oceans are awash in this pervasive form of plastic pollution. However, they're also in the soil, which in turn contaminates the food we grow and the meat we consume. They're also airborne, meaning we breathe microplastic-tainted air indoors and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If microplastics were harmless, this pollution would still be a problem — but in addition to heart disease, traces of the contaminant have been found in human reproductive systems, and research has linked exposure to microplastics to certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever," said lead author Changcheng Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research into microplastics is indeed critical, and new information on how microplastics affect the environment and living organisms is routinely studied and published — but acting on these findings on a global scale takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Individuals can take several steps to reduce their direct exposure to microplastics, even if, as Zhou observed, it is "nearly impossible to avoid microplastics completely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He advised &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/avoid-single-use-items-when-you-travel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:single-use plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;single-use plastic&lt;/a&gt; items, and replacing your most-used things with &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/choose-plastic-free-options-for-everyday-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic-free alternatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt; is also effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Zhou also recommended avoiding plastic water bottles, a major source of microplastic exposure, as well as eschewing &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/ditch-plastic-food-containers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic food containers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic food containers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;��&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get TCD's &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/newsletter/?utm_source=recmzM3sLgAlJogC6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletters&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/rewards-club" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rewards Club;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Rewards Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOVWhuTjk5c0NBbVdkdEJtNU5UQ0RVNFdxSTFZM3U4WXJVeEtGbi15TmlKQmdZa01tLVNVTjJRUmEyRVFzTVRLa0xJTEszZ0JsUVhSQkp1X1lIcWJWalJ4dHFZQkdic203emtDM2RLd1l1RWhBcHlpWjJRVGFBeGkyN2JLd1NhSkp6ejJZZU9CWmJxNGwx</guid></item><item><title>检查为什么一些物种发展出意识而另一些物种保持无意识- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-11-species-consciousness-conscious.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are many different kinds of herpesviruses out there, and some of them can be serious trouble for the animals in our care. Officials are now tracking a growing outbreak of neurological illness that’s spreading among working horses across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) &lt;a href="https://equinediseasecc.org/news/article/Equine-Herpesvirus-Myeloencephalopathy-(EHM)-Outbreak"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; its latest update on the outbreak of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy, or EHM. At least 29 cases of EHM have been identified in seven states so far. The outbreak appears to have originated from a rodeo and racing event held in Texas earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A troublesome virus&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vhc.missouri.edu/equine-hospital/internal-medicine/diseases-and-treatments/equine-herpes-myeloencephalitis/"&gt;EHM&lt;/a&gt; is caused by an infection of the equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EHV-1 is a ubiquitous and highly contagious germ. Most horses catch it at some point in their lives, usually through direct contact with other horses, airborne transmission across short distances, and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or even people’s hands and clothing. Most of the time, EHV-1 only causes acute respiratory illness, after which it goes silent and lies dormant in the body (a feature common to many herpesviruses). But sometimes, the virus can travel to the brain and spinal cord, inflaming blood vessels and triggering dangerous blood clotting, which results in EHM.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;EHM is most often caused by strains of EHV-1 that are more likely to produce the neurological form of infection, but a respiratory strain of EHV-1 can rarely cause EHM as well. The virus can also reactivate from dormancy and spread to the nervous system, triggering EHM.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The outbreak, according to the EDCC, began sometime during the Women’s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) World Finals and Elite Barrel Race event held in Waco between November 5 and 9. Several horses that attended the event developed EHM, prompting a widespread alert from animal health and racing horse officials in several states. Last week, officials &lt;a href="https://thehorse.com/1141043/barrel-futurities-of-america-suspends-oklahoma-event-due-to-ehm-positives/"&gt;chose&lt;/a&gt; to cancel the remainder of the Barrel Futurities of America (BFA) World Championship scheduled to be hosted in Oklahoma after two horses in the state that recently traveled to Waco came down with EHM.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At this point, the potential impact of this outbreak is still unclear, though it could be vast. One of the largest &lt;a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/news/deadly-strain-equine-herpes-virus#:~:text=In%202011%2C%20an%20EHV%2D1/EHM%20outbreak%20at%20the,the%20virus%20to%20at%20least%202%2C106%20horses"&gt;known outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; of EHM/EHV-1 began in 2011 at a cutting horse event in Ogden, Utah, which exposed the virus to roughly 2,000 horses in 19 states, infected at least 90 horses, and killed 13.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The extent of this EHV-1 outbreak is not yet fully known. Presentation of EHV-1 in these horses has been acute with rapid progression and high clinical severity. A concerning number of mortalities in horses suspected to have EHM have been reported,” said the Texas Animal Health Commission in an &lt;a href="https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/2025/2025-11-19_EHM-Waco.pdf"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A known threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As worrying as this outbreak is, most cases of EHM are not fatal, especially with prompt detection and supportive treatment. There is a vaccine for EHV-1, which is used to prevent the respiratory form of the infection and the risk of miscarriage in pregnant horses. Though the vaccine doesn’t directly prevent EHM, it may help curb the spread of outbreaks by reducing the potential viral load of infected horses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, officials are coordinating with the WPRA event sponsors, horse owners who attended the WPRA events, and veterinarians to track and stop the spread of the outbreak. Vets who believe they’ve encountered a potential case are being advised to submit a report to the EDCC.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

The patient was the first person to be diagnosed as having avian flu in the United States since February and the first human ever known to be infected with the H5N5 strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All previous human avian influenza infections had been caused by H5N1 and were relatively mild. However, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/us-reports-first-fatal-h5n1-infection-avian-flu-strikes-more-poultry-cats"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one man died in January&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-dies-complications-avian-influenza"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Little is known about the Washington patient. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;He or she, identified as an older adult with underlying health conditions, had a mixed backyard flock of domestic poultry at home that had exposure to wild birds. Washington state has had dozens of detections of avian flu in wild birds, waterfowl, and backyard poultry in the past weeks, part of a seasonal spike in activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the public remains low. No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk to the public remains low. No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza. Public health officials will continue to monitor anyone who was in close contact with the patient for symptoms to ensure that human-to-human spread has not occurred," officials said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials also said the case is a reminder to get seasonal flu vaccines. "While the seasonal flu vaccine will not prevent bird flu infection, it reduces the risk of becoming sick with both human and avian influenza viruses at the same time. Though unlikely, infection with both viruses could result in the emergence of an avian influenza virus that is more easily transmitted from person to person," the statement said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Indiana poultry facility detections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana is still the epicenter of commercial poultry activity, with 11 detections over the weekend according to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;update&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in the 11 detections are seven commercial duck breeder or broiler production facilities. Indiana is the nation’s largest duck producer. Outbreak sizes range from 23,000 to 2,900 affected birds.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten of the 11 detections in Indiana are in LaGrange County, and the other detection is in Elkhart. Both counties have had several recent detections.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APHIS noted several other poultry outbreaks, including a large commercial turkey outbreak in Edmunds County, South Dakota, affecting 35,400 birds, and a breeder hen facility in Wayne County, North Carolina, with 9,800 birds.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Many view it as a gentle, harmless shortcut to better sleep, especially because it is marketed as a “natural hormone.” Yet patterns of heavy and frequent use are becoming increasingly common, and so are the complaints that follow the next morning. In a widely discussed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRYCSA6CSe8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram video, Dr Kunal Sood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; warned, “When you find out overusing melatonin, especially in high doses, can cause next-day grogginess, vivid dreams and throw you off your natural sleep rhythm.” His statement captures what sleep researchers have been highlighting for years, prompting renewed interest in how melatonin actually behaves inside the body and why some doses may do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What melatonin actually does inside your body&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, and it helps regulate your sleep–wake cycle by rising in the evening and falling as daylight returns. It signals that it is time to wind down, preparing the brain and body for rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, modern living often interferes with this natural rhythm. Bright screens, late-night studying, shift work and erratic routines can suppress natural melatonin release, leaving people feeling out of sync. This is where synthetic melatonin steps in, offering support when the body’s timing feels disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Wake Up at 3:30 AM?

While small doses can gently support the sleep cycle, large or frequent doses can saturate the system, creating effects that spill over into waking hours. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/10/3480" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, rather than nudging the brain into rest, overpowering melatonin levels may blur the boundaries between night and day, which is why some users feel groggy, disoriented or more tired than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Symptoms and side-effects of melatonin misuse&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin can cause a recognisable pattern of symptoms when taken too often or in higher doses than needed. These experiences vary from person to person, but research and user reports show several recurring outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Common symptoms people report include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling unusually sleepy or groggy the next morning, especially if the dose is high or taken late at night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing vivid, intense or unsettling dreams, often tied to melatonin’s influence on REM sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headaches, dizziness or mild nausea shortly after waking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mood changes, including irritability, restlessness or anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating during the day, often described as feeling mentally “slow” or foggy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sense of being out of sync with your natural rhythm, leading to inconsistent sleep timing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these symptoms happen because high melatonin levels remain in the bloodstream for far longer than expected. Some studies show that elevated melatonin can linger for up to ten hours, which explains why the next morning feels unusually heavy for many users. These effects are not usually dangerous on their own, but they are strong indicators that the hormone is being used in a way that conflicts with how the body processes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Risks of long-term or excessive melatonin&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although melatonin is generally considered safe when used in moderation, long-term or excessive use can carry risks that extend beyond temporary grogginess. These risks relate to how melatonin interacts with the brain’s internal clock and how the body responds to prolonged exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Some documented risks include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disruption of the circadian rhythm when melatonin levels stay high for too long, which can disturb regular sleep–wake patterns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impaired alertness or balance the following day, which becomes particularly concerning for driving, working night shifts or handling machinery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential hormonal interference, especially in adolescents, who naturally produce varying melatonin levels as part of development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced sleep quality over time, because overpowering the system can interfere with the brain’s natural signalling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dependency-like behaviour, where people feel unable to sleep without taking melatonin every night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inconsistency in supplement strength due to poor regulation, leading to users unknowingly consuming far higher doses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that chronic high exposure may “flatten” the natural melatonin curve, confusing the internal clock rather than strengthening it. This misalignment can cause ongoing sleep disturbances, making people feel dependent on increasing doses even though the underlying timing issue worsens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Safer ways to use melatonin&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin can be helpful when used thoughtfully, but it works best when treated as a tool rather than a nightly necessity. Dosage, timing and consistency all influence how it affects your sleep, and small adjustments can significantly reduce unwanted effects. “Research shows less than 1 mg often works better than high doses”, says Dr. Sood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safe-use guidance often includes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing the lowest effective dose, since many studies show that less than 1 mg is often enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking melatonin 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime, allowing it to align with your body’s natural rise in hormone levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding daily or long-term use unless guided by a clinician, especially for children, adolescents or older adults&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking for third-party testing to ensure the product contains the stated amount and does not include hidden additives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pairing melatonin with healthy sleep habits, such as reducing screen exposure before bed or maintaining a consistent routine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin should ideally support your sleep system, not replace it. When used sparingly, it can help regulate timing. When used excessively, it can interfere with the very rhythm it is supposed to restore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

Genetic analyses of more than 2,700 deaths revealed that these individuals carry fewer genetic risk factors for major psychiatric conditions compared to those with known suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges long-held assumptions that better depression screening alone will catch most at-risk individuals. The findings point to overlooked biological and environmental pathways that current prevention strategies do not address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Distinct Risk Group:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with no prior suicidality show fewer genetic risk factors for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and related traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Hidden Depression:&lt;/strong&gt; Their genetic profiles suggest they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; simply undiagnosed cases of typical psychiatric illness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Prevention Needs:&lt;/strong&gt; Conventional screening focused on mood disorders may miss this entire subgroup, requiring new approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Utah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Among friends and family of those who die by suicide, a common refrain is: I didn’t know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people who die by suicide have prior attempts, about half of people who die by suicide have no documented suicidal thoughts or behaviors, nor do they have known psychiatric conditions associated with suicide risk, like depression. They have no previous clear indicators that they might be at risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new genetic study at University of Utah found that people in this group of unexpected suicides aren’t just flying under the clinical radar via lower access to psychiatric services—their underlying risk factors may be fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that people who die by suicide without prior non-fatal suicidal thoughts or behaviors have fewer psychiatric diagnoses and also fewer underlying genetic risk factors for psychiatric conditions compared to people who had shown these warning signs before dying by suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of people out there who may be at risk of suicide where it’s not just that you’ve missed that they’re depressed, it’s likely that they’re in fact actually not depressed,” says Hilary Coon, PhD, professor of psychiatry in the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine at the University of Utah and first author on the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is important in widening our view of who may be at risk. We need to start to think about aspects leading to risk in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open,&lt;/em&gt; upend conventional beliefs about suicide risk and suggest new approaches to help save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Uncovering hidden risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other research had shown that people who die by suicide without prior known suicidality are less likely to have psychiatric diagnoses, such as depression, compared to people with documented suicidal thoughts or behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nobody knew the root cause of this difference. Maybe, researchers thought, people without known suicidality are still just as depressed or anxious—they’re just undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Coon’s team was surprised to find that this isn’t the case. Instead, they found that this group has different genetic risk factors from people with known suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comprehensively analyzing anonymized genetic data from more than 2,700 people who died by suicide, the researchers found that people without prior suicidality tend to have fewer genetic risk factors for several psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease, and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic data also suggests that this group isn’t any more likely than the general population to have milder conditions, like depressed mood and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that conventional wisdom on how to reduce suicide may need to be rethought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A tenet in suicide prevention has been that we just need to screen people better for associated conditions like depression,” Coon explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And if people had the same sort of underlying vulnerabilities, then additional efforts in screening might be very helpful. But for those who actually have different underlying vulnerabilities, then increasing that screening might not help for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Helping those most at risk for suicide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to find and treat these “hidden” at-risk individuals is a major focus of Coon’s upcoming research. Previous studies with clinical data have shown potential links between suicide risk and hard-to-treat conditions like chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coon is also investigating how other physical disorders, such as inflammation and respiratory conditions, may impact suicide risk. Her work will also focus on traits that may confer resilience to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coon emphasizes that, on their own, individual genetic risk factors related to suicide have very small effects on risk, and there’s no single gene—or combination of genes—that causes suicide. Environmental and societal contexts are crucial contributors to risk, and understanding the interplay between the environment and underlying biology will be essential to discovering who’s at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our work will begin to define subsets of individuals at risk, and also the contexts in which these risk characteristics may be important,” Coon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people have a certain type of clinical diagnosis that makes them particularly vulnerable within particular environmental contexts, they still may not ever say they’re suicidal. We hope our work may help reveal traits and contexts associated with high risk so that doctors can deliver care more effectively and specifically. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better identification of at-risk individuals will help people get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you need help?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/hmhi/programs/crisis-diversion/988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Call 988&lt;/a&gt; to reach a free, confidential 24/7 support line for suicidal crisis or emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/hmhi/programs/crisis-diversion/crisis-care-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Huntsman Mental Health Institute Crisis Care Center&lt;/a&gt; also offers 24/7 walk-in mental health services for adults.

PGS from the suicide death cohorts were also compared to unselected population controls. Evidence of prior suicidality was determined from diagnoses and clinical notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohort differences in PGS reflecting neuropsychiatric conditions were tested using analysis of covariance, adjusting for sex, age, and genetic ancestry, followed by additional analyses within sex and within subgroups defined by age at death (50 years or younger vs older than 50 years). PGS spanned 12 neuropsychiatric conditions. Data were analyzed between July 2024 and July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD-N cohort (n = 1337) had significantly more male suicide deaths (1105 [82.65%] vs 974 [67.95%]), with an older mean (SD) age at death (47.5 [18.9] vs 41.4 [15.6] years) than the SD-S cohort (n = 1432). The control cohort (n = 19 499) had significantly fewer males (8597 [44.09%]) than both suicide death subsets. Genetic ancestry was similar across the SD-N and SD-S groups (96.77% and 96.81% European ancestry), and control (97.38% European ancestry) groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic status was not significantly different across suicide cohorts adjusted for age and sex (occupation ranking SD-N mean [SD], 57.16 [24.54]; SD-S mean [SD], 54.72 [25.29]; &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; = 1.30; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .70; maximum education SD-N mean [SD], 2.70 [1.12]; SD-S mean [SD], 2.67 [1.13]; Fisher exact test &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing SD-N to SD-S revealed significantly lower (false discovery rate &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .05) PGS in the SD-N group for major depressive disorder (adjusted mean difference, 0.085 [95% CI, 0.018-0.152]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01), depressed affect (adjusted mean difference, 0.081 [95% CI, 0.012-0.149]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .02), anxiety (adjusted mean difference, 0.091 [95% CI, 0.021-0.161]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01), neuroticism (adjusted mean difference, 0.102 [95% CI, 0.033-0.171]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .004), and Alzheimer disease (adjusted mean difference, 0.090 [95% CI, 0.021-0.1658]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01), and lower (false discovery rate &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .10) PGS in SD-N for posttraumatic stress disorder (adjusted mean difference, 0.070 [95% CI, 0.001-0.139]; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .04). Of note, SD-N PGS were not significantly different from controls for depressed affect (adjusted mean difference, 0.037 [95% CI, −0.019 to 0.093]), neuroticism (adjusted mean difference, −0.001 [95% CI, −0.057 to 0.055]), or Alzheimer disease (adjusted mean difference, −0.027 [95% CI, −0.083 to 0.029]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cohort study, SD-N showed significantly different genetic liabilities to neuropsychiatric conditions from SD-S. Results have implications for future suicide research and prevention for persons at risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 20:19:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1QWEdQRm5NVWRDSms2TVlSNjIyYTUyYVlEbWpMM2s2aVdQZ3lhbVFzY3B6T1M5cnlvUmdhWjA1Rm96MGhvLVZGY09MWUNGeXdBLVpGeVRoME93SUhRcG9CdDIyRDNwdElseXUzbVJxc1lNOVk</guid></item><item><title>今天最大的科学新闻：人类死于H5N5禽流感|火星上的“外星人”岩石| “其他”彗星阿特拉斯解体- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/news/live/latest-science-news-week-beginning-nov-24-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class=" article-body "&gt;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been directed to phase out all its research with monkeys, sources told Science's online news editor David Grimm. The directive came from a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee who's recently become the CDC's deputy chief of staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, federal agencies including the CDC and Food and Drug Administration have moved to reduce their reliance on animal research, pointing to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/is-fda-new-animal-testing-policy-safe" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/is-fda-new-animal-testing-policy-safe"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new technologies such as organ chips, organoids and sophisticated AI models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as alternate ways to collect data on disease states, drug mechanisms and toxicology. That said, these technologies are not yet advanced enough to replace all animal research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the CDC, monkeys are currently used to study infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS; in fact, CDC monkey research was integral to the recent invention of long-term preventive medications for HIV, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/harvard-chan-alum-who-resigned-from-cdc-leadership-shares-grave-concerns-about-the-state-of-public-health/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Demetre Daskalakis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, former director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2025/11/trust-public-health-reporting-and-the-cdc-insider-perspectives/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told reporters on a call last week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These new drugs are seen as potential game-changers in the effort to end the HIV epidemic worldwide, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/we-could-end-the-aids-epidemic-in-less-than-a-decade-heres-how" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/we-could-end-the-aids-epidemic-in-less-than-a-decade-heres-how"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sources previously told Live Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of the laboratory monkeys affected by this phase-out is still unclear, as are the motivations behind the directive itself. The Make America Healthy Again platform spearheaded by RFK Jr. has emphasized phasing out animal research, so that's one factor. But in addition, the administration has taken aim at funding for HIV research on several occasions, and more broadly, has deemphasized research into viruses and the treatment and prevention of infectious disease. So as I see it, the rationale for the cuts is likely multifactorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the monkey research phase-out at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/exclusive-cdc-end-all-monkey-research" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more about the CDC's decline &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/i-dont-know-if-cdc-will-survive-to-be-quite-frank-former-cdc-officials-describe-the-disintegration-of-the-agency-under-rfk" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/i-dont-know-if-cdc-will-survive-to-be-quite-frank-former-cdc-officials-describe-the-disintegration-of-the-agency-under-rfk"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here on Live Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="859720f6-ffcf-4413-814c-a6abea3a6b97"&gt;East Antarctica's ice sheets, which scientists once thought were holding steady in the face of human-caused climate change, are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/19/5231/2025/" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;melting during warm snaps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern Hemisphere's summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a spot of good news here. As ice sheets melt and mountaintops are exposed, iron-rich minerals will be carried into the surrounding ocean, a study published today (Nov. 24) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65714-y" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that exposed bedrock in Antarctica acts like an iron factory," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/w/kate-winter/" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Kate Winter&lt;/a&gt;, a geography professor at Northumbria University, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1107052" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spike in iron-rich minerals in the ocean could help soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the study authors suggest — though it could take thousands of years for that to happen, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="35f564df-29ec-44a2-8be8-90d0f7ba26f6"&gt;A discovery from a cave in southern Belgium has unearthed a horrifying prehistoric secret — a group of six Neanderthals, all of them women and children, were eaten by a group of unidentified cannibals roughly 45,000 years ago, Live Science’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/author/kristina-killgrove" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/author/kristina-killgrove"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kristina Killgrove&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact reasons for the grisly event, or whether the perpetrators were an outside group of Neanderthals or early &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/homo-sapiens.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/homo-sapiens.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all remain unclear.

Hot off the press is the news that the Ngogo chimps in Uganda saw a huge baby boom after they successfully invaded the territory of a neighboring community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t want to give our closest living relatives a bad rep — &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/jane-goodall-revolutionized-animal-research-but-her-work-had-some-unintended-consequences-heres-what-weve-learned-from-them" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/jane-goodall-revolutionized-animal-research-but-her-work-had-some-unintended-consequences-heres-what-weve-learned-from-them"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chimpanzees and bonobos are typically very cooperative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with members of their own group. But chimps in particular really don't gel with out-group individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anthro.ucla.edu/person/brian-wood/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brian Wood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; told Live Science contributor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/author/chris-simms" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/author/chris-simms"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chris Simms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this new discovery sheds light on the evolution of violence in humans. It's very common for biological anthropologists to use chimpanzee behavior as a window into our own evolutionary past: humans &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/do-humans-and-chimps-really-share-nearly-99-percent-of-their-dna" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/do-humans-and-chimps-really-share-nearly-99-percent-of-their-dna"&gt;&lt;u&gt;share a lot of DNA with chimps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and our human ancestors probably looked and behaved quite like modern-day chimpanzees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth bearing in mind, though, that the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/47885-chimpanzee-aggression-evolution.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/47885-chimpanzee-aggression-evolution.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;amount of chimp lethal aggression varies a lot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across Africa, largely dictated by the community’s social structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13727" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;East African chimps are known to be more aggressive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than those in West Africa and the Ngogo community is the largest chimpanzee community in the world. Personally, I'd love to see if this post-conflict spike in fertility is found across sites. Then we can see if this is a species-wide trend (which would lend more support to the idea of a shared evolutionary benefit) or if this is unique to Ngogo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/a-decade-long-chimp-war-ended-in-a-baby-boom-for-the-victors-scientists-discover" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/a-decade-long-chimp-war-ended-in-a-baby-boom-for-the-victors-scientists-discover"&gt;&lt;u&gt;read the full story here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="c5316ca8-b9da-4105-ae2e-18065ff9c7a2"&gt;On this day in 1974, two anthropologists digging in the earth of Hadar, Ethiopia discovered something that would transform the story of human evolution, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/author/tia-ghose" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/author/tia-ghose"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tia &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The object they spotted, glinting in a gully, was the fossilized remains of a 3.2 million-year-old human ancestor. As they discussed the find, the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" played in the background, leading a member of the dig to suggest they name the find "Lucy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy, whose species would become known as &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, was the oldest and most complete skeleton of a human ancestor ever found. And her discovery sparked the realization among anthropologists that human evolutionary history is more like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/a-braided-stream-not-a-family-tree-how-new-evidence-upends-our-understanding-of-how-humans-evolved" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/a-braided-stream-not-a-family-tree-how-new-evidence-upends-our-understanding-of-how-humans-evolved"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a braided stream than a family tree&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/science-history-iconic-lucy-fossil-discovered-transforming-our-understanding-of-human-evolution-nov-24-1974" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/science-history-iconic-lucy-fossil-discovered-transforming-our-understanding-of-human-evolution-nov-24-1974"&gt;&lt;u&gt;full story here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers from Mass General Brigham conducted a new study examining whether five widely followed diets could help prevent chronic constipation in middle- and older-age adults. The team monitored more than 96,000 participants for several years to see how long-term eating habits influenced the likelihood of developing this persistent gastrointestinal issue. Their analysis showed that people who routinely ate a Mediterranean or plant-based diet experienced a lower incidence of constipation. The findings appear in Gastroenterology.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chronic constipation affects millions of people and can significantly impact a patient's quality of life," said senior author Kyle Staller, MD, MPH, of the Division of Gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. "Our findings suggest that as we age, certain healthy diets may provide benefits to our gut beyond the known cardiovascular benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy Eating Patterns and Risk Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has demonstrated that healthy diets can ease constipation symptoms, but this study is the first to show that some diets may actually prevent chronic constipation from developing. "We have always assumed that the benefits of eating a healthy diet would be driven by fiber, but our analyses showed the benefit of these healthy diets on constipation were independent of fiber intake," said Staller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using information from the Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, the investigators evaluated long-term dietary patterns in middle- and older-age adults and identified who later experienced chronic constipation, which was defined as symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks within a year. The study assessed five diets: the Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet, low-carb diet, Western diet and inflammatory diet. Participants who consistently consumed a Western or inflammatory diet were more likely to develop chronic constipation, while those who followed a low-carb diet did not show a strong effect on constipation risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Dietary Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest a diet rich in vegetables, nuts and healthy fats may help prevent chronic constipation in middle- and older-age adults," said Staller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why it may interfere: &lt;/strong&gt;You need magnesium to activate vitamin D, but excess levels of magnesium can disrupt the balance of calcium in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gentile also recommends considering a food-first approach with magnesium. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/best-foods-with-magnesium-11736542" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Natural food sources of magnesium&lt;/a&gt; include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and beans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why it may interfere: &lt;/strong&gt;Some studies show that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements together may be good for bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/mind-body/calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplements" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium and vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; are safe to take together, very high doses of calcium may compete with the metabolism of vitamin D and other nutrients.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What to do instead: &lt;/strong&gt;If you need to take higher doses of calcium, spacing out when you take your vitamin D and calcium supplements throughout the day can help counteract any potential effects on vitamin D metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why it may interfere: &lt;/strong&gt;Research shows that an imbalance between supplementary &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-d-and-k-8427006" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D and vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; may lead to excess deposits of calcium into vascular tissue instead of bone. Over time, this could cause conditions such as atherosclerosis (the gradual thickening or hardening of the arteries), which could lead to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/heart-attack-causes-8691194" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What to do instead: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies show that taking the right concentrations of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-d-and-vitamin-k2-8739669" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin K2 and vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is beneficial, especially when it comes to cardiovascular and bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Speak to a healthcare provider before adding these to your daily routine, since the optimal dosage for each will depend on your health goals and needs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why it may interfere: &lt;/strong&gt;Excessive amounts of supplementary vitamin A may counteract the benefits of supplementary vitamin D on bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Since both vitamin A and vitamin D are fat-soluble vitamins, they share absorption pathways and compete for the same receptors affecting calcium metabolism," said Gentile.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What to do instead: &lt;/strong&gt;"Balance is more important than avoidance," said Gentile. "Both vitamin A and D are absorbed better with a fat-containing meal."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gentile also recommends consuming &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/foods-high-in-vitamin-a-8347800" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin A naturally from foods&lt;/a&gt; such as carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, and kale, as these sources provide &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/beta-carotene-8660538" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;beta-carotene&lt;/a&gt;, which converts to vitamin A only as needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "If your multivitamin contains vitamin A, look for a supplement with vitamin A mostly in the form of beta-carotene (not retinyl palmitate or retinyl acetate)," added Gentile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-taking-vitamin-d-supplements-safe-overall"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is safe to take with many other supplements; however, there are some important considerations with specific supplements, such as magnesium, calcium, vitamin K, and vitamin A.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before adding a new supplement or making any changes to your existing supplement routine, speak to a healthcare provider–such as a registered dietitian or doctor–to determine what's best for you. By using the proper dosages and timing of these supplements, you can prevent potential interferences and ensure optimal absorption, effectiveness, and nutrient metabolism.&lt;br&gt;

In Humboldt County, 17 percent of residents smoke, compared to the state average of 10 percent, putting them at higher risk. Fewer than one-third of people diagnosed with lung cancer survive beyond five years, but early detection through screening can save lives and give patients more options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ion robot performs minimally invasive, precise biopsies of lung nodules, enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment. Providence St. Joseph Hospital Eureka pulmonologist Dr. Robert Young, board-certified in pulmonary critical care, leads the use of the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform, which is improving patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Ion robot represents a major advancement in lung cancer diagnostics in our area,” said Dr. Young. “The precision allows us to safely reach and biopsy small nodules deep within the lung that were previously difficult to access. This means we can diagnose cancer earlier, reduce complications and provide patients with answers faster, which is critical in guiding treatment decisions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also provides annual low-dose CT scans for eligible adults. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for adults who are 50 to 80 years of age and have a 20 pack-year smoking history, including current smokers and those who quit within the past 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiologists review all scan results and assign a Lung-RADS score. Suspicious findings are evaluated by a team of specialists in radiology, pulmonology, oncology and surgery. The screening coordinator tracks results and ensures patients receive timely follow-up and support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early detection is the most powerful tool we have in the fight against lung cancer,” said Priscilla Lynn, director of cancer and infusion services, Providence St. Joseph Hospital Eureka. “The Ion robot’s advanced technology and local access to low-dose CT screening gives our patients the best chance at timely diagnosis, effective treatment and improved outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining innovation with compassionate care, Providence continues to lead efforts to improve outcomes and raise awareness about lung cancer prevention and screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who meet screening criteria are encouraged to talk with their provider or call 707719-0550, option 2 to schedule an exam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about our Cancer Program here: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/locations/norcal/st-joseph-hospital-eureka/cancer-program"&gt;Cancer Program | St. Joseph Hospital Eureka | Providence &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

H3N2 flus tend to cause more hospitalizations and deaths in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1ff74" class="body-graf"&gt;An early uptick in cases, Wolfe said, can create unique risks for this age group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6eb8f5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re seeing a really early flu season, you run the risk that some nursing homes may not have finished their vaccine deployments. Maybe a hospital hasn’t fully vaccinated its staff,” Wolfe said. “The community in general may not be as protected as it might have been if a virus turns up in January, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d757be" class="body-graf"&gt;While flu activity is considered low overall, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-46.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC’s latest flu report&lt;/a&gt; shows cases are on the rise. The agency estimates that at least 650,000 people have had the flu so far this season. Around 7,400 people have been hospitalized and 300 have died, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1dd4e" class="body-graf"&gt;The uptick in cases and emergency room visits are occurring mostly in children, Budd said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c84d13" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/week-37.html" target="_blank"&gt;280 children in the U.S. died from the flu&lt;/a&gt;. It was the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-vaccines-children-complication-cdc-deaths-rcna233436" target="_blank"&gt;deadliest flu season ever recorded for children&lt;/a&gt;, aside from the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc5473" class="body-graf"&gt;No pediatric deaths have been reported so far this season. Still, the early rise in flu activity is unsettling for doctors who spent last winter watching the virus sweep through schools, day cares and, consequently, hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-68a62e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It feels like the calm before the storm,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. “We may have a difficult influenza year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-944802" class="body-graf"&gt;The H3N2 strain is known for its ability to mutate easily.

Still, she encouraged people to get the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-379561" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of flu circulating so far this year is an A strain, called H3N2, according to the CDC.

The researchers found that DMT pushes the brain away from its usual “critical” balance between chaos and order, a state believed to be essential for coherent self-awareness over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift appears as a pronounced dampening of alpha waves, corresponding to stronger subjective experiences of ego dissolution. The findings suggest psychedelics may be uniquely suited to probing the neural foundations of consciousness and selfhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha-Wave Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; DMT significantly suppresses alpha activity, correlating with reports of ego dissolution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticality Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; The drug moves the brain away from its normal balance between chaos and order, weakening the continuity of self-related thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool for Consciousness Research:&lt;/strong&gt; The study supports using psychedelics to examine how the brain constructs self-awareness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people use a psychedelic called dimethyltryptamine (DMT), they experience a temporary loss of their sense of self. DMT interacts with a frequency of brain activity associated with self-referential processes (alpha waves), but it’s unclear how this activity relates to self-awareness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Timmerman, at University College London, and Marco Aqil, currently at the University of Miami, are among researchers who used DMT as a tool to explore the relationship between alpha waves and self-awareness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported in their &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience &lt;/em&gt;paper, the researchers discovered that DMT interacts with alpha waves in a way that is associated with stronger ratings of loss of the sense of self, sometimes termed ego death. These activity changes were related to what is termed “criticality.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaborates Timmerman, “The way the brain operates between chaos and order allows for normal brain function. Criticality refers to a brain state balanced between chaos and order that helps us predict things about the environment, the way we change or adapt to it, and our self-awareness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found that this shift away from criticality was a dampening or quieting of alpha waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing what this might mean, says Aqil, “We rely on past narratives and future predictions to have a coherent sense of self. In a DMT experience, people do not have a stream of consciousness over a period of time—everything takes place in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shift in criticality signatures in the alpha frequency [during a DMT experience likely reveals how] the time-extended component of the sense of self is weakened.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Timmerman and Aqil emphasize their work supports the idea that psychedelics may be a powerful tool for unraveling the neurological basis of human consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;COI Statement&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One author is a shareholder of Aspect Neuroprofiles BV, which develops physiology-informed prognostic measures for neurodevelopmental disorders.

Brain oscillations express signatures of near-critical dynamics, relevant for healthy function. Alterations in the proximity to criticality have been suggested to underlie the experiential and neurological effects of psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigate the effects of a psychedelic substance (DMT) on the criticality of brain oscillations, and in relation to subjective experience, in humans of either sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that DMT shifts the dynamics of brain oscillations away from criticality in alpha and adjacent frequency bands. In this context, entropy is increased while complexity is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that the criticality shifts observed in alpha and theta bands correlate with the intensity ratings of self-dissolution, a hallmark of psychedelic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, using a recently developed metric, the functional excitatory-inhibitory ratio, we find that the DMT-induced criticality shift in brain oscillations is towards subcritical regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have major implications for the understanding of psychedelic mechanisms of action in the human brain and for the neurological basis of altered states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:32:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5FWmdQckxHVTA1Z3lpb0ZMZ0Qwc3ozRXZQZWNoV2NUdW9pdFhrNkpzalRBQUltdzF0bFdoaE9JYzJ5LWNSMkVpeWJoMjZKZHZQTjh4Wk5iemQxcU5FTklLUVVIYUhjY3hLMFlScEVWT2JEOE9hV09uNzNR</guid></item><item><title>克罗恩病，糖尿病，与超加工食品有关的10个健康问题-今日医学新闻</title><link>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-no-fewer-than-12-chronic-health-conditions</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-7j3c6j"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cake-mix-factory-line-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cake-mix-factory-line-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cake-mix-factory-line-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="eager" src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cake-mix-factory-line-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="cake mix boxes on the factory line" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fultra-processed-foods-linked-to-no-fewer-than-12-chronic-health-conditions&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fcake-mix-factory-line-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Crohn's%2C%20diabetes%2C%2010%20more%20health%20issues%20tied%20to%20ultra-processed%20foods" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/cake-mix-factory-line-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1nzy6lj css-whkgel"&gt;Ultra-processed foods are linked to 12 health risks, including Crohn’s disease and diabetes, evidence shows.

UPFs are Group 4 of the NOVA system, and are defined as “formulations of ingredients, mostly of exclusive industrial use, typically created by (a) series of industrial techniques and processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common examples of UPFs include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;canned soups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;commercially baked goods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;frozen meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;prepackaged meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;processed meats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sodas and energy drinks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;snacks, such as potato chips, cookies, and crackers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sweetened breakfast cereals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the analysis of various studies, researchers determined that UPFs have been increasing in diets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For instance, the researchers found that in the United States and the United Kingdom, the estimated energy contribution of UPFs to the total food purchases or intake of a household stayed above 50%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This percentage tripled in Spain and China over the past 3 years, and in the last four 4 increased from 10% to 23% in both Mexico and Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals,” &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos-Monteiro-11/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Carlos A. Monteiro&lt;/a&gt;, MD, professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and first author of this study, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1105884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This change in what people eat is fueled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritizing ultra-processed products, supported by extensive marketing and political lobbying to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating,” Monteiro pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali, who was not involved in the study said he thought this was a very informative paper that further delineates the adverse outcomes of a diet high in UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a rise in consumption of ultra-processed foods worldwide, but particularly in the U.S., so medical practitioners in virtually all specialties will see the effects of this change in diet on patients. By doing research that shows how and why these foods are detrimental, patients — and medical professionals — can better understand why these foods should be minimized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Mir Ali, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed to better define the mechanism by which ultra-processed hurt the body,” Ali added. “Also, a comparison of different diet types vs UPFs to show the difference in health effects would also be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, who offered her top tips on how to reduce UPFs in our diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First, I encourage people to start with assessing access, ability, and awareness — not focusing on guilt or shame,” Richard told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My job as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) is to meet people where they are, not where an idealized version of themselves or society thinks they ‘should’ be. We are able to translate evidence into daily, doable habits that can change the trajectory of health and enhance quality of life. Changes can be complex when considering the current landscape, pertinent health disparities, and lack of health literacy in specific populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, when an individual is willing and able to navigate changes, it can also be quite simple to make small, but impactful changes,” she added. “I have educated clients on healthier choices available anywhere they are — from dollar stores to gas stations, fast food chains to airports, hospitals to truck stops and more.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard’s first tip is to add before you subtract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Instead of focusing on what to remove, add foods beneficial to health where possible and accessible,” she advised. “Over time, nutrient-dense foods naturally crowd out UPFs. Try adding a serving of fruit in its natural ‘packaging’ (skin) to a meal or a day, [or] a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323042" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, beans, or a vegetable at each meal.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Richard suggested making swaps without sacrificing convenience. If the top ingredients are sugar, starches, oils, emulsifiers, gums, or stabilizers, she detailed, the food is likely ultra-processed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard said to look for other available choices. For instance, she said, we can “swap sugary beverages for water infused with citrus, berries, or herbs, or a non-sugar flavor infusers like crystallized (powdered, dehydrated form of citrus) lemon, lime, or orange.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tip was to “choose minimally processed proteins (rotisserie chicken, beans, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295714" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/278340" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt;), baked, grilled, or broiled instead of breaded or fried entrees, or opt for lower-sodium canned tuna, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/are-sardines-good-for-you" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sardines&lt;/a&gt;, or chicken.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, “replace a snack of chips or crackers with a trail mix made of nuts and dried fruit,“ Richard advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also urged everyone to cook a little more at home. It does not have to be perfect or elaborate, she said, just more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even one home-prepared meal makes a difference,” Richard continued. “Research has shown numerous long-term benefits of families cooking and sharing meals together that extend far beyond nutrient intake at that moment.

Chu Family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers at the University of Manchester in the UK have spent more than 15 years &lt;span&gt;develo&lt;/span&gt;ping a gene therapy for Hunter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, a team at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital has seemingly stalled the disease by altering Oliver’s cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oliver is the first of five boys in the world to receive the experimental intervention, and a year after beginning treatment, he appears to be developing normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Every time we talk about it, I want to cry because it’s just so amazing,” his mother, Jingru Chu, told the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0y56x6veo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Almost always exclusive to boys, Hunter syndrome affects 1 in 100,000 male births worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients seem healthy at birth, but they begin to show symptoms around the age of 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A genetic error prevents cells from producing the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), which is essential for breaking down large sugar molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver’s treatment began last December when his care team harvested stem cells from his blood. BBC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the most severe cases, children start to experience problems with basic functioning between 6 and 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients with the severe form of the disease typically die in their late teens or early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oliver’s treatment began last December when the team harvested stem cells from his blood. Scientists then inserted the missing IDS gene into a hollow virus shell designed to deliver it into the stem cells’ nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We use the machinery from the virus to insert a working copy of the faulty gene into each of the stem cells,” Dr. Karen Buckland, lead scientist for Great Ormond Street Hospital’s Cell and Gene Therapy Service, explained to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When those go back to Oliver, they should repopulate his bone marrow and start to produce new white blood cells, and each of these will hopefully start to produce the missing protein [enzyme] in his body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As planned, these genetically engineered stem cells were delivered via infusion in February to repopulate Oliver’s bone marrow. The team was hopeful that the stem cells would begin producing white blood cells, which would then make the missing enzyme and deliver it throughout his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up tests revealed that the gene therapy was working, and Oliver is producing the missing enzyme. BBC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Follow-up tests in May revealed that the gene therapy was working, and Oliver was indeed producing the key enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He’s doing really well. We have seen him progressing in his speech and mobility. In just three months, he has matured,” his father, Ricky, told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ricky and Jingru reported that Oliver is “so different” from before his treatment — now he is more verbal and engaged with other children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’ve been waiting 20 years to see a boy like Ollie doing as well as he is, and it’s just so exciting,” said Simon Jones, who is co-leading the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Before the transplant, Ollie didn’t make any enzyme at all, and now he’s making hundreds of times the normal amount. But more importantly, we can see he’s improving, he’s learning, he’s got new words and new skills, and he’s moving around much more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Until now, the only medical treatment available for Hunter syndrome was Elaprase. The drug, which &lt;a href="https://www.drugpatentwatch.com/p/biologics/tradename/ELAPRASE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:costs around $600,000;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;costs around $600,000&lt;/a&gt; per patient per year, can slow the physical effects of the disease, but because it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, it cannot stave off cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oliver was initially deemed too old for the trial, as the treatment cannot reverse existing damage. However, tests revealed that his development was largely unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He, along with the four other boys who received the treatment, will be monitored for two years. The research team is hopeful that, if the trial is deemed successful, they can partner with a biotech firm to license the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We need to be careful and not get carried away in the excitement of all this, but things are as good as they could be at this point in time,” said Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:03:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPQXJKdnR3Z09pYkR3ckMzOGIyNWIyd09UaE91TXFldktWN3o5dkstYlJwcHcyYmp4YUhRNzRjSHZmb3ZycnNGQldtU2xKX3lmZUNQb2pWVlBVSzZSN01DRUNQUUYwZlgtcVZ1YWtPMlhSd1d4TXhPcVh1eV9RT05nZVA2bENSNlptc1E</guid></item><item><title>为什么老年人的自杀率如此之高--以及我们能做些什么--《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/why-suicide-rates-are-so-high-among-older-adults-in-washington/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPRzVEWk9OU21nS0xKdXJMTkxXVmVEdGJGR1ZGTjFDcnFyUWRpMmhSSlNIQmNicHFWeXZ6UHpVdWY2ZTNLQTJCNzVVbHpRbDdjUlBSUWVoMnlkYS1tYzFUNTlualhpU0tUbzNrWVdRWFhnbGZzTW5rZkQ4clhSSEZDTDhwbjNTb0UtbzktMFFNZUpKZE84czRhRWc0OXZPU0VRc1p2Mk9rNG9tdnQ5eFR2UkpyZFd2T3A2eWRr?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Why suicide rates are so high among older adults — and what we can do about it&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPRzVEWk9OU21nS0xKdXJMTkxXVmVEdGJGR1ZGTjFDcnFyUWRpMmhSSlNIQmNicHFWeXZ6UHpVdWY2ZTNLQTJCNzVVbHpRbDdjUlBSUWVoMnlkYS1tYzFUNTlualhpU0tUbzNrWVdRWFhnbGZzTW5rZkQ4clhSSEZDTDhwbjNTb0UtbzktMFFNZUpKZE84czRhRWc0OXZPU0VRc1p2Mk9rNG9tdnQ5eFR2UkpyZFd2T3A2eWRr</guid></item><item><title>为什么感恩节后散步是值得的- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/11/24/walk-after-meal-thanksgiving-minutes-why</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:54:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5WVGFCNmFYRFRNZVZ4UHNTOWRzbzBIRThaRDM5T1ZaVFhVNjNnY3Y4UzhTRERGekp3a2NTS2pVTllQTWxJWGo5TG0xTmtuT0tEOWRGRFhURDAwai05eDhpTl81ZnFWZkRVSkVfYTY3eTdwNE02MEdDblJyekl6Zw</guid></item><item><title>GLP-1s与妊娠之间的复杂关系-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/24/glp-1s-pregnancy/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRTCK2HRFFDYVPY74LX4FNJHVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who stopped taking weight-loss drugs before or during pregnancy were associated with greater gestational weight gain and had a higher risk of preterm delivery and gestational diabetes compared with those who had not been prescribed the drugs before, according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2840578" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:31:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1JM3JDQjM5bUVqOU5KdlFFRVVSdUVmUlVjZUg5d01Zb2R0US00c1IwWmNjdVA5S05jVTVLNFhMel9IWVVYR3dUb2lqSGFOcTJJWGR5RWJFUm44SGVuMmg3OVRoXzBxR3NfakR4TDFYMmJtaWl4</guid></item><item><title>分析显示，美国每两个人中就有一人患有神经系统疾病或紊乱- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-people-affected-neurological-disease-disorder.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

Thompson said that her daughter’s kidneys are still not functioning properly, but her creatinine levels are dropping, so doctors said it was safe to send her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not over,” Thompson said. “It’s going to take a minute for her body to actually get back to normal. It’s still an ongoing thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson credits support and prayers from family to get through the harrowing ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She cried. She had to be sedated. She had to be held down for her IVs. She had to be held down for her feeding tube,” Thompson said of her daughter’s stay in the hospital. “It was very distressing on her. She’s getting tortured basically. I know they’re helping her, but in her mind that’s what it felt like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary McGonigle-Martin, vice president of Parker’s Promise, said the organization reached out to the family of another patient, a 16-year-old, who also fell ill not long after visiting the Arizona State Fair on Oct. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGonigle-Martin said that James is part of an outbreak that has affected nearly 200 people that Parker’s Promise has heard about so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were at the state fair,” McGonigle-Martin said, referring to the family of Aaliyah James. “So something is happening at the state fair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGonigle-Martin had her own experience with hemolytic uremic syndrome when her young son was afflicted with the toxin in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My son spent 56 days in the hospital, he was on a ventilator for nine days, he had acute pancreatitis, along with his kidneys, he had seizures,” McGonigle-Martin said. “It’s hard to believe by going and petting animals at a petting zoo, that could happen, and it does – every single year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arizona State Fair, which ran from Sept. 19 to Oct. 26 at the fairgrounds in Phoenix, sent a contact to Cronkite News on Tuesday, but failed to respond to multiple inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who is this affecting?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after she was admitted to the ICU, one of the doctors at the Phoenix Children’s Hospital Arrowhead Campus in Glendale asked Thompson if she and her daughter had attended the Arizona State Fair. When Thompson confirmed that they had, the doctor told her she would receive a call from Maricopa County health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James was not the first case they had seen, Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the ICU doctors actually told me a bunch of kiddos contracted the same exact strand as her,” Thompson said. “And they all went to the fair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late October, multiple teenagers and children began appearing at emergency rooms around the state with severe symptoms that included bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps and vomiting. Doctors determined the children had been getting sick from a toxin called Shiga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shiga toxin originates from certain strains of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; affected by the Shigella dysenteriae bacteriophage, a virus that infects and alters the genome of bacteria to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an affected strain, known as a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, also known as STEC, dies off, the Shiga toxin is released into the host’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556038/#:~:text=Shiga%20toxin%E2%80%93producing,4%5D%5B5%5D"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt;, Shiga toxin is responsible for 90% to 95% of hemolytic uremic syndrome cases, as seen in James.. Hemolytic uremic syndrome damages blood vessels in the kidneys, destroying red blood cells and threatening the kidneys and other organs, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352399"&gt;Mayo Clinic’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Maricopa County Department of Public Health, along with the Arizona Department of Health Services, is investigating a statewide increase in &lt;i&gt;E. &lt;/i&gt;coli cases relative to historical trends during the month of October,” according to Courtney Kreuzwiesner, the preparedness communications supervisor at the Public Health office of Maricopa County, in a statement to Cronkite News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 13, the Arizona Department of Health Services alerted health care providers across the state to be wary. Kreuzwiesner said an investigation into&lt;i&gt; E. coli &lt;/i&gt;is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ADHS issued a Healthcare Advisory related to a two-fold increase of&lt;i&gt; E. coli&lt;/i&gt;,” said Juan Pablo Martin, ADHS media director, in a statement to Cronkite News. “There has also been an increase in hospitalizations involving (HUS).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two cases from Oct. 26&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Parker’s Promise, the pair aren’t alone; the nonprofit has received reports of 186 cases as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an outbreak of STEC from the AZ State Fair and many children are hospitalized – we have heard of at least 186 cases,” &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/666014198733413/permalink/1208809774453850/?rdid=cKHgo5xY7hLrgZQP&amp;amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2F1BaKYZDh2a%2F#"&gt;according to a Facebook post &lt;/a&gt;by Parker’s Promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Facebook post features two of 186 cases the organization said originated from the state fair. James first went to the emergency room on Halloween, and she was sent home. She returned to the ER the next day. On Nov. 2, she was transported to Phoenix Children’s Hospital. She had her third blood transfusion on Nov. 14 and a sixth round of dialysis on Nov. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Facebook post said the 16-year-old was hospitalized for four days at Phoenix Children’s hospital in November. She had a much shorter stint in the hospital than James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Health officials are investigating a ‘historical trend’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correlation between the Arizona State Fair and an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; outbreak is under investigation; however, as of Wednesday, the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department hasn’t received confirmation that the two instances are linked to each other or the state fair, according to MaFernanda Pacheco, a communications officer for the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is found in people’s colons, the Shiga toxin is primarily native to cows, sheep and pigs, and contact with them can lead to harm, according to Dr. Jonathan Blum, an infectious disease doctor in Santa Clara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amount of bacteria that are needed to cause an infection in a human with this particular strain is exceptionally small,” Blum said Thursday. “Even a really microscopic amount of bacteria can cause an infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blum advises people who visit petting zoos to properly sanitize by washing their hands and avoid touching their faces or mouths, and be especially careful of small children or those who don’t have the capacity to “manage hand hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Contact with animals does not require actually touching the animal. Contact with contaminated surfaces can also spread this infection,” Blum said. “Because the infectious dose is so small, very small amounts of fecal contamination on surfaces can lead to infection. When you were a kid, your parents probably told you to wash your hands before dinner. They were right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arizona State Fair advertised the access children have when they attend the petting zoo, according to the fair’s website. “Get up close and personal with furry and fuzzy friends. Snap a selfie with a sheep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phoenix Children’s Hospital media relations specialist Grace Culqui said they cannot confirm any cases of STEC at their hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the interest of patient privacy, we’re not able to release specific patient census data,” Culqui said in an email. “I believe your questions are better suited for the county health department.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2841763?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamaneurol.2025.4691" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;published Monday in JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers linked obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that causes temporary pauses in breathing during sleep, with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that causes tremors, stiffness, and difficulty speaking, moving and swallowing. It is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States, after Alzheimer’s disease, with 90,000 people diagnosed each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, said Dr. Lee Neilson, a neurologist at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who led the study. But the researchers did find that treating sleep apnea with a continuous positive airway pressure (or CPAP) machine was associated with a reduced likelihood of developing Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So identifying those at highest risk for the neurological condition — and intervening early, Neilson said, “might make the biggest impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What the study found &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed medical records from more than 11 million U.S. veterans treated through the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1999 and 2022. The group was predominantly male with an average age of 60, representing those at highest risk for sleep apnea, experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that about 14% of the participants had been diagnosed with sleep apnea between 1999 and 2022, according to their medical records. When the researchers looked at their health six years after those diagnoses, they found that the veterans with sleep apnea were nearly twice as likely to have developed Parkinson’s disease compared with those who had not been diagnosed with sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This held even after controlling for other factors that could influence the development of sleep apnea or Parkinson’s disease, including high body mass index and conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, traumatic brain injuries and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who started using CPAP machines within two years of their diagnoses were about 30% less likely to develop Parkinson’s disease than those who didn’t use the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPAP machines blow air through a face mask to keep the airway open. When used correctly and consistently, the devices are effective at treating sleep apnea. But many people find them noisy or uncomfortable and don’t stick with them long enough to reap their benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not prove that sleep apnea caused Parkinson’s disease, nor that using CPAP machines could stave off the disease, said Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy, a physician and sleep researcher at the University of Arizona who was not involved with the new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he said, the study was important — and to his knowledge, the largest and strongest to date suggesting the association between sleep apnea and Parkinson’s disease. He hopes it will encourage more research into the link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why sleep apnea might affect Parkinson’s risk &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 13% of Parkinson’s cases worldwide are linked to genetic mutations, and some research suggests that environmental toxins like pesticides and heavy metals might also increase the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how sleep apnea may play a role in the condition, said Dr. Ronald Postuma, a professor of neurology at McGill University in Montreal who was not involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors theorized that by limiting oxygen over time, sleep apnea could cause enough damage to brain cells that they no longer function properly, contributing to Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition might also interfere with the brain’s waste removal system, called the glymphatic system, which operates mainly during sleep, said Dr. Gregory Scott, an assistant professor of pathology at the OHSU School of Medicine and a co-author of the study. Some scientists have said that this might also explain the connection between sleep apnea and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take much more research to confirm any of these theories. Still, Parthasarathy added, it makes sense that a sleep condition that regularly limits oxygen to the brain could contribute to a neurological disease like Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a pie-in-the-sky kind of finding,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the study encourages more people to seek treatment for sleep apnea, that would be a good thing, the experts we spoke with agreed. CPAP machines “can be annoying and challenging to try,” Scott added, but their benefits can be invaluable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Is it true that &lt;a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/700childrens/2025/02/11-period-myths-and-facts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;you can’t swim&lt;/a&gt; on your period? No. Does the scent of a person menstruating &lt;a href="https://bear.org/bear-facts/how-do-black-bears-respond-to-menstrual-odors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;attract bears&lt;/a&gt;? Also no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is one period rumor I’ve always kind of enjoyed, though: when women are in close proximity for long enough, their menstrual cycles will eventually sync up, also known as “menstrual synchrony”. I’ve had several friends over the years claim that my period had yanked them on to my cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I remember hearing that from family members when I was younger,” says Dr Rachel Jensen, Darney-Landy fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Jensen says she understands why this belief is so popular: “The idea that our bodies would synchronize with those we are close to is comforting and connecting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the body doesn’t actually work that way. Below, what you need to know about this common myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-menstrual-synchrony-real" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is menstrual synchrony real?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The idea gained a lot of attention in the early 1970s, when Dr Martha McClintock published the first scientific paper on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10771221/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menstrual synchrony&lt;/a&gt;. In it, she observed students living in a college dorm, and determined that women who live in close proximity or share a common environment experience a convergence of their menstrual cycles. This became known as the McClintock Effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A number of subsequent studies in the 1990s confirmed McClintock’s finding. Some suggested that the shift may be the result of “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24222338/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;olfactory cues&lt;/a&gt;” or pheromones which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10771221/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accelerate or delay&lt;/a&gt; the menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But more recent studies that have been “more rigorously designed” have “generally failed to show any synchrony between menstrual cycles in women living together,” says Dr Jewel Kling, chair of women’s health at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And research has failed to show how the body would even trigger this effect. “There isn’t a biological mechanism for menstrual syncing,” says Jensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-do-so-many-people-believe-in-menstrual-synchrony" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do so many people believe in menstrual synchrony?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Many women think this is true,” says Dr Salena Zanotti, OB-GYN at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If it seems like people’s periods are syncing up, that’s the result of information biases and statistics rather than biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We are more likely to know and remember the menstrual timing of those we are close with, Jensen says. This means that if our cycles sync up, we are more likely to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since menstrual cycles vary in time and length, it’s statistically likely that the cycles of two people will eventually overlap, Jensen says: “Studies show that cycles sync up at the same rate as we would expect based on mathematical probability due to chance”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-affects-menstrual-cycle-timing" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What affects menstrual cycle timing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many factors affect the timing and duration of one’s menstrual cycle, experts say.

  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Body composition: a high BMI is associated with irregular cycles, says Kling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Age: “Menses can be irregular in adolescents and as people approach menopause,” says Jensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Psychological stress: depression can disrupt a person’s cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Medication, such as birth control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Medical conditions, such as thyroid disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome or menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption, diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-other-common-menstrual-myths" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are other common menstrual myths?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many menstrual myths are cultural, says Zanotti, like the idea that periods are dirty or embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She also points to the myth that using a tampon or a menstrual cup means that one is not a virgin. (Not true.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nor is it true that people should not have sex or exercise while on their period, says Jensen. “Both are safe, though people should be aware that there is still a risk of STIs or pregnancy while on their period,” she says, adding that exercise can help with certain period symptoms like cramps or mood changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Such menstrual myths seem to propagate freely, while some facts remain under-discussed. Kling says that menstrual-related conditions such as painful menses (dysmenorrhea), abnormal uterine bleeding, and physical and psychological premenstrual symptoms are very common. “Up to 85% of women experience some menstrual-related syndrome,” she says. “And 40% report being significantly bothered by them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way, says Zanotti. “Periods are a normal way of life,” she says. “They do not have to be very painful and very heavy.” If one struggles with their cycle, she suggests seeing a medical provider to help manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although the myth of menstrual synchrony is relatively harmless, Jensen notes that “there can be serious consequences if people follow inaccurate health advice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you see or hear something on social media or from a friend, it is always a good idea to check with your doctor before acting on it or even passing it on,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPVml2WnVSNGl6TlVTTGdiejg5Y2xleUx6M3c5Nkt2N2FLN1U4ZmdzVW1SX2l3RjhJUS1ZYS1Rc2hUY3pjSGNJN3pjWDY2azlBWmRmVDhNLTMwZ1A1cUNTTU1GS1Q5d09oYm9nTFQ2dVJCaTl2NjlsNVZ2UVRPRTI2b2E5aW9mUQ</guid></item><item><title>MAPK驱动的上皮细胞可塑性驱动结直肠癌治疗抵抗-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09916-w</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class="c-article-author-information__list"&gt;&lt;li class="c-article-author-information__item" id="na1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These authors contributed equally: Mark White, Megan L.

The trend is especially notable among Asian communities that have long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8176990/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;faced higher rates&lt;/a&gt; of the cancer, according to the National Institute for Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NWJU5LYGPFDELFZCZKUWJSFEIU"&gt;Nationally, stomach cancer accounts for 1.5% of new cancer diagnoses, with an estimated 30,300 new cases expected in 2025 according to the American Cancer Society. Researchers in New Jersey reported an average of 442 new late-stage cases per year from a 2017–2021 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Symptoms of stomach cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5AIFHRIKKZHXVPYAFFKSP3GCVA"&gt;“Most patients with early gastric cancer have no symptoms at all,” Liu said. “Vague complaints like indigestion or mild discomfort often get dismissed.

She said her bloodwork was also abnormal, and she was sent to an oncologist who gave her iron infusions. But her iron levels weren’t improving the way they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QYLVZ75B2RBE3OM6NFBFI4SGJ4"&gt;H. pylori is a major but overlooked contributor. Many carriers show no symptoms. Detection requires a stool test or endoscopic biopsy.

This means that there are a whole lot of people out there who are at &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470561"&gt;an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of having a heart attack, stroke, or getting heart disease, and they don’t even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that your cholesterol levels are something you can control. We asked cardiologists about how to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is LDL cholesterol?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/cholesterol-explained"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; is typically referenced generally and almost always negatively, but it’s actually a bit more nuanced. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/ethan-korngold.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/ethan-korngold.html"}' href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/ethan-korngold.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ethan Korngold, MD,&lt;/a&gt; an interventional cardiologist who works with the health company Abbott, explains that cholesterol, which is a waxy fat-like substance found in the body, is essential to build cells and produce vitamins and hormones. “However, too much cholesterol can cause problems because it narrows the arteries, blocking blood flow, which increases the risk of heart disease,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470561/"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; is transported through the blood by lipoproteins, including two types of lipoproteins: high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). HDL (often referred to as “good” cholesterol) transports cholesterol to the liver, where it’s then broken down and excreted. LDL transports cholesterol to cells, and as Dr. Korngold explained, too much of it can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries. That’s why LDL cholesterol is often referred to as “bad” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do you know if you have high LDL cholesterol?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re relatively young and generally in good health, preventing high LDL cholesterol is still important. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason"}' href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jason Hoff, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor at Loma Linda University Health, says that cholesterol plaque buildup is something that can happen over time without you even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you can feel.

While the results are encouraging, they need to be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181608" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ProgranulinDiagram.jpg" alt="Progranulin diagram" class="wp-image-181608 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ProgranulinDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ProgranulinDiagram-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181608" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The progranulin protein is important for normal brain health.

Sci.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2022)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progranulin plays a vital role in the health and functionality of neurons. Scientists have previously linked mutations &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2021.11.015"&gt;in the progranulin gene&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;GRN&lt;/em&gt;) – and a subsequent disruption in progranulin production – with FTD-causing damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That progranulin shortfall is what VES001 has been designed to target, and the researchers behind the trial believe it could help people with and without &lt;em&gt;GRN&lt;/em&gt; mutations. If levels of progranulin can be maintained, FTD &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-extra-fold-in-the-human-brain-may-delay-early-dementia-by-years"&gt;may, in theory, never develop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment focuses on the sortilin receptor, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1437886"&gt;known to clear&lt;/a&gt; progranulin from the brain. The primary function of VES001 is to limit the effectiveness of the sortilin receptor, slowing the removal of progranulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For several years, we have been studying the role of the sortilin receptor in neurodegeneration," &lt;a href="https://biomed.au.dk/display/artikel/danish-basic-research-behind-international-medical-breakthrough-new-oral-treatment-may-prevent-dementia"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nykjær.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seeing this knowledge translated into a treatment that now shows promising clinical results is a major step forward for the field – and a testament to the vital importance of basic research for the development of new therapies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those with a &lt;em&gt;GRN&lt;/em&gt; genetic mutation, the treatment was shown to return progranulin to near-normal levels in both blood plasma and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; that travels around the body's nervous system, delivering nutrients and removing waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers won't be drawn on a timeline for treatments becoming available to the public – additional clinical trials will be required before that happens – but it's a case of so far, so good for VES001. And the difference it could make is huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The increase of progranulin levels back to normal levels in these asymptomatic mutation carriers – who know they will develop symptoms in the next 10 to 20 years – speaks to the future potential of this treatment to prevent people ever developing symptoms of FTD," &lt;a href="https://451a9cb6-e007-4957-95a3-e59c856fd69f.filesusr.com/ugd/61ce8f_76edf011b0a540fb9ea2012aa75ac360.pdf"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Jonathan Rohrer, principal investigator of the trial at from the Queen Square Institute of Neurology at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06226064"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06705192"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the Vesper Bio press release is &lt;a href="https://451a9cb6-e007-4957-95a3-e59c856fd69f.filesusr.com/ugd/61ce8f_76edf011b0a540fb9ea2012aa75ac360.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But the ripple effects from the cluster first identified in Penobscot County in October 2023 are being felt across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers are confident that the outbreak will lead to new cases outside the Bangor area, and some local governments and community organizations are taking proactive steps to get ahead of that spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their efforts reflect an awareness that the outbreak will likely reach beyond Penobscot County and affect the entire state. They also come at a critical time when threats to public health infrastructure at the federal level could jeopardize efforts to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health providers in the southern Maine area kind of circled up and we’ve been having conversations around how to prepare for a similar outbreak,” said Katie Rutherford, the executive director of Portland’s Frannie Peabody Center. The organization is dedicated to providing support to people with HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple people involved with municipal and nonprofit public health organizations outside of Penobscot County told the Bangor Daily News that these preparations are a necessary step in the face of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would be more surprised if we didn’t see any cases,” said Bridget Rauscher, Portland’s public health director. “We don’t know for sure the extent of this outbreak, which I think is kind of important to remember. We only know what we’ve tested, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutherford and Rauscher’s organizations have both been ramping up HIV testing efforts in southern Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.portlandmaine.gov/1482/News?contentId=ffad011a-65b2-42e5-80db-ebf3b72cfc24" target="_blank"&gt;Portland’s health department announced &lt;/a&gt;it was adding a walk-in testing day to its STD clinic, citing the HIV outbreak in Penobscot County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maine’s largest city is also encouraging more frequent testing, offering more testing certification trainings, and partnering with homelessness and recovery organizations to administer tests in the community, according to Rauscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We generally will encourage people to test for HIV and hepatitis C every three to six months. We’ve moved that up to every one to three months,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Penobscot County outbreak is largely affecting people who are homeless or use drugs. Rauscher said her department is particularly focused on testing residents who share those risk factors or who said they’ve recently come to Portland from Bangor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV self-test kits have also been crucial for organizations with limited staff, and deploying staff out into the community has helped reach more people with testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re very user-friendly self-test kits and it’s just an oral swab. It’s nothing painful or really even uncomfortable in the way that the nasal swabs were with COVID,” Rutherford said. Her organization distributes more than 1,500 tests every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some smaller cities are starting efforts to ramp up testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Augusta are looking into ways the city could provide HIV self-test kits, according to Steve Leach, Augusta’s deputy fire chief and health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The city itself doesn’t have a big footprint involved in [HIV prevention] right now,” he said, but conversations with people in Penobscot County who are working to mitigate the outbreak prompted him to consider new solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency medical services teams already bring naloxone, the overdose reversal drug often known by the brand name Narcan, when responding to substance use calls, Leach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s looking into whether the city could also distribute HIV tests this way, which would require approval from the state, or if it would be possible to distribute them through other agencies in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the HIV prevention work in Augusta is done by MaineGeneral, the nonprofit health care system headquartered there. The health system works with harm reduction programs, Maine Family Planning and social service organizations to provide testing, safe sex supplies, clean syringes and connections to treatment, according to Shane Gallagher, MaineGeneral’s director of HIV and harm reduction services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the health system announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.mainegeneral.org/about-us/news/2025/hivaids-services-expand/" target="_blank"&gt;expanding &lt;/a&gt;its federally funded HIV/AIDS medical services to cover nearly all of Maine’s counties. It also operates a &lt;a href="https://www.mainegeneral.org/about-us/community-health/harm-reduction/" target="_blank"&gt;syringe service program&lt;/a&gt; in Augusta and Waterville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization has been working to increase testing and provide more home test kits, Gallagher reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the state, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is coordinating with organizations like MaineGeneral to replicate what’s being done in the Bangor area to other cities and towns, according to Anne Sites, Maine CDC’s director of infectious disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing we’ve seen in Penobscot County is a really successful initiative to enhance our reach around PrEP,” she said, referring to the medication that reduces the risk of contracting HIV. She noted ongoing conversations with Maine Family Planning about using mobile services to provide PrEP in the Lewiston-Auburn area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maine CDC is also encouraging clinical providers across the state to focus on the syndemic of HIV, STDs, hepatitis and substance use disorder — a concept that refers to the way co-occurring epidemics can exacerbate each other — and test simultaneously for HIV and other diseases, Sites said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the HIV cases identified as part of the Penobscot County outbreak appeared alongside cases of hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health organizations have also stressed that syringe services, a type of harm reduction that involves providing people who use drugs with clean needles, are a key part of HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syringe service programs are proven to reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission rates by around 50%, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-syringe-services/php/about/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Their organizers often provide other services, including testing for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, syringe service providers in Maine conducted 526 HIV tests onsite, according to a &lt;a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/doc/11834" target="_blank"&gt;report from the state’s Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/a&gt; That number is up from 373 in 2023 and 96 in 2022. The most recent report also detailed 4,498 referrals by Maine syringe service providers to outside organizations for testing and care for viral hepatitis, STDs and HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Portland’s syringe exchange has been operating for more than 25 years, syringe service programs face resistance in some of Maine’s smaller cities because of concerns about needle waste or&lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2024/11/syringe-services-for-people-who-inject-drugs-are-enormously-effective-but-remain-underused" target="_blank"&gt; misconceptions&lt;/a&gt; that they will encourage drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is often politicized. But it’s an effective public health strategy,” Rauscher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple municipalities in Maine are currently working to limit syringe exchange services. Auburn instituted a six-month moratorium on needle exchange programs in August, while Sanford is considering banning needle distribution altogether, according to an October report by City Manager Steven Buck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the city of Auburn did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewiston passed an ordinance last month limiting the city to just one syringe service provider. In response to a question about whether the city of Lewiston is monitoring the outbreak and preparing for it to spread, city spokesperson Angelynne Amores wrote, “Maine CDC measures that — it is not measured locally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any local efforts to combat HIV spread could be overshadowed by proposals at the federal level to eliminate funding for such services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House appropriations bill for next year proposed cutting $1.7 billion in funding for HIV programs, including completely eliminating HIV prevention programs and reducing care and treatment funding by 20 percent, &lt;a href="https://hivhep.org/press-releases/house-republicans-go-way-beyond-presidents-budget-by-ending-all-hiv-prevention-slash-aids-care-by-20/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed budget was “very bad timing for Maine,” Matt Wellington, the associate director of the Maine Public Health Association, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in Maine have also struggled to get support from the U.S. CDC amid the Penobscot County outbreak. In October, the federal agency paused a request to send field epidemiologists to help manage the outbreak, partly because of the government shutdown, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/07/metro/cdc-maine-bangor-opioid-needle-shutdown-kennedy-penobscot/" target="_blank"&gt;the Boston Globe reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a small state like Maine where it’s not normal for us to have HIV outbreaks of this size, we’re just not equipped to handle it by ourselves,” Wellington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and others in Maine’s public health sphere agreed that resources and funding are essential for supporting the people who have been diagnosed with HIV and for preventing new spikes in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People can live healthy lives with HIV,” Rutherford said, “but I think people also need to understand that if these robust programs were to go away and people don’t have access to their medications, then it might as well be 1981 again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WGME</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:21:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxOMjB0eDY2ZFdRRnlpUlhlOFpGWUVfT1AzMWIyYWcwY0hDdlVENGp6TWoxX3lLMXV0Mm5tYWloNG9idm9NOUFEOWRqUjZVSUwyMnU5dmMzNmlyd0EzaGZVUFFOR0p4YTVkN2c0N1haamx5R2xRalVyT0tURHV3ZDhfT3FvSHRCV2tEX0t3ei1zVmNmUzExMjN6dmE1MFo3c3FjQlJXVXB3UVZvYmtVUlVKNy1maFRZS19HbUZqcEd1ZTFCaWhpSnE2aTlHenN6MnpYa0lvV3ZfcTV2VTBsNzZjQ0xReEtnQzZ5UHJRdS1yU2ZRaVFvd0FMaXFrdWl0bEU2ckRld240X3lxVnMxaDY4</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，肌肉发达的人大脑衰老速度较慢-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/b735a78a-8a29-4aa2-a1da-20e42bb1cef9</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complete digital access to quality FT journalism with expert analysis from industry leaders.

As of now, the &lt;a href="https://equinediseasecc.org/news/article/Equine-Herpesvirus-Myeloencephalopathy-(EHM)-Outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Equine Disease Communication Center reports 11 confirmed cases in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, though experts warn that number is likely to rise. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://cypresstrailsranch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cypress Trails Ranch, LLC&lt;/a&gt;, near Humble, owner Darolyn Butler said concern is running high.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s evidently, incredibly contagious, and that’s the scary part,” Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the horses at Butler's ranch attended the Waco event, but state officials said EHV-1 spreads easily between horses through nose-to-nose contact, airborne particles from sneezing, shared tack and grooming equipment, and even water and feed buckets. Humans can also unintentionally carry the virus from horse to horse.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler said she is taking extra precautions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We feel relatively safe, and I’ve secured that safety by not allowing any other horses to come on the ranch right now, and so we feel pretty good, but we’re still engineering sanitization more,” Butler said. “We’re not even letting you go from horse to horse feeding carrots.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veterinary diagnostician Semira Mancill with the &lt;a href="https://tvmdl.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; said EHV-1 cases have already appeared closer to the Houston area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are some affected horses in our area,” Mancill said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mancill urged horse owners to take temperatures twice a day and watch closely for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically with EHV-1, they’re going to get respiratory signs, so snotty nose, coughing, lethargy, depression, maybe going off feed,” Mancill said. “In 10 to 20% of these horses, it’s going to progress into the neurological form that we’re seeing in this outbreak right now, which can be quite serious.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mancill said horses have died during this current outbreak, though the total number remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler said she and her team are watching their horses closely and doing day-to-day monitoring to make sure the horses are all okay.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a horse looks lethargic at all, has a little snotty nose, is moving a little funny, we’ll start doing temperature-taking on those horses really quick,” Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo&lt;/a&gt; told KHOU 11 that it is working with state officials and veterinary experts to monitor the situation. With the event still months away, all HLSR equine competitions remain scheduled as planned.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts said the best defense against EHV-1 is limiting travel, avoiding shared equipment and alerting a veterinarian immediately if any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. A first-of-its-kind study in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve memory test scores in people over age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published early last year, the findings are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-your-sense-of-smell-may-be-an-early-sign-of-alzheimers"&gt;early signs of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double-blind trial tested two inexpensive plant-fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/probiotics-vs-prebiotics-whats-the-difference-and-do-you-need-both"&gt;Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables&lt;/a&gt; that help stimulate &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;our gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/117-year-old-womans-diet-could-help-us-all-live-longer"&gt;117-Year-Old Woman's Diet Could Help Us All Live Longer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the supplements was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;, a dietary fiber in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructan"&gt;fructan&lt;/a&gt; class. The other, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low-calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look into how these supplements affect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-critical-age-when-your-thinking-begins-to-decline"&gt;the aging brain&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins, all at least 60 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split: one twin received a daily prebiotic mixed into protein powder, while the other received a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="182065" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twins who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the daily fiber supplements were linked to subtle changes in the gut microbiome between twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beneficial &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925/full"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, were more plentiful in those taking inulin or FOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on mice suggest &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00652"&gt;reduces cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt; by regulating gut-brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mary Ni Lochlainn, a geriatric medicine researcher at King's College London, when the findings were published in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily for longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King's College is home to the United Kingdom's largest adult twin registry, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/identical-twins-mystery-when-1-has-dementia-both-face-a-shorter-life"&gt;twin studies are highly valuable&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to differentiating between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/identical-twins-can-have-significant-iq-differences-shock-study-reveals"&gt;the effect of genetics and the environment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pair-of-twins-raised-in-different-countries-reveal-significantly-different-cognitive-abilities"&gt;on human health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182714" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/gut_microbiome_with_inset_642.jpg" alt="Diagram of human intestines in the background, with gut bacteria shown in a circle at the foreground" class="size-full wp-image-182714" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/gut_microbiome_with_inset_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/gut_microbiome_with_inset_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182714" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The microbes in each person's gut make up their individual microbiome.

Some experts are now so convinced by the results, they &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/gut-brain"&gt;refer to the gut&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-rhythms-between-your-stomach-and-brain-could-shape-your-mood"&gt;the body's 'second brain'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the way these two nervous systems work together remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin study at KCL hints that consuming certain '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-eggs-might-protect-brain-health-and-lower-cholesterol"&gt;brain foods&lt;/a&gt;' could be a promising way to treat cognitive decline, adding to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-key-food-nutrients-linked-to-slower-brain-aging"&gt;research suggesting key food nutrients&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain"&gt;may be able to slow its progress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These plant fibers, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash-strapped times.

But health officials took claims of the benefits a major step forward, indicating the therapy can also prevent heart disease, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There may be no other medication in the modern era that can improve the health outcomes of women on a population level than hormone replacement therapy,” Makary said, calling it a “life-changing, even life-saving treatment” and positioning the announcement as a “medical breakthrough”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other officials at the press conference offered similarly rosy perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hormone therapy is “extending the lives for as much as 10 years”, said &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Today, we have the opportunity to add up to a decade of healthy years to the life of every woman that you love,” said Alicia Jackson, head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and founder of Evernow, a startup that provides virtual menopause care. “Estrogen is one of the most effective longevity interventions for women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet there is no evidence that hormone therapy has benefits among the wider population of menopausal women beyond those who have symptoms, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“To make that blanket statement that every woman should take this to prevent heart disease – it’s not true,” said Lauren Streicher, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology and founding medical director of the Center for Sexual Medicine and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/menopause" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Menopause&lt;/a&gt; at the Northwestern University school of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The “data-free” decision sends a “harmful” and confusing message, said Pauline Maki, professor of psychiatry, psychology and obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Illinois college of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Women are trying desperately to get the truth, and they’re having a really difficult time,” she said. When it comes to using menopause hormone therapy for dementia, her area of expertise, “the harm is maybe real, but certainly it’s not showing benefit”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An HHS spokesperson said that “randomized studies show that women who initiate HRT within 10 years of the onset of menopause (generally before age 60) have a reduction in all-cause mortality and fractures”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS did not respond to questions about officials’ statements on purported protection against dementia and other issues or the evidence for using the medications widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is the first time the FDA has relied on a roundtable panel, which was not open to public comments in advance, to inform their regulatory decision-making, &lt;a href="https://insights.citeline.com/pink-sheet/drug-safety/makarys-expert-panel-sparks-regulatory-action-for-menopause-hormonal-therapy-GV4D4PKRVFHSZEICZVQ7X3IITM/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to Pink Sheet. Streicher, who has long advocated for changes to the black-box warning, was going to be on the panel in July, but after a few preliminary meetings, she dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It became very clear to me that this was not going to be a scientific panel. This isn’t the scientific approach,” she said. “I said: ‘I’m out. I don’t want any part of this.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Streicher attended the press conference earlier this month. “They were trying to get people to pack the room,” she said. The organizers urged attendees to wear their white coats to give the event the imprimatur of expertise, Streicher said. She didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She says she’s worried about the precedent set by the decision. The agency is also re-examining medications like mifepristone, which is a safe and effective medication for abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It was very clear that Makary already had an agenda, that he was going to want to remove these labels, and was just kind of doing this public discourse of passionate people saying: ‘This is why it should happen,’” she said. “They handpick the people who they know are going to say what they want them to say.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Makary’s most recent book has a chapter on hormone replacement therapy, titled OMG HRT, arguing that hormone therapy has been shown to “increase a woman’s longevity by three years”. The more accepted medical term for the treatment for women over 40 is menopause hormone therapy (MHT). The July &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;panel&lt;/a&gt; included researchers who have published on menopause as well as doctors with large social media followings; no oncologists participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The process involved letting panelists “express their opinions”, Makary said, followed by a literature review at FDA and the recommendation to “remove certain blackbox warnings”, which Makary himself signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Typically, expert advisory committees hold public discussions on the evidence and then make recommendations to the FDA, which subject-matter experts at the agency – rarely the commissioner – may or may not accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The FDA opted for the panel because advisory committee meetings are “bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive”, Makary said in response to a question about the process. More panels with guests who “​​speak [their] mind passionately” will happen in the future, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The evidence itself on the medications is nuanced. Streicher notes “there’s really two very separate issues, and they muddy those”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Local vaginal estrogen, which is usually a cream, tablet, insert, suppository or vaginal ring, treats symptoms like dryness and irritation as well as recurrent urinary tract infections and urgency. “Those products are really totally safe,” Streicher said, adding that they never should have had the warning applied to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Systemic estrogen is more complicated. There are many preparations, applications and ways it’s metabolized. Some specific medications do have risks – oral estrogen, for example, increases the risk of getting a blood clot, while a transdermal patch doesn’t. These labels need to be modified in a thoughtful, product-specific way, Streicher said. There’s also a small increased risk of breast cancer with synthetic progesterone. The medications are not suitable for everyone, especially people with a history of breast or uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Maki, a leading researcher on menopause and dementia, once believed memory issues could be linked to the loss of estrogen that occurs during menopause. Research indicated that women who used hormone therapy to treat menopause symptoms saw improvements to their memory. Maki conducted a large randomized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17893293/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; among a bigger group of menopausal women, not just those with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Far from showing benefit, it actually showed a trend toward harm,” Maki said. Three other large randomized trials had similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms like hot flashes can be incredibly disruptive, with three-quarters of sufferers saying they have trouble sleeping – which can contribute to memory issues, especially over the course of seven or eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Maki now believes that treating those symptoms – whether with hormone therapy or other medications – is key to improving memory, as demonstrated in another study of hers with a non-hormonal treatment. To use hormone therapy for dementia prevention more widely is “just not based in science”, Maki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="833732f4-62b4-417c-815f-85a2e9354e12" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":29,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"CDC website altered to reflect RFK Jr’s belief in link between vaccines and autism","elementId":"833732f4-62b4-417c-815f-85a2e9354e12","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/cdc-website-vaccines-autism"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet in a “stunning” move, Maki said, health officials cherry-picked data from a small study in one community while ignoring larger randomized trials. Officials positioned the decision as a move against “medical group think” and “medical dogma”, as Makary put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For the first time in a generation, the FDA is standing with science and standing with women,” said Kennedy. “Today, we are restoring integrity to medicine, restoring faith in public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The American medical establishment turned its back on women, said Kennedy, who recently sought to link women’s use of Tylenol in pregnancy to autism. “The label was designed to frighten women and to silence doctors,” Kennedy said, decrying “a culture of fear”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Makary said the decision was “challenging the paternalism of medicine”, but then said hormone therapy “​​has saved marriages”, indicating that one of the key outcomes of the medication is marital satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It was not only scientifically wrong, but it was offensive,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hormone therapy is safe and effective for those with menopause symptoms, she said: “But do I tell every single woman who goes through menopause that she needs to be on hormone therapy? Absolutely not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5yOVF2NnJqblVWNG5nUHhQYXNNOVh4WXE2Q0ZlTzk3dVFLeUVoUlRzeEFqR3pxZ1ZRc05xdGdkLXVwS0U4Y2hKOTk1NjRqVGFLWGFEeDR5RjRyaHFuX0RORlJ6azhSV3pBS1pydmVrS2MtaWltYjdQQk1od1V2dw</guid></item><item><title>为什么筛查美国最致命的癌症漏掉了大多数病例--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/24/lung-cancer-screening-guidelines/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TCQFICVZ3FF7DMYOQJXOAUXWQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Jessie Creel’s cough started in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GQSCXSIJSRHXRFLKRRWNQIGY3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the time, a primary care physician diagnosed the mother of three with pneumonia.

For many, these shifts might be more than hormonal; they might be dealing with winter depression, a form of Seasonal affective disorder. Seasonal affective disorders or SAD, only occur during cold and darker months. Recognising early signs and learning how to deal with mental health during this time can make a big difference in how one navigates through this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding winter depression&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter depression is believed to be related to changes in light exposure and the body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm. With little or no amount of sunlight available, our brains start to make less serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, and starts to produce more melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep. These significant chemical changes can lead to symptoms such as unwanted fatigue, sadness or lack of motivation to work. Anyone can go through winter depression, but it occurs more commonly in people who live far from the equator, where winters are longer and daylight, shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Morning habits to cut depression risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a simpler language, Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), winter type, is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes most commonly occurring in autumn or winter and remitting in spring/summer. The syndrome has been well-known for more than three decades, with light treatment being the treatment of first choice, according to NHS, UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research paper mentioned in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5138072/#sec12" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;has carefully evaluated each and every possible treatment for this disease and in this research there were two models: they experience physical symptoms (like changes in sleep, appetite, and energy) and psychological symptoms (such as low mood or negative thinking). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different treatments target these vulnerabilities in different ways, which is why some people respond better to one therapy than another.Many people have benefited with bright light therapy, which is now considered the first-choice treatment. Antidepressants such as SSRI and bupropion have also shown positive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes SAD&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production of melatonin – Melatonin is a hormone that makes you feel sleepy; in people with SAD, the body may produce it in higher-than-normal levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production of serotonin – Serotonin is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite and sleep; a lack of sunlight may lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to feelings of depression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) – The body uses sunlight to time various important functions, such as when you wake up, so lower light levels during the winter may disrupt your body clock and lead to symptoms of SAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early signs to watch out for&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadness: Most days, feeling down emotionally or for no apparent reasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of interest in other activities: Activities that we once enjoyed, seems dull and boring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in sleeping pattern: Sleeping more than usual or never wanting to get up; mornings are especially hard to face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight fluctuations and cravings: Many people develop cravings for carbohydrates or gain weight during winter months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategies to protect your mental health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are indeed some practical ways with which one can minimise the effect of Winter depression and keeping emotions in place. The following strategies can be implemented in daily life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maximise sunlight exposure: Natural light can regulate mood. Even spending short periods outdoor, like going for a morning walk, sitting near a window and simply opening curtains during the day can enhance mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stick to a routine: Keep a regular pattern of sleep, mealtimes, and activities, which can help maintain your body's circadian rhythm. Going to bed and getting up at approximately the same time daily, planning your meals in advance, and planning small activities may provide you with a sense of control and stability that helps fight off seasonal mood changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consume balanced meals: Our favourite and comfort food sounds much appealing in winters, but a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and omega-3 helps to maintain brain health, and enhances mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Remember, it is nothing that cannot be reversed. With the right techniques, even seasonal affective disorder can be conquered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAJBVV95cUxOWVktYkVtVEtnd2RJbWVtVGFkTTRLUG9KdW42aHJzczA0SEcwQmQ1eDFETzFkYTdyTkctMDA4dWFyYXJNWjFScXRDT0h1cVRYbXdNVTJIWGRvTTJlVkE0VXRrTG1QU1d0aVhBbFlQOXV4VjZkZGs0ZHJaLXQwMklWa1BMQU5FWHQ1NVFhMC1uQndxV3NRV050NUhUbnF2anpFSTNuM3VZS0RIRGs2WjhrMjZtUHlURFRNTHcxWUZ6Y08zcWZCTnp1U3VLSGZuQlgzQXVIVDZ3RVVEWWp0bk9ZazlydEpDRDhsNDBreS05aUNoY1dGd2VYMUpCLTRBUzJDQ0J4aExzUzg</guid></item><item><title>科学家确定了一种脂肪衍生的激素，它可以驱动运动对情绪的好处- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/scientists-identify-a-fat-derived-hormone-that-drives-the-mood-benefits-of-exercise/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that a single thirty-minute session of physical activity can produce immediate antidepressant effects in both humans and mice. The research identifies a specific biological pathway involving a hormone released by fat cells that alters brain plasticity to improve mood. These findings suggest that short-term exercise could serve as an accessible intervention for alleviating depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder places a significant burden on global health systems and affects millions of individuals. Current pharmaceutical treatments often require weeks or even months to become effective and can carry unwanted side effects. While consistent physical activity is recognized for its mental health benefits, the immediate impact of a single exercise session is less understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific community lacks a complete picture of the neurobiological processes that translate physical movement into rapid mood elevation. The study aimed to map the specific cellular and molecular events that occur in the brain following acute exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression is one of the most devastating disorders, contributing significantly to disability worldwide. Although regular physical exercise is recognized for its antidepressant effects, the immediate impact of a single bout of exercise has often been overlooked, with limited mechanistic evidence supporting its benefits,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.sonatayau.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sonata Suk-yu Yau&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and a principle investigator in the Mental Health Research Center at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rapid-acting antidepressant treatments that offer sustained effects and minimal side effects remain scarce. This issue is particularly concerning given the rising prevalence of adolescent depression, highlighting the importance of non-pharmacological preventative measures to reduce the risk of developing depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides clinical evidence for the effectiveness of a single session of exercise in alleviating depressive symptoms. Additionally, mechanistic support from animal studies demonstrates that a single bout of exercise rapidly increases levels of the adipocyte-secreted hormone adiponectin, which activates neural activity and promotes new spine formation in the prefrontal cortex, ultimately leading to a rapid response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited forty university students and staff for the human portion of the experiment. Half of these participants exhibited symptoms of anxiety or depression based on initial screening, while the other half did not. All individuals completed a thirty-minute running session on a treadmill at a moderate intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological assessments conducted before and after the session showed that the exercise reduced total mood disturbance. Participants reported higher levels of vigor and self-esteem alongside reductions in negative feelings such as tension and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the underlying biology, the team utilized a mouse model designed to simulate depression through chronic unpredictable stress. These mice underwent a similar thirty-minute treadmill protocol. Behavioral tests measured the animals’ motivation and mood states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the forced swim test measures how long a mouse struggles to escape water versus floating passively. The exercised mice displayed significantly reduced depression-like behaviors compared to sedentary controls. This antidepressant response emerged within two hours and persisted for up to twenty-four hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators then examined brain tissue to identify which areas were active during the exercise. They mapped the expression of c-Fos, a protein that indicates recent neuronal activity. This mapping revealed increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. This region plays a significant role in emotion regulation and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis pinpointed the specific type of cells activated within this region. The study showed that glutamatergic neurons, which are excitatory nerve cells, were primarily responsible for the increased activity. The researchers sought to determine if this activity was the cause of the mood improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They utilized a technique called chemogenetics, which allows for the remote control of specific cell groups using engineered receptors and specific drugs. They artificially inhibited these specific neurons before the mice exercised. This inhibition prevented the antidepressant effects usually seen after running. This indicates that the activation of these neurons is necessary for the mood benefit. Conversely, chemically activating these neurons in sedentary mice mimicked the antidepressant effects of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team investigated chemical signals that might bridge the gap between the body and the brain. They focused on molecules known as exerkines, which are released by peripheral organs during physical activity. They observed that the exercise session led to elevated levels of adiponectin in the medial prefrontal cortex. Adiponectin is a hormone typically secreted by fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mice, the rise in brain adiponectin levels correlated directly with the reduction in depression-like behavior. This suggests a communication pathway where the body signals the brain to regulate mood. The study established that the glutamatergic neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex possess receptors specifically for adiponectin, known as AdipoR1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers genetically removed these receptors, the exercise no longer produced an antidepressant response. This confirmed that the hormone must bind to these specific receptors to initiate the mood-regulating process. The team then looked inside the neurons to understand what happened after the receptor was activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tracked a protein known as APPL1. Under normal conditions, APPL1 resides in the cell’s main body, or cytoplasm. The data showed that following exercise, adiponectin signaling caused APPL1 to move into the cell nucleus. This translocation peaked approximately two hours after the exercise session ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside the nucleus, APPL1 appeared to influence how DNA is packaged and read. This process is known as epigenetic regulation. The study found increased acetylation of histone H4, a chemical change that loosens the DNA structure to allow for gene expression. This modification essentially unlocks specific genetic instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process led to the increased production of proteins essential for building connections between neurons. These proteins included components necessary for synaptic transmission. Consequently, the researchers observed the formation of new dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are small protrusions on neurons that receive signals from other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of new spines indicates a physical rewiring of the brain, known as neural plasticity. Blocking the movement of APPL1 into the nucleus prevented both the formation of these new connections and the antidepressant behavioral effects. This links the molecular journey of APPL1 directly to the structural changes in the brain and the subsequent improvement in mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that “a single bout of exercise lasting 30 minutes at moderate intensity is effective in alleviating depressive mood,” Yau told PsyPost. “Physical exercise is one of the most accessible and low-cost interventions for immediately reducing depressive symptoms, and it may also be effective in preventing the development of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes some caveats. The human trial involved a relatively small sample size of university students, which may not represent the general clinical population or those with severe depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the animal mechanisms were primarily explored in male mice. It remains unclear whether female mice share the exact same biological pathways, as hormonal differences can influence depression and exercise responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our long-term goal is to provide robust scientific evidence for both the acute and sustained beneficial effects of physical exercise in alleviating depressive mood among the general population with mood disturbances, as well as patients with depression,” Yau explained. “As a next step, we plan to investigate the optimal intensity and shortest duration of a single bout of exercise to enhance its practicality and accessibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we aim to examine the influence of gender and age on the response to single-bout exercise. Ultimately, our objective is to develop population-based guidelines with optimal single-bout exercise prescriptions for mood improvement, serving as an effective strategy to prevent the development of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1" target="_blank"&gt;Rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout exercise is mediated by adiponectin-induced APPL1 nucleus translocation in anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tong Cheng, Formolo Douglas Affonso, Jiasui Yu, Yunxiao Zhong, Zonghao Ma, Akhlaq Hussain, Formolo Natalia Paludo Silveira, Li Zhang, Kenneth King-yip Cheng, Georg S.

By combining both, our model aims to accurately predict variant impact across the proteome at single-residue resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, we first introduce the models (referred to here as evo models) used for identifying patterns of conservation across diverse organisms. These models provide a ‘fitness’ score for a given sequence of interest by obtaining an estimate for the log odds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\sigma =\log \left(\frac{p({\boldsymbol{x}})}{p({{\boldsymbol{x}}}^{{\rm{ref}}})}\right)\,,$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;All models used in this work make the false assumption that the training data is independently and identically distributed. This independently and identically distributed assumption breaks down owing to phylogenetic and ascertainment biases. The fact that the VAE is trained on aligned data presents an opportunity to correct for these two biases with sequence reweighting.

                  &lt;p&gt;The transformer architecture has enabled the training of single, alignment-free models of essentially all known proteins.

During training, each sequence has a randomly sampled fraction of its amino acids replaced with a ‘mask’ token, and the network is then trained to predict the amino acids that have been masked. For each masked amino acid, the negative log likelihood of the missing amino acid, conditioned on the sequence context, is independently minimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ6" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\mathcal{L}}={{\mathbb{E}}}_{x \sim X}{{\mathbb{E}}}_{M}\sum _{i\in M}-\log p({x}_{i}| {x}_{/M})\,.$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;
                    (6)
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, for the model to successfully perform this task, the dependencies between the masked amino acid and the unmasked sequence context must be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec32"&gt;Estimating variant-level constraint in humans using Gaussian processes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models described above perform well for ranking variants within a given gene but are not effective at comparing variants across genes (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). This limitation is expected, particularly for alignment-based models, which are trained independently for each coding region. Although several models provide genome-wide scores (for example, Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Fig2"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;), none have been explicitly designed to rank variant severity across the proteome. To address this gap, we introduced popEVE, the first model aimed at proteome-wide comparison of missense variant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to above, we define the evo score from one of the evo models, which we index &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;, with &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(A\in \left\{1,2\right\}\)&lt;/span&gt;, as the log odds between the sequence of interest &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and some reference sequence &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ7" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\sigma }^{A}=\log \left(\frac{{p}^{A}({\boldsymbol{x}})}{{p}^{A}({{\boldsymbol{x}}}^{{\rm{ref}}})}\right)\,.$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;
                    (7)
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what follows, sequences that differ from the reference sequence by a single amino acid substitution have a special role, so it is convenient to define &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({({\sigma }_{i}^{\alpha })}_{n}^{A}\)&lt;/span&gt; as the score from model &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; for a protein sequence, which differs from the reference &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{x}}}_{n}^{{\rm{ref}}}\)&lt;/span&gt; sequence for protein &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; solely by having amino acid &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; at position &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect the probability of observing a sequence in the population to depend, in a fairly simple manner, on the score from the underlying evo models. We adopt a simple Bayesian, non-linear, non-parametric approach to modeling this relationship, with the use of a Bernoulli likelihood and a latent Gaussian process. Specifically, we model the presence or absence of the variant in the UKBB as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ8" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${p}_{n}^{A}(\;{y}_{i}^{\alpha }| {\sigma }_{in}^{\alpha A})=\,\text{Ber}\,\left({y}_{in}^{\alpha }| \varphi (\;{f}_{n}^{A}({\sigma }_{in}^{\alpha A}))\right)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;
                    (8)
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({y}_{ijk}\in \left\{1,0\right\}\)&lt;/span&gt; indicates the presence or absence of a variant in the UKBB, the link function &lt;i&gt;φ&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;span class="stix"&gt;⋅&lt;/span&gt;) is the inverse logit function (also referred to as the logistic function) &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\varphi (z)=\exp (z){(1+\exp (z))}^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt; and the function &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({f}_{n}^{A}(\sigma )\)&lt;/span&gt; is drawn from a Gaussian process prior:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ9" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$f(\sigma ) \sim GP(m(\sigma ),{\mathcal{K}}(\sigma ,{\sigma }^{{\prime} })),$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;
                    (9)
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;with zero mean function &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;) = 0 and radial basis function kernel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ10" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\mathcal{K}}(\sigma ,{\sigma }^{{\prime} })=\exp \left(-\gamma {(\sigma -{\sigma }^{{\prime} })}^{2}\right).$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;
                    (10)
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inferred function &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({f}_{n}^{A}(\sigma )\)&lt;/span&gt; can be thought of as a new fitness score. The intuition is that by modeling the amount of variation seen per protein in the UKBB or gnomAD, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({f}_{n}^{A}(\sigma )\)&lt;/span&gt; it essentially rescales the evo score &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\sigma }_{n}^{A}\)&lt;/span&gt; to account for the degree of constraint acting on a per-variant basis in the population, and how that constraint depends on &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\sigma }_{n}^{A}\)&lt;/span&gt;; thus resulting in a score that can rank the pathogenicity of variants across different coding regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Efficient function inference by restoring conjugacy with Pólya-gamma data augmentation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each protein of interest, indexed &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, and each underlying evo model, indexed &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;, we seek to infer the functions &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({f}_{n}^{A}\)&lt;/span&gt;. To do so, we consider the scores of all possible single amino acid substitutions in that protein and their corresponding labels &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({y}_{in}^{\alpha }\)&lt;/span&gt;, indicating if that variant has been observed, or not, in the UKBB (we also provide a version of the model trained on gnomAD instead of the UKBB). Dropping the indices &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; for compactness, we denote the training data as the set of scores &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\boldsymbol{\sigma }}=[{\sigma }_{1}^{1},\ldots ,{\sigma }_{L}^{19}]\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\boldsymbol{y}}=[{y}_{1},\ldots ,{y}_{N}]\in {\left\{0,1\right\}}^{N}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; is the number of amino acids in the protein and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 19&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; is the total number of possible single amino acid substitutions. Let &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; = [&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;] be the function values corresponding to the input &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, then equation (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="equation anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Equ8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;), together with the Gaussian process prior for &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, implies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ11" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$p(\;{\boldsymbol{f}}| {\boldsymbol{y}},{\boldsymbol{\sigma }})\propto p(\;{\boldsymbol{y}}| {\;\boldsymbol{f}\;})p(\;{\boldsymbol{f}\;}| {\boldsymbol{\sigma }})\,,$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;

Therefore, in contrast to models with a Gaussian process prior and a Gaussian likelihood, inference is analytically intractable because the Gaussian prior is not conjugate to the Bernoulli likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One appealing approach to overcoming this issue is to introduce additional latent variables that restore conjugacy.

                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal then is to find a prior &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;ω&lt;/i&gt;) to satisfy two properties: that when marginalizing out &lt;i&gt;ω&lt;/i&gt;, the original model is recovered; and the Gaussian prior &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;) is conjugate to the likelihood &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="stix"&gt;∣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;ω&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;).

Our setup provides a novel opportunity to build a highly performant ensemble model by incorporating the scores from multiple evo models.

We define the popEVE score &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\bar{\sigma }\)&lt;/span&gt; to simply be the mean of the means of the posteriors of each GP, for each evo model whose domain contains the variant of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ19" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\bar{\sigma }}_{ij}^{{\rm{\alpha }}}=\frac{1}{{Q}_{ij}^{A}}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{A=1}^{{Q}_{ij}^{\alpha }}{\mathbb{E}}\left[{f}_{j}^{A}({\sigma }_{i}^{\alpha })\right]\,,$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;

To assess the ability to separate benign from pathogenic variants, we made use of two curated sets of ClinVar labels as described in ‘ClinVar benign and pathogenic variants’. We computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for all genes with at least five benign and five pathogenic labels. With these sets, we were able to assess the performance across 50 and 31 proteins and in 2019 and 2020 datasets, respectively (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Fig8"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec39"&gt;Comparing model performance across proteins&lt;/h4&gt;
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar4"&gt;Ranking clinical pathogenic variants by severity&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To evaluate how well models rank clinical pathogenic variants by severity, we assembled a set of ClinVar 1+ star variants linked to phenotypes with childhood or adult onset or death, based on OrphaNet annotations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Schaefer, J., Lehne, M., Schepers, J., Prasser, F. &amp;amp; Thun, S.

For each model, we identified the 5th percentile score threshold for benign ClinVar variants and used this as a reference. We then compared the log odds of childhood-versus-adult-associated pathogenic variants falling below this threshold. Pairwise &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-scores and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were computed to assess whether model differences were statistically significant. Models focused solely on pathogenicity are expected to perform poorly, whereas those capturing variant fitness and phenotypic severity should distinguish between childhood and adult onset variants.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar5"&gt;Distinguishing SDD cases from unaffected controls&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We next evaluated the model’s ability to rank variant severity across the proteome and across individuals. To do so, we constructed a test set from de novo variants found in patients with SDDs and unaffected siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The goal was to determine whether the model could distinguish cases carrying likely pathogenic de novo variants from controls with variants not expected to contribute to disease.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We defined ‘cases’ as individuals with at least one de novo variant in a known DD gene (DDG2P, downloaded January 2023), following the approach of a previous publication&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Kaplanis, J. et al.

However, only a subset of these variants is expected to be truly pathogenic. Based on an observed excess of 2,982 de novo missense variants among 5,625 cases, we estimate that approximately 53% carry a causal variant. Accordingly, we adjusted the maximum achievable recall to reflect this expected upper bound.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;This test set (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;) allows us to benchmark model performance in a realistic clinical setting. popEVE outperforms all current state-of-the-art models for pathogenicity prediction, including the underlying evolutionary models it builds upon (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Fig3"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;, Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Fig16"&gt;9a&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar6"&gt;Assessing overprediction of deleterious variants in the general population&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We evaluated each model’s ability to recover SDD cases from de novo mutations or WES while minimizing false positives in the general population. For each model and score threshold, we computed the percentage of individuals in the UKBB and SDD metacohort (or DDD sub-cohort) with at least one variant as or more pathogenic (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Fig2"&gt;2h,k&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#MOESM1"&gt;10d,f&lt;/a&gt;), comparing the cumulative distributions between cases and controls.

                  &lt;p&gt;To assess prioritization of causal variants, we calculated the fraction of DDD individuals whose de novo variant was ranked more pathogenic than all inherited variants at each threshold. At −5.056, 513 individuals had a qualifying variant, and in 98% of cases, it ranked as the most deleterious. The rate of decay reflects each model’s genome-wide ranking ability.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec40"&gt;Analysis of patient data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explored two approaches to analyzing de novo mutations from a metacohort composed of subjects from the DDD study, GeneDx and Radboud Medical Center in the hope that popEVE may provide novel evidence for the genetic diagnosis of currently unsolved cases: burden testing of variants per gene across the full cohort, and per-patient direct case–variant association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec41"&gt;Direct case–variant association&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the set of de novo variants from cases and controls, we constructed a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to determine a score cutoff as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ20" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\begin{array}{rcl}{{\mathbf{\mu }}}_{1}&amp;amp; \sim &amp;amp;{\mathcal{N}}({{\mathbf{\mu }}}_{0},{{\mathbf{\Sigma }}}_{0})\\ {{\mathbf{\mu }}}_{2}&amp;amp; \sim &amp;amp;{\mathcal{N}}({{\mathbf{\mu }}}_{0},{{\mathbf{\Sigma }}}_{0})\\ {\lambda }_{1}&amp;amp; \sim &amp;amp;\,\text{Lognormal}\,({\mu }_{\lambda },{\sigma }_{\lambda })\\ {\lambda }_{2}&amp;amp; \sim &amp;amp;\,\text{Lognormal}\,({\mu }_{\lambda },{\sigma }_{\lambda })\\ {\mathbf{\pi }}&amp;amp; \sim &amp;amp;\,\text{Dirichlet}\,({\mathbf{\alpha }})\\ \,\text{For}\,i=1,\ldots ,N:\\ \hspace{0.5em}{a}_{i}&amp;amp; \sim &amp;amp;\,\text{Categorical}\,({\mathbf{\pi }})\\ \hspace{0.5em}{{\bf{x}}}_{i}&amp;amp; \sim &amp;amp;{\mathcal{N}}({{\mathbf{\mu }}}_{{a}_{i}},{\lambda }_{{a}_{i}})\end{array}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__number"&gt;

We then identified an uncertainty cutoff corresponding to a greater than 99.99% likelihood of being in the lower fitness distribution, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\bar{\sigma }\le -5.056\)&lt;/span&gt;. We found that constructing the model with solely the de novo variants from the cases resulted in a similar threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the threshold &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\bar{\sigma }\le -5.056\)&lt;/span&gt;, we searched the full DD cohort for individuals with at least one de novo missense variant below this score and no predicted LoF variants. For these individuals, we consider the identified missense variant a strong candidate for being causal. In addition to the high accuracy of the Gaussian mixture model, these variants show strong enrichment relative to the background mutation rate (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02400-1#Fig3"&gt;3d&lt;/a&gt;), further supporting their likely pathogenicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec42"&gt;Gene-collapsing model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare with previous methods, we implemented gene-collapsing models for the SDD cohort following the DeNovoWEST framework&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Kaplanis, J. et al.

Diet fizzy drinks, sugar-free chewing gum, flavoured yoghurts and even protein powders are filled with low-calorie substitutes that promise sweetness without the usual glucose spike. Their popularity has grown especially among individuals managing diabetes or trying to limit sugar intake, reflecting a wider shift toward reduced sugar diets. As research continues to expand, scientists are beginning to pay closer attention to how these sweeteners behave inside the body. A new wave of studies now suggests that the effects might extend beyond metabolic processes and into areas linked to memory, learning and how the brain ages over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why scientists first questioned how artificial sweeteners affect the brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in the neurological impact of artificial sweeteners started to rise when researchers noticed patterns that did not fully match earlier assumptions. Instead of passing through the body with little involvement beyond the digestive system, some compounds appeared to interact with neural pathways that help shape attention and memory. These observations encouraged scientists to look more closely at how repeated consumption might influence biological processes that tend to shift as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also led to new questions about whether taste receptors in the gut, bloodstream and brain respond in ways that subtly change cognitive behaviour. This curiosity provided the groundwork for larger studies designed to examine how diet habits might relate to long term brain health in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sugar-sweetened drinks related to chronic kidney disease, says study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How sweeteners influence memory and brain function&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study in the journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; brought fresh attention to the topic by analysing how often people consumed sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol and acesulfame K. By comparing dietary patterns with cognitive testing, researchers identified a consistent link between higher intake and reduced performance across several areas of thinking. The results did not claim direct harm, but they highlighted shifts that resembled the equivalent of roughly 1.6 additional years of brain ageing. This pattern caught attention because it suggested that frequent exposure might influence subtle cognitive functions that people usually notice only later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher daily intake showed a clear association with reduced memory performance across multiple tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinking speed and overall cognitive fluency appeared lower among frequent consumers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pattern resembled mild early ageing effects rather than severe decline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several different sweeteners showed similar associations, suggesting the effect may be broad rather than ingredient-specific&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The link remained visible even after adjusting for typical lifestyle factors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How consuming sweeteners makes your brain age faster&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings sparked discussion, researchers emphasised that the study did not prove that artificial sweeteners directly cause neurological decline. Instead, they suggested that these additives might interact with broader systems that contribute to cognitive changes over time. Many scientists already study how diet influences inflammation, metabolic signalling and oxidative stress, all of which relate to long-term brain resilience. Repeated exposure to ultra-sweet compounds may influence these pathways in ways that are still being mapped out. This perspective has encouraged more collaboration between nutrition researchers and neurologists, who see value in understanding how everyday diet choices might accumulate over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary habits influence inflammation levels, which can affect cognitive ageing patterns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweetness receptors in the gut and brain may respond to artificial compounds differently from natural sugars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic stress linked to diet can shape how neural cells repair themselves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earlier research has shown that subtle dietary signals sometimes influence behaviour before symptoms appear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term exposure, even within recommended limits, may add up in ways scientists are only beginning to analyse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why researchers urge caution even when sweeteners are approved&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory approval for ingredients such as aspartame, sucralose and saccharin primarily reflects research on cancer risk, toxicity thresholds and metabolic safety. These reviews were essential, but they were not designed to evaluate slow-developing neurological patterns. As daily consumption has increased dramatically over the past two decades, scientists argue that cognitive outcomes deserve the same level of scrutiny that metabolic effects once received. Many people consume sweeteners multiple times a day without realising how varied their sources are, which makes long-term tracking more complex. This is one reason researchers believe that brain health should now be part of the wider conversation about sweetener safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why studying the link between sweeteners and brain ageing is important&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;New investigations are exploring several possible pathways that might explain why cognitive changes appear in frequent consumers. One area of interest is the gut-brain axis, which describes how gut bacteria communicate with neural circuits through chemical signals. Some sweeteners can alter the balance of these bacteria, raising the possibility that microbiome shifts influence thinking patterns. Other scientists are studying whether artificial sweet compounds affect neural excitability, which relates to how efficiently brain cells send signals. Inflammatory pathways are also under review because chronic low-level inflammation is already recognised as a factor in age-related cognitive decline. These early findings point to subtle but meaningful questions about how repeated exposure shapes brain function across the lifespan. Although much more research is needed, the direction of current studies suggests that the brain health impact of artificial sweeteners will remain an active area of scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;As the year winds down, it's easy to fall into survival mode. Late nights, indulgent meals, and travel can take a toll on your body and brain. But instead of waiting for the post-holiday slump, you can invest in yourself – literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;b&gt;12 scientifically backed ways to &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;gift yourself this holiday season &lt;/b&gt;that can boost brainpower, improve health, and keep you energized well into the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Dance Lessons.&lt;/b&gt; Complex physical activities that combine coordination, memory, and strategy – like learning dance steps – are shown to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-type-of-activity-is-particularly-effective-at-keeping-your-brain-young"&gt;slow brain aging and boost cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;. New research highlights that pairing aerobic exercise with mental engagement is one of the most effective ways to protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A Bike.&lt;/strong&gt; Short, intense bouts of cycling (a form of high-intensity interval training) can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;a cognitive boost that can last for several years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cycling-linked-to-lower-risk-of-dementia-study-of-half-a-million-finds"&gt;Studies also link regular cycling to a 40 percent lower risk of early onset dementia&lt;/a&gt;, making it the perfect excuse to hit the pedals.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/BikeMinutPhys_1024.jpg" alt="Watch: How do bikes stay up without a rider?" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-52014" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/BikeMinutPhys_1024.jpg" alt="Watch: How do bikes stay up without a rider?" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-52014" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148123" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/WomenOnSpinBikes642.jpg" alt="New Year's Resolutions Didn't Stick in 2024?

Legumes like lentils, quinoa, brown rice, and oats are linked to longer telomeres, and can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-suggests-that-changing-your-diet-could-add-a-decade-to-your-life"&gt;add up to 10 years to your life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Trivia Game. &lt;/b&gt;Want to test your brainpower? Our friends at Veritasium are developing a &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elements-of-truth/elements-of-truth-by-veritasium"&gt;tabletop game&lt;/a&gt; that challenges you to think like a scientist: Weigh evidence, judge your confidence, and put your knowledge to the test. And if you win, it could be a sign your brain is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-you-really-good-at-trivia-your-brain-might-be-particularly-well-wired"&gt;wired for efficiency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Prebiotic Fiber Supplement. &lt;/b&gt;Taking a daily prebiotic supplement, like inulin, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheap-daily-supplement-appears-to-boost-brain-function-in-older-people"&gt;appears to boost brain function in older people&lt;/a&gt;. These high-fiber compounds feed the gut's 'good' bacteria, which in turn support a healthier, aging brain. Natural sources include bananas, onions, and garlic – and differ from the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/probiotics-vs-prebiotics-whats-the-difference-and-do-you-need-both"&gt;probiotics found in fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; like yogurt or kimchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. A Journal. &lt;/b&gt;If you've been overindulging and want to calm the dreaded 'hangxiety,' keeping a journal can help. Beyond rehydration and rest, studies suggest &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hangxiety-if-you-feel-anxious-after-drinking-this-is-why"&gt;journaling when you wake&lt;/a&gt; puts your feelings into perspective and fosters self-compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Blue Light Blocking Glasses. &lt;/b&gt;Using your phone in bed, especially in the hour before sleep, can seriously disrupt your natural sleep cycle. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-confirms-you-really-should-turn-your-phone-off-at-bedtime"&gt;blue light glasses worn during the evening&lt;/a&gt; boosted melatonin levels by 58 percent and resulted in longer, better-quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182291" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GettyImages-1369066138-642x427.jpg" alt="blue-light glasses worn during the evening, boosted melatonin levels by 58%" class="wp-image-182291 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GettyImages-1369066138-642x427.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GettyImages-1369066138-1014x675.jpg 1014w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GettyImages-1369066138-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GettyImages-1369066138-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GettyImages-1369066138-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GettyImages-1369066138-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182291" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Light at night can disrupt your natural sleep cycle. (Boy_Anupong/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. A Yoga Mat. &lt;/b&gt;Beyond its well-known anxiety-busting benefits, research shows that yoga may also be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-scientists-say"&gt;the most effective exercise for improving sleep quality.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Omega-3 Supplement.&lt;/b&gt; Keep calm and try omega‑3!  Found in fish oil, sardines, salmon, and algae, these fatty acids can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-dietary-supplement-was-shown-to-reduce-aggression-by-up-to-28"&gt;reduce feelings of aggression&lt;/a&gt; and may protect brain health. Emerging studies suggest they could even influence &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/levels-of-omega-3-could-help-explain-womens-alzheimers-risk"&gt;women's risk of developing Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Red Light Therapy Glasses. &lt;/b&gt;Research suggests that a short, daily dose of deep red light (670nm) can help recharge the retina's energy system (mitochondria), leading to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/declining-eyesight-could-be-given-a-boost-by-short-morning-doses-of-seeing-red"&gt;a significant improvement in declining eyesight i&lt;/a&gt;n those over 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Walking Shoes.&lt;/strong&gt; Evidence shows even a modest level of physical activity may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-could-be-slowed-by-taking-as-few-as-5000-steps-a-day"&gt;slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, with a recent study suggesting taking 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day was linked with reduced cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12.

    &lt;p&gt;As the federal government prepares for the next meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has intensified his attacks on aluminum vaccine components used in many shots to boost the body's immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before seeking public office, &lt;a href="https://podscripts.co/podcasts/the-joe-rogan-experience/1999-robert-kennedy-jr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;claims that aluminum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://podscripts.co/podcasts/the-joe-rogan-experience/1999-robert-kennedy-jr&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1763737175066729&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0kM5Ir0tjfudsVdspksPQO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt; adjuvants&lt;/a&gt; are neurotoxic and tied to autism, asthma, autoimmune disease, and &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rfk-jr-says-peanut-allergies-may-be-tied-to-aluminum-in-vaccines-and/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;food allergies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But science and medicine advances a different view. Strong recommendations that parents introduce peanut-containing foods to infants early, for instance, have led to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a drop&lt;/a&gt; in the incidence rate of peanut allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking office, Kennedy has ordered reviews of vaccine ingredients, citing aluminum as a top concern. A discussion of "adjuvants and contaminants" is on the vaccine advisory panel's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; that for years has assured the public vaccines do not cause autism was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-website-change-vaccines-autism/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;updated Nov. 19 with new language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stating that studies have not definitively ruled out a link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also targeted scientists who have published studies showing aluminum adjuvants are safe. In August, Kennedy denounced &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a large Danish study&lt;/a&gt; finding no link between aluminum in vaccines and childhood disease, calling it a "&lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-breaks-down-danish-study-autism-aluminum-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;deceitful propaganda stunt&lt;/a&gt;" and demanding its retraction. The Annals of Internal Medicine rejected the claim and refused to retract the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, regarding the upcoming &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;advisory pane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;l meeting, HHS spokesperson Emily HIlliard said ACIP "is independently reviewing the full body of evidence on adjuvants and other vaccine components to ensure the highest safety standards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high because Kennedy's push to cast doubt on aluminum isn't just about the ingredient itself. It's part of a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-rfk-maha-prasad-vaccine-injury-compensation-program-autism-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;broader strategy&lt;/a&gt; to foster uncertainty about vaccine safety and lay the groundwork to challenge the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccine-injury-compensation-program-autism-rfk-jr/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which drug manufacturers say is essential to ensure a stable market for shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But researchers across infectious diseases, immunology, pediatrics, and epidemiology say the data is clear: Aluminum adjuvants are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aluminum is the third most common element on the Earth's surface," said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "So we're all exposed to aluminum all the time. The water that we drink has aluminum in it. The food that we eat has aluminum in it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines add only a tiny amount of aluminum to the body — a combined total of about 8 milligrams — after the schedule of childhood vaccines is complete. Offit said that over the first 18 years of life, people naturally take in about 400 milligrams of aluminum from everyday sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know why there is so much concern," said Dr. Rajesh Gupta, a former FDA vaccine scientist. "Aluminum gets distributed in the body everywhere. It is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in the urine. So, it is not that aluminum stays in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How they work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aluminum in vaccines isn't foil or metal. It's a compound of aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, that help the vaccine work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a bit like zinc in cold tablets: Patients don't swallow chunks of metal, instead ingesting a zinc salt that dissolves safely in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vaccines, these aluminum salts give the immune system an extra nudge so it learns to recognize the target germ more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When injected, the vaccine stays near the injection site and causes mild, short-lived inflammation that summons immune cells. Those cells pick up the vaccine antigen, a harmless piece of a virus or bacterium, and carry it to nearby lymph nodes. There, the adjuvants show it around like a wanted poster so the body can identify and destroy the germ quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harm HogenEsch, a professor of immunopathology at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, said that aluminum adjuvants work only when they're injected in the same spot as the vaccine ingredient they're meant to boost, to help nearby immune cells learn to recognize the germ. If the two shots are given in different places, he said, "you don't see that effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to Kennedy's claims, scientists say that anything that acts as an adjuvant can, in principle, also boost an allergic response. But that doesn't mean aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are turning children into food-allergic time bombs. Antigens in vaccines such as the hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV proteins are not allergens, and no food proteins are put into vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Animal experiments &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies form the basis of Kennedy's claim that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can create allergies. In these experiments, scientists deliberately sensitize rats or mice by injecting them with a food protein mixed with aluminum. The aluminum strengthens the immune response, but it does not cause an allergy by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the basis for a lot of the experimental mouse models, where you inject a food allergen with an aluminum adjuvant to sensitize the mice," HogenEsch said. "I'm not aware of any food antigen being included in vaccines, and so I don't really see a way by which this could happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, went further, noting that there is no plausible route for vaccines to create a peanut allergy out of thin air. "Someone would have had to mix peanut proteins in with the actual vaccine prior to injection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stefan H. E. Kaufmann, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, said results from mice often don't match what happens in people, because "mice are much easier to push into allergic reactions than humans." In other words, what looks dramatic in a rodent study doesn't automatically apply to human immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in this case, it's "important to distinguish between how aluminum behaves in lab animals versus people," Kaufmann said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond animal models and theoretical scenarios, scientists have looked hard for signals of harm in large human datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859%2822%2900417-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration coordinated by the CDC, reported a slight increase in asthma among children with higher aluminum exposure before age 2, but the association disappeared in further analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That paper was roundly criticized," Offit said. "When they controlled for breastfeeding, the association between asthma and receipt of aluminum-adjuvant-containing vaccines disappeared." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It should have never been published," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kathy Edwards, professor emerita of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that false signals are common when large databases are mined for dozens of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at a hundred different things, just by the law of percentages, some of those may look like there is a signal," she said. "The whole RFK Jr. assessment is really prone to cherry-picking," she said, adding that "there does need to be some kind of basic understanding of statistics for people to interpret this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the 2023 U.S. findings drew attention, scientists at the CDC contacted Dr. Anders Hviid, head of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, to see whether his team could replicate the work.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It makes perfect sense to try to replicate findings of any kind in different data sources," Hviid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Hviid's nationwide Danish study&lt;/a&gt; followed 1.2 million children over two decades, using linked national health registries that record every vaccination and diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our health care system is quite egalitarian. It's free, and there's universal access. And everyone is in these nationwide registers," he said. Their findings: no increased risk of these conditions associated with increasing amounts of aluminum received through the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rare bumps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have documented one genuine reaction to aluminum adjuvants: itchy nodules at the injection site, called "pruritic granulomas." These small bumps are so rare that most allergists and pediatricians will never see a single case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reaction "doesn't lead to something bad, and it really isn't associated with anything other than that local irritation," Edwards said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe these bumps represent a localized immune response — meaning only in the area of the injection, not a body-wide allergy — that is very different from the kind of immediate allergic reaction people treat with antihistamines. These include the reactions driven by food or beestings, when histamine, the body's own alarm signal, floods the system within minutes and causes hives, swelling, or breathing trouble. Kedl said that distinction often gets lost in public debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eliminating aluminum adjuvants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many experts, the real issue is not just whether aluminum is safe but what happens to the entire vaccine program if aluminum adjuvants are stripped out. For many modern vaccines that rely on a single purified protein — such as those for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cassidy-hepatitis-b-vaccine-schedule-change/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hepatitis B,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and HPV — adjuvants are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said that simply swapping in a different adjuvant isn't realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're kind of all built on one another," she said. Once a vaccine has been proved to work and become the standard of care, new or updated versions are generally no longer tested against a placebo in people who should be getting that vaccine. Instead, they're tested against the existing product, which means each approval rests on the one before it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core childhood vaccines would probably have to be reformulated, and large clinical trials would have to be repeated to prove the new products are safe and effective. Meanwhile, production gaps and shortages would have to be managed, potentially for years, while manufacturers and regulators start over — all while diseases such as &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whooping-cough-deaths-us-most-since-2017/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, hepatitis B, and HPV-related cancers gain more room to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The aluminum adjuvants have sort of hit the sweet spot in terms of being effective at inducing a robust antibody response that is protective for those vaccines in which they're being used and being very safe," HogenEsch said. "It would be quite frankly foolish to try to eliminate them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A century of safe use&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DTaP, hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines all contain aluminum adjuvants and have been in use for nearly a century. Large-scale studies show no link between aluminum and systemic allergic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had aluminum adjuvants in vaccines for decades," Edwards said. "I have grandchildren. My grandchildren have received all of their vaccines. And I do not worry about the safety of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If aluminum is falsely cast as the villain and vaccine uptake falls, experts warn, the consequences will not be theoretical: more measles in schools, more meningitis in college dorms, and more young adults dying of cancers that HPV shots could have prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their view, the real danger isn't the trace amounts of a metal that children already encounter every day. It's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;rolling back the protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines have provided for generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the trade-off Offit hopes parents will see. "A choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice," he said. "It's just a choice to take a different risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When you hear the phrase "happy foods," which dishes come to mind? Many people think of sugary desserts or fatty fast foods, says &lt;a href="https://foodandmoodcentre.com.au/team/felice-jacka/" target="_blank"&gt;Felice Jacka &lt;/a&gt;with the Food and Mood Centre at Deakin University, in Geelong, Australia. After all, in the U.S., we celebrate with cake and ice cream. Parties often feature pizza. Our Thanksgiving feasts usually end in an array of pies and whipped cream.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the idea that these foods will make you happy comes &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13591053231168340" target="_blank"&gt;directly from advertisers&lt;/a&gt;, Jacka says. "People are like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/04/nx-s1-5285413/cereal-sugar-kids-advertising-health" target="_blank"&gt;walking wallets to food companies&lt;/a&gt;," and they sell you this myth that eating these foods will make you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's a bit like if you gave someone a glass of champagne. Feels good in the short term, but the long-term impact is the opposite," Jacka says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Food impacts mood&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For the past fifteen years, Jacka and her colleagues have pioneered the field of nutritional psychiatry. They study how various&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/18/1238939706/ultra-processed-food-junk-food-disease-cancer-anxiety-depression-diet" target="_blank"&gt; foods affect people's moods&lt;/a&gt; and mental health. And they've found some foods are uplifting and protect us from depression. While others sour our mood and increase our risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's mounting evidence that sweets and ultra-processed foods fall squarely in the second category.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00383-x" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that people can feel anxious, irritable, angry or lethargic several hours after eating foods packed in refined carbohydrates and sugars. "For example, some weekend mornings, I go to a diner and have a waffle. By 10 o'clock, I feel terrible," says pediatric gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://dental.nyu.edu/faculty/ft/km5994.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kara Margolis &lt;/a&gt;at New York University, who studies how gut health connects to mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And over the long-run — say months and years — too many of these foods may affect your mental health. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39426518/" target="_blank"&gt;Large epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; across several cultures have shown that a diet high in ultra-processed foods and refined carbohydrates &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809727" target="_blank"&gt;raises a person's risk for depression&lt;/a&gt;. "We can see that it's associated with a 20 to 30 percent higher risk," Margolis says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the same time, several &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1028415X.2017.1411320" target="_blank"&gt;randomized control studies &lt;/a&gt;have found that when people remove ultra-processed foods from their diet and replace them with more whole and minimally processed foods,&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y" target="_blank"&gt; their depression decreases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Here's the conundrum: when people &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; these ultra-processed foods make them happier, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003906/" target="_blank"&gt;studies have found&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people tend to eat more of them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Happy microbes, happy people?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So if ice cream, cake and processed French fries aren't the happiest foods out there, what are? Scientists are still trying to nail down that answer. But the doctors and scientists interviewed for this story all pointed to one top candidate: "Whole grains seem to be particularly important," Jacka says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whole grains contain a special type of fiber, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10498976/" target="_blank"&gt;fermentable fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which bacteria in your gut can digest. It improves the health of your microbiome, Margolis explains, by feeding the "good versus bad bacteria." When the microbes eat this fiber, they produce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9498509/" target="_blank"&gt;small molecules&lt;/a&gt; that are linked to a whole host of benefits, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11242198/#:~:text=GPR43%20is%20a%20functional%20receptor,infiltration/activation%20%5B41%5D." target="_blank"&gt;including decreased inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10041598/#:~:text=SCFAs%20and%20obesity,essential%20role%20in%20human%20health.&amp;amp;text=Studies%20have%20revealed%20that%20on,insulin%20sensitivity%20%28Figure%204A%29.&amp;amp;text=While%20SCFA%2Ddependent%20GPR43%20signaling,1%29%20%28Figure%204A%29.&amp;amp;text=Pingitore%20et%20al83%20show,C/protein%20kinase%20C%20pathway." target="_blank"&gt;improved insulin sensitivity,&lt;/a&gt; and better communication between the gut and the brain. All of these effects have been associated with improved mood and a decreased risk of mood disorders, Margolis says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Making the environment in your gut right for good bacteria not only can affect mood, but it can protect you from nearly every medical condition that's been studied," she adds, including heart disease and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So if you are looking to boost your holiday mood, here are a few things to try.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Go home made&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are two fundamental ways you can influence your mood with your diet, says Felice Jacka at Deakin University. "They're both quite independent of each other."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First off, she says, you can cut back on&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/1211165439/low-ultra-processed-foods-diet" target="_blank"&gt; ultra-processed foods.&lt;/a&gt; That includes foods with added preservatives, artificial sweeteners, refined carbohydrates and white flours, natural and artificial flavors, and emulsifiers, such as soy lecithin, xanthan gum and guar gum.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over Thanksgiving, skip the store-bought pastries, pies, crackers, and white breads. Avoid fast-food pizzas and burgers. Try making your favorite foods in your kitchen with traditional ingredients, Jacka says. "For example, make a beautiful, flour-free cake using almond meal and honey. It's still going to be sweet, but it's going to be a heck of a lot better for your mood, than what you'll find in the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Don't make the holidays white&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second way to boost your mood with your diet, Jacka says, is increase your consumption of whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of grabbing a croissant or sugary cereal for breakfast, have a bowl of overnight oats or a savory congee (made with brown rice). Toss corn or barley into your salads. Eat corn tortillas instead of flour ones. Swap out biscuits and dinner rolls for 100% whole wheat breads or pastas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When you're baking pies, cookies, and cakes, you can substitute the white flour in the recipe for whole grain flours, such oat, barley, or whole wheat. Same goes with pizza: have the kids create a 100% whole wheat pizza from scratch this holiday. Or make whole wheat bread in a bread machine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Beef up on beans &amp;amp; lentils&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's another major way to eat this mood-boosting fiber, says&lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/meroe_morse.html" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Meroë Morse &lt;/a&gt;at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center: Eat beans and lentils. "Your microbiome loves beans," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In our research, we see that a very small amount of beans in your diet can actually greatly impact your microbiome in a good way," Morse says. Unlike many leafy greens or many vegetables, you don't have to eat many beans to get a hefty dose of fiber. For example, a quarter cup of cooked black beans contains about five to seven grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dried beans and lentils are also a super inexpensive way to boost fiber,&lt;a href="https://fshn.illinois.edu/directory/hholsche" target="_blank"&gt; says Hannah Holscher&lt;/a&gt;, who's a microbiome scientist and dietitian at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. "Now that we're getting into soup season, just pick your favorite soup, pick your favorite bean and add them into the soup."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dried lentils cook up quickly because they don't need soaking. "We frequently eat lentils in our house," she says. "You can saute some onions with tomatoes and olive oil. Then add lentils with different Indian spices," she says. "It's delicious." Or make a big pot of Thanksgiving chili with both beans and lentils.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Take it slowly&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, beans, lentils, and dense whole grains are powerful foods for your gut, Holsher says. Start off with a small serving and titrate up slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With beans, some individuals will get a bit of gas and bloating if they eat too many or they're not used to eating them. "Try a few different varieties," Holscher recommends. "Or soak the beans beforehand. That can help to reduce any types of unwanted side effects."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You can also find high amounts of fermentable fiber in chia seeds, berries, apples, pears, avocados and unripe bananas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After your microbiome adjusts, the bacteria will thank you by raising up your mood long-term. After all,&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6469458/" target="_blank"&gt; studies suggest &lt;/a&gt;that when your gut bacteria are happy — they make you happy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The parents of a three-year-old boy born with a devastating, life-limiting genetic condition say they are now excited for his future after he received a revolutionary stem cell gene therapy treatment developed by researchers at the University of Manchester.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In February this year, Oliver (Ollie) Chu, was treated for Hunter syndrome in a clinical study being delivered at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital (RMCH) in collaboration with the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine at Saint Mary’s Hospital – both part of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) The trial is managed and sponsored by the University of Manchester.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Children with Hunter syndrome, a rare, inherited condition also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), have an error in a gene, meaning they cannot produce an important enzyme that breaks down complex sugar molecules. Over time these sugars build up in organs and tissues, leading to joint stiffness, hearing loss, breathing and heart problems, developmental delays and cognitive decline, resembling childhood dementia. Hunter syndrome can be life-threatening, with life expectancy typically between 10 and 20 years. Currently the only licensed drug that can help to improve life for children with Hunter syndrome is Elaprase – a weekly enzyme replacement therapy that takes approximately three hours, that children must take for their whole life. Approximately 50 patients in the UK receive Elaprase, which costs around £375,000 a year per patient. The drug can reduce mobility and organ problems but cannot improve mental decline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, several months on from the procedure, Ollie has fully recovered from the transplant, and his parents and the Manchester researchers are excited by his progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The clinical study at RMCH is investigating a one-off gene therapy which involves removing the child’s stem cells, replacing the faulty gene and re-injecting the modified cells into the patient. These stem cells can produce high levels of the missing enzyme and also reach the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Rob Wynn, Consultant Paediatric Haematologist and Director of Paediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Programme at RMCH and joint clinical lead, said:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;““For many years we have performed bone marrow transplant for children with Hunter Syndrome and similar illnesses. However, these are difficult procedures that can only deliver as much enzyme as the donor’s blood naturally has.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Gene therapy is not only safer and more effective, but it enables us to use the child’s own cells which cuts out the need to find a donor, and means we can produce more enzyme for the patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The principles of using gene therapy of blood cells to treat patients with this disease can be applied to many other conditions which offers exciting prospects for patients and healthcare professionals. Our medicine is becoming safer, and better, and that can only be a good thing!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Simon Jones Consultant in Paediatric Inherited Metabolic Disease at the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine at Saint Mary’s Hospital,  joint study lead, said: “Since having the gene therapy Ollie is no longer having weekly Elaprase infusions, but instead of seeing levels of the previously missing enzyme dropping we are seeing very high levels in his blood, and this is an extremely encouraging sign that the treatment is working.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Jones, who is also a Medical Director of the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Manchester Clinical Research Facility (CRF) at RMCH, added: “I have worked in researching treatments for children with rare genetic diseases for over twenty years and I have sadly seen many children lose their lives to these devastating conditions. This is a truly exciting development&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;which could lead the way for treating similar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;genetic conditions and bring hope to other families.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ollie Chu is the first of five young children with Hunter syndrome to participate in this study. The research is jointly funded by the University of Manchester and by LifeArc, a self-funded, not-for-profit medical research organisation, and developed by researchers at MFT and The University of Manchester, working in partnership with the University of Edinburgh and Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), where patients’ cells are taken to be modified with the missing gene in their specialist laboratories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While some people may need more to feel satisfied and strong or to maximize their muscle gains in the gym, the reality for many Americans might be that they meet their protein requirements through their daily diet. For some, that requirement may be well below &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/what-100-grams-of-protein-looks-like-measured-out-on-your-plate/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;100 grams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which is one elusive &lt;a data-id="33b24e30-af11-43ca-8493-670076990400" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10772463/" target="_self"&gt;protein goal&lt;/a&gt; often touted, including by the wellness team here at CNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are absolutely obsessed with protein," Freeman said, pointing to the fact that it's also likely you'll hit your "protein goals" even if you're eating a plant-based diet, as long as it's varied and full. One potentially influencing factor toward the protein goal trend is the rise in interest in the carnivore diet, which prioritizes meat consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What most people forget is some of earth's biggest and strongest mammals, they're all plant-based," Freeman said. "When was the last time you saw a protein-deficient gorilla or elephant?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans, in particular, have a complicated and sometimes disordered relationship with food -- when we're not obsessing over getting enough of something (#proteingoals), we're restricting something else (think the villainization of fats and carbs). Examples of some diets that oscillate between these extremes include the ketogenic diet, the carnivore diet, calorie-counting apps and taking extra time to make &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/ozempic-oatzempic-and-finding-the-grain-of-truth-in-the-latest-weight-loss-hack/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;complicated drinks in the name of weight loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be more defensible if we were reaping the health benefits of sticking to these diets, but instead, &lt;a data-id="37639753-0909-43d9-9f94-5c4ba9cba940" href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html" target="_self"&gt;Americans are leaders in chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/heart-disease-awareness-when-why-screened-now/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and diabetes (preventable and often reversible through diet). Many people also suffer a reduced quality of life from restricting themselves or following diets that may or may not meaningfully improve their health down the line, or may also inspire shame or eating disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, most of us are &lt;em&gt;actually deficient&lt;/em&gt; in fiber, and a good chunk of us are low in other very important nutrients, such as iron and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/not-getting-enough-sun-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

This is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. (There are about 2.2 pounds in one kg.) This means that a person who weighs 200 pounds needs approximately 73 grams of protein to meet their needs and avoid deficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where it gets tricky is deciphering exactly how much protein you need not only to stay alive but to thrive. Like every health "thing," what's best for you will depend on your body and your activity level, for example. But even taking this into account, you may not have to work as hard as you think to get adequate protein, even if you're hitting the gym regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2023 &lt;a data-id="e0070466-7e71-4860-9dfd-5a756609fc7e" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwf_9wqWY0" target="_self"&gt;podcast hosted by Zoe&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition science company and maker of at-home gut microbiome test kits, Stanford University professor and nutrition researcher Christopher Gardner explained why fears of falling short in the protein department are often overblown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the US comes up with recommended daily allowances for protein, vitamins and minerals, the standard approach is to take two standard deviations above the average," Gardner explained in the podcast. For the 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of weight, he said, "You've picked a number that should be adequate for 97.5% of the population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if you're above average? Chances are, you're not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me, it's the American idea of 'that's what the RDA is, but I know I'm above average, so let me make sure I get some extra here,'" Gardner explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was built in to recognize that some people need more [protein]," he continued, going on to explain that when you're working out heavily, you're naturally going to feel hungrier, which will prompt you to eat more -- which means (for most people), naturally eating more protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to really gain muscle? To its credit, and in a refreshing turn of American-diet events, the protein goal trend&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; focused on adding rather than restricting. And if you're into intense &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/how-to-melt-fat-by-lifting-weights-strength-training-workout-tips/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;weight lifting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or want to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/growing-muscles-faster/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;gain muscle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, you will need more. But chances are that "more" is not as much more as you might think -- at least if you're considering consciously adding protein through shakes and other supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to build muscle or are seriously into weight lifting, estimates on how much "extra" protein you need vary, and the best (and safest) advice is always to talk to your doctor or nutritionist to take your whole health and lifestyle into account. However, some estimates range from 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of weight. Others are &lt;a data-id="db2bd2b4-084f-478f-83b6-64e9e23a0438" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-much-protein-per-day-build-muscle#How-much-protein-is-too-much" target="_self"&gt;even higher&lt;/a&gt;, at up to 2 grams per kilogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discussion assumes you enjoy counting your macros, though.

Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are known for being rich in potassium. But if your kidneys aren’t functioning well or if you’re taking medications like spironolactone or ARNI, potassium can accumulate to dangerously high levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.

Spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach is another potassium-heavy food, and it can also affect the stability of warfarin, a commonly prescribed blood thinner. It’s healthy, Dr Dmitry notes, but what matters is consistency, not eating “as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Soy sauce&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with sodium, soy sauce can cause significant fluid retention. “Just one sushi night can leave you two pounds heavier and short of breath the next day,” he warns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Liquorice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real black liquorice can raise &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-pressure" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and lower potassium levels. It often sneaks into teas, supplements, and flavoured products without people realising it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol acts as a direct toxin to the heart. For many patients, Dr Dmitry says, it can be one of the underlying reasons their heart function deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concludes by reminding people that food isn’t simply ‘good’ or ‘bad’, it interacts with your medications, lab values, and overall heart function. His advice: Know your body. Know your numbers. And stay ahead of your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

But when you’re raising a child who has serious anger issues, it’s an even greater challenge. Throw some entitlement, narcissism, and teenage hormones into the mix, and you have a powder keg waiting for you at home. And sometimes, you can’t help but laugh at the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/strange-family-habits-thought-normal/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;absurdity&lt;/a&gt; of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One parent &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ei9igg/aita_for_laughing_uncontrollably_at_my_son_when/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the AITA online community whether they were a jerk for uncontrollably laughing at their son, who, in a fit of gamer rage, destroyed his Christmas present. Not only that, but the teenager had the audacity to ask for a replacement gift.

rel="nofollow"&gt;Objective_Original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In order to have a healthier relationship with your emotions, you first need to understand the core reasons behind your anger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your child’s anger issues get to the point where even minor mistakes or social interactions make them lose their cool, you might need the help of a mental health expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A therapist with a background in either anger management or teenage development might be able to help them reframe their experiences and give them the tools to calm down when they get frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, your teenager will need parental support at home while they learn to handle their incredibly intense emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, anger management therapy &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/12195-anger-management" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;teaches&lt;/a&gt; you coping skills. What’s more, during your sessions, you delve into what’s actually making you angry at your core. Your therapist might ask you the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes you angry?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are you really angry about?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the intensity of your anger appropriate for the situation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is your anger masking another emotion? For example, fear, anxiety, hurt, or shame?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does anger feel in your body?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some anger management coping skills include things like cognitive restructuring (changing the way you think about situations) so that you don’t dwell on or exaggerate negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, thinking that a specific situation is the ‘worst thing’ that has ever happened to you is unhealthy. A healthier, more nuanced perspective would be to acknowledge that the situation might be bad, that it’s okay to be upset, but that things aren’t catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teen sitting in gaming chair with hands on head, frustrated after breaking new chair one day after getting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="son-asked-replace-christmas-gift-broke-anger-dad-laughs-03" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/son-asked-replace-christmas-gift-broke-anger-dad-laughs/?image_id=son-asked-replace-christmas-gift-broke-anger-dad-laughs-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Parent Wonders How Bad They Messed Up After Hysterically Laughing At Son’s Entitlement" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/son-asked-replace-christmas-gift-broke-anger-dad-laughs/?media_id=son-asked-replace-christmas-gift-broke-anger-dad-laughs-03" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/son-asked-replace-christmas-gift-broke-anger-dad-laughs-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9700351" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/son-asked-replace-christmas-gift-broke-anger-dad-laughs-03.jpg" alt="Teen sitting in gaming chair with hands on head, frustrated after breaking new chair one day after getting it." title="Teen sitting in gaming chair with hands on head, frustrated after breaking new chair one day after getting it." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a class="author-name whitespace-nowrap text-neutral-content visited:text-neutral-content-weak focus-visible:-outline-offset-1 a cursor-pointer no-visited no-underline hover:no-underline staff-link" href="https://elements.envato.com/gamer-devastated-by-losing-NTHCGMV" aria-label="Author: Objective_Original" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" rel="nofollow"&gt;seventyfourimages (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There are lots of different skills that you can learn so that you can express your emotions in a mature way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important coping mechanism is developing your communication skills so that you’re better equipped to express your anger.

When you lash out at others, you alienate them while also taking a toll on your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anger often harms loved ones the most and can take a toll on your relationships with them. It can make it difficult for others to be comfortable around you, erode their trust and respect, and be especially damaging to children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s your perspective, dear Pandas? Do you think the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/good-wholesome-parents/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;parent&lt;/a&gt; was in the wrong to laugh at their son’s entitlement, or do you think their reaction was justified?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you have &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/people-share-parenting-hacks-reverse-psychology/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;handled&lt;/a&gt; things if your child destroyed their Xmas gift in a fit of rage?

&lt;p&gt;There’s something incredibly funny about watching a dog decide he’s done following the rules. And then immediately attempt to outsmart the entire household. Puppy logic moves fast; one moment they’re chewing a sock, and the next they’re solving engineering problems like it’s just part of their afternoon. That’s the energy Golden Retriever puppy Rusty brings in this throwback video from @rusty.and.ollie. In it, he stands in front of a baby gate with the determination of someone who believes his humans have underestimated him. Even at four months old, he has that spark that makes you think, Oh no, he’s about to figure this out, and then root for him anyway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-puppy-goes-viral-for-hide-and-seek-skills"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy goes viral for hide-and-seek skills&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video has already garnered over 6.2k likes, and once you watch it, you’ll even find yourself reaching for the like button. Rusty starts by nibbling the lock of the baby gate like it’s a puzzle explicitly designed to challenge him. He’s tall enough now to balance his front paws on the bars. And this gives him prime access to the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before getting serious, he casually spits out a piece of toy fluff. It is a tiny moment that feels like him saying, Hang on, I need my mouth free for this operation. All of this plays out over the Mission Impossible theme, which could not be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rusty studies the lock, shifts his weight, then uses a mix of tongue, teeth, and puppy stubbornness to find the lever. When he finally hooks it just right, the gate pops open. He grabs it with a paw, pulls it toward himself, and walks through like it’s the most obvious outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The comments loved him for it; people called him a “mastermind,” a “little escape artist,” and warned his humans to prepare for bigger stunts. His owner even added a disclaimer explaining the toy fluff moment, which somehow makes the whole thing even more endearing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rusty wasn’t just escaping. He was troubleshooting, adjusting, and then successfully walking out of frame like the “Great Houdini” himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They serve as an important energy reserve for the body. Inside each adipocyte, fat is packed into lipid droplets that can be tapped when fuel is needed -- for example, during the hours between meals. To release this stored energy, the body relies on a protein called HSL, which functions much like a switch. When energy is running low, hormones such as adrenaline activate HSL, prompting it to free fat that can then supply various organs.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without HSL, it would be reasonable to expect fat to build up, as though the body had lost access to its energy supply. Surprisingly, this is not what happens. Research involving both mice and patients with mutations in the HSL gene shows that the lack of this protein does not lead to excess fat or obesity. Instead, affected individuals experience a loss of fat mass, a condition known as lipodystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although obesity and lipodystrophy appear to be complete opposites, both involve fat cells that do not function properly. As a result, each condition can contribute to metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HSL Found in an Unexpected Location Inside Fat Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this surprising behavior, a team led by Dominique Langin, professor at the University of Toulouse within the I2MC, took a closer look at where HSL is found inside adipocytes. The protein is well known for its role at the surface of lipid droplets, where it helps break down stored fat. However, the study revealed that HSL also resides inside the nucleus of fat cells. "In the nucleus of adipocytes, HSL is able to associate with many other proteins and take part in a program that maintains an optimal amount of adipose tissue and keeps adipocytes 'healthy'," explains Jérémy Dufau, co-author of the study, who completed his doctoral thesis on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that nuclear HSL levels are tightly controlled. Adrenaline, which activates the form of HSL located on lipid droplets, also encourages the protein to leave the nucleus. This process occurs naturally during fasting. In contrast, obese mice show elevated levels of HSL within the nucleus, suggesting a shift in this regulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Revised Understanding of HSL's Role in Metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HSL has been known since the 1960s as a fat-mobilizing enzyme. But we now know that it also plays an essential role in the nucleus of adipocytes, where it helps maintain healthy adipose tissue," says Dominique Langin. This additional responsibility helps explain why the absence of HSL results in lipodystrophy, and it offers new insights into metabolic disorders such as obesity and related health complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery appears at a critical time. In France, one in two adults is overweight or obese, and globally the number reaches two and a half billion people. Obesity increases the risk of a range of diseases, including diabetes and heart problems, and often reduces overall quality of life. Continued scientific research is crucial to improving prevention efforts and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-custom-everlit-iframe-embed"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangor is the epicenter of Maine’s largest ever HIV outbreak. But the ripple effects from the cluster &lt;a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/10/12/bangor/bangor-health/penobscot-county-hiv-cluster-still-active-joam40zk0w/"&gt;first identified&lt;/a&gt; in Penobscot County in October 2023 are being felt across the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health care providers are confident that the outbreak will lead to new cases outside the Bangor area, and some local governments and community organizations are taking proactive steps to get ahead of that spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their efforts reflect an awareness that the outbreak will likely reach beyond Penobscot County and affect the entire state. They also come at a critical time when threats to public health infrastructure at the federal level could jeopardize efforts to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Public health providers in the southern Maine area kind of circled up and we’ve been having conversations around how to prepare for a similar outbreak,” said Katie Rutherford, the executive director of Portland’s Frannie Peabody Center. The organization is dedicated to providing support to people with HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Multiple people involved with municipal and nonprofit public health organizations outside of Penobscot County told the Bangor Daily News that these preparations are a necessary step in the face of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would be more surprised if we didn’t see any cases,” said Bridget Rauscher, Portland’s public health director. “We don’t know for sure the extent of this outbreak, which I think is kind of important to remember. We only know what we’ve tested, right?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rutherford and Rauscher’s organizations have both been ramping up HIV testing efforts in southern Maine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, Portland’s health department &lt;a href="https://www.portlandmaine.gov/1482/News?contentId=ffad011a-65b2-42e5-80db-ebf3b72cfc24"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was adding a walk-in testing day to its STD clinic, citing the HIV outbreak in Penobscot County.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Maine’s largest city is also encouraging more frequent testing, offering more testing certification trainings, and partnering with homelessness and recovery organizations to administer tests in the community, according to Rauscher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We generally will encourage people to test for HIV and hepatitis C every three to six months. We’ve moved that up to every one to three months,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Penobscot County outbreak is largely affecting people who are homeless or use drugs. Rauscher said her department is particularly focused on testing residents who share those risk factors or who said they’ve recently come to Portland from Bangor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIV self-test kits have also been crucial for organizations with limited staff, and deploying staff out into the community has helped reach more people with testing.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“They’re very user-friendly self-test kits and it’s just an oral swab. It’s nothing painful or really even uncomfortable in the way that the nasal swabs were with COVID,” Rutherford said. Her organization distributes more than 1,500 tests every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some smaller cities are starting efforts to ramp up testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials in Augusta are looking into ways the city could provide HIV self-test kits, according to Steve Leach, Augusta’s deputy fire chief and health officer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The city itself doesn’t have a big footprint involved in [HIV prevention] right now,” he said, but conversations with people in Penobscot County who are working to mitigate the outbreak prompted him to consider new solutions.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Emergency medical services teams already bring naloxone, the overdose reversal drug often known by the brand name Narcan, when responding to substance use calls, Leach said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s looking into whether the city could also distribute HIV tests this way, which would require approval from the state, or if it would be possible to distribute them through other agencies in the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the HIV prevention work in Augusta is done by MaineGeneral, the nonprofit health care system headquartered there. The health system works with harm reduction programs, Maine Family Planning and social service organizations to provide testing, safe sex supplies, clean syringes and connections to treatment, according to Shane Gallagher, MaineGeneral’s director of HIV and harm reduction services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, the health system announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.mainegeneral.org/about-us/news/2025/hivaids-services-expand/"&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; its federally funded HIV/AIDS medical services to cover nearly all of Maine’s counties. It also operates a &lt;a href="https://www.mainegeneral.org/about-us/community-health/harm-reduction/"&gt;syringe service program&lt;/a&gt; in Augusta and Waterville.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The organization has been working to increase testing and provide more home test kits, Gallagher reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the state, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is coordinating with organizations like MaineGeneral to replicate what’s being done in the Bangor area to other cities and towns, according to Anne Sites, Maine CDC’s director of infectious disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One thing we’ve seen in Penobscot County is a really successful initiative to enhance our reach around PrEP,” she said, referring to the medication that reduces the risk of contracting HIV. She noted ongoing conversations with Maine Family Planning about using mobile services to provide PrEP in the Lewiston-Auburn area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine CDC is also encouraging clinical providers across the state to focus on the syndemic of HIV, STDs, hepatitis and substance use disorder — a concept that refers to the way co-occurring epidemics can exacerbate each other — and test simultaneously for HIV and other diseases, Sites said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Most of the HIV cases identified as part of the Penobscot County outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/10/30/bangor/bangor-health/30th-hiv-case-detected-penobscot-county/"&gt;appeared alongside&lt;/a&gt; cases of hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health organizations have also stressed that syringe services, a type of harm reduction that involves providing people who use drugs with clean needles, are a key part of HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Syringe service programs are proven to reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission rates by around 50%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-syringe-services/php/about/"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Their organizers often provide other services, including testing for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, syringe service providers in Maine conducted 526 HIV tests onsite, according to a &lt;a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/doc/11834"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. That number is up from 373 in &lt;a href="https://mainedrugdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2023-ssp-annual-report.pdf"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt; and 96 in &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/sites/maine.gov.dhhs.mecdc/files/2022%20SSP%20Annual%20Report.pdf"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent report also detailed 4,498 referrals by Maine syringe service providers to outside organizations for testing and care for viral hepatitis, STDs and HIV.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But while Portland’s syringe exchange has been operating for more than 25 years, syringe service programs face resistance in some of Maine’s smaller cities because of concerns about needle waste or &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2024/11/syringe-services-for-people-who-inject-drugs-are-enormously-effective-but-remain-underused"&gt;misconceptions&lt;/a&gt; that they will encourage drug use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is often politicized. But it’s an effective public health strategy,” Rauscher said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple municipalities in Maine are currently working to limit syringe exchange services. Auburn instituted a &lt;a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2025/08/19/auburn-council-votes-for-moratorium-on-needle-exchange-programs/"&gt;six-month moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on needle exchange programs in August, while Sanford is considering banning needle distribution altogether, according to an &lt;a href="https://d3n9y02raazwpg.cloudfront.net/sanfordmaine/2148330e-b0bf-11ef-ab4b-005056a89546-a37320f4-242e-40ed-b0e1-9c45dbcd8fda-1761919093.pdf"&gt;October report&lt;/a&gt; by City Manager Steven Buck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the city of Auburn did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Lewiston &lt;a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2025/10/22/after-months-of-debate-lewiston-council-passes-needle-ordinance/"&gt;passed an ordinance&lt;/a&gt; last month limiting the city to just one syringe service provider. In response to a question about whether the city of Lewiston is monitoring the outbreak and preparing for it to spread, city spokesperson Angelynne Amores wrote, “Maine CDC measures that — it is not measured locally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any local efforts to combat HIV spread could be overshadowed by proposals at the federal level to eliminate funding for such services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The House appropriations bill for next year proposed cutting $1.7 billion in funding for HIV programs, including completely eliminating HIV prevention programs and reducing care and treatment funding by 20 percent, according to the &lt;a href="https://hivhep.org/press-releases/house-republicans-go-way-beyond-presidents-budget-by-ending-all-hiv-prevention-slash-aids-care-by-20/"&gt;HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed budget was “very bad timing for Maine,” Matt Wellington, the associate director of the Maine Public Health Association, said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in Maine have also struggled to get support from the U.S. CDC amid the Penobscot County outbreak. In October, the federal agency paused a request to send field epidemiologists to help manage the outbreak, partly because of the government shutdown, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/07/metro/cdc-maine-bangor-opioid-needle-shutdown-kennedy-penobscot/"&gt;the Boston Globe reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In a small state like Maine where it’s not normal for us to have HIV outbreaks of this size, we’re just not equipped to handle it by ourselves,” Wellington said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and others in Maine’s public health sphere agreed that resources and funding are essential for supporting the people who have been diagnosed with HIV and for preventing new spikes in cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People can live healthy lives with HIV,” Rutherford said, “but I think people also need to understand that if these robust programs were to go away and people don’t have access to their medications, then it might as well be 1981 again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bangor Daily News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQSTFsX3ZzM01KTEEzRlFna2wtS2gweTYwcFlQVmJXYkwzRk56YmRCRE9HYnk1Znc4bkM5ZGkyVWRJZklWRHR5R3FoYVdzZV80UG9hbHRKWG84ZkxjT1VBXzk4ZWV6MmJqWGVCRlp5OUVVS3ZQUWRDWjE1VEVNY1BZeWhzS1I3ejRXWGlTaTJHQUNIdlVPOWpQTGN2QllfZFRZ</guid></item></channel></rss>
