She told patients 'we see you'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years, thousands of Americans who suffered debilitating side effects after getting the Covid vaccine were told there &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9430083/Coronavirus-health-chiefs-row-bold-claim-vaccinated-people-not-carry-virus.html"&gt;was no evidence the shot was linked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some were branded antivaxxers, others told their symptoms were imagined or related to other conditions, like long Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14414367/covid-vaccines-new-syndrome-biological-changes-yale.html"&gt;that changed this week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Wednesday, a team from Yale University known for their rigorous work revealed the mRNA shots can cause a previously unknown condition known as 'post-vaccination syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The syndrome appears to cause brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus, extreme fatigue and biological changes to patients' immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, told DailyMail.com she understands her findings could be seen as controversial. But she wants patients to know her team will keep studying to bring them 'better transparency and safer vaccines.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki told this website: 'For patients who are suffering from post-vaccination syndrome, we want them to know that we see you, we listen, and we will keep on doing more research in this area so that this condition can be recognized, and better medical care can be provided.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She believes her work will 'absolutely' be a paradigm shifting moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine. He is pictured with his two children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told DailyMail.com that she 'can't really trust the public health institutions anymore' after her Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People with PVS have felt dismissed and ignored because PVS is not a medically recognized condition,' Dr Iwasaki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I believe that rigorous scientific research will lead to better diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PVS. Such research will also lead to better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki and her team emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' and that it is unclear exactly how common PVS is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Iwasaki, who is the director of the Center for Infection &amp;amp; Immunity at the Yale School of Medicine, said the team planned to address this question by launching larger studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We would like to expand our research to a larger cohort and validate our current findings,' she said. 'We need funding to carry out such future work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10161467/Veterans-not-vaccinated-said-worried-effects-newness-shots.html"&gt;recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html"&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the new research, DailyMail.com spoke with dozens of Americans who report being injured from the vaccines and have expressed hope that their symptoms are being validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of them was Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother from Montana who decided to get the Pfizer Covid vaccine in February 2021 out of a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, what she thought was a good deed turned into a years-long ordeal with dangerous blood conditions that could have caused deadly bleeding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two told DailyMail.com: 'I thought that I was doing the right thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that while she's not anti-vaccine and has 'had all the vaccines that I can,' she does feel the government abandoned her after mandating the shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had a problem before. I've had all the vaccines that I can. My kids are vaccinated. I believe in vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just two days after her vaccine, she noticed red spots all over her hands and an uncontrollable nose bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed Mrs Ponce de Leon with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Platelets are essential for blood to clot and for wounds to heal, so having too few could lead to uncontrolled, deadly bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After months of infusions to get her platelets back to normal, Mrs Ponce de Leon was rushed to the University of Washington in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors replaced all of her plasma with donor plasma where doctors performed plasmapheresis, a procedure that removes all of the plasma from blood and replaces it with donor plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler is pictured before his injury with his wife and their two children. He said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, was a military veteran, triathlete, and skateboarding competitor before she was left wheelchair bound after her Covid shot. She is pictured at left before the injury and at right after&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ponce de Leon has fully recovered, but doctors were unable to offer an explanation for her conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One doctor wrote in a letter that her condition was likely caused by the vaccine 'because he couldn't find any other reason.' &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Yale study, participants with PVS had reactivated Epstein-Barr, a contagious virus that can cause flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes and nerve issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has also been shown to attack the blood and marrow, which may have explained Mrs Ponce de Leon's sudden blood disorders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told DailyMail.com that while she supports vaccines, she is cautious about supporting treatments heavily touted by government authorities.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: &lt;/span&gt;'It's just very frustrating with this one because I did what I thought I was supposed to do. I thought I was doing the right thing, and then the government just hangs you out to dry. It's like gaslighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's demoralizing. It makes me sad that I can't really trust the public health institutions anymore.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki's research is part of Yale's LISTEN Study, an ongoing trial on post-vaccine injuries and long Covid, a mysterious condition blighting an estimated 17million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition manifests differently in each person, but it includes an array of symptoms from fatigue to brain fog to shortness of breath.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cause of long Covid is poorly &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12640371/cause-long-Covid-virus-remnants-gut-good-hormone.html"&gt;understood, but one of the team's theories is that the Covid virus could be 'hiding' in internal organs like the gut.&lt;/a&gt; This would make the virus undetectable in standard nasal swabs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Iwasaki's lab is also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14359817/experts-covid-pandemic-concerning-new-virus.html"&gt;preparing for the possibility of future pandemics&lt;/a&gt; by studying bat coronaviruses that resemble Covid-19 to study how they replicate, as well as immunotherapy for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The virus can be transmitted via droppings, urine, blood and saliva. The rats also provide a vessel for the virus to move between farms and houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what agency initially identified and tested the rats — or why the rats were tested. A spokeswoman for Riverside County’s public health department said she was unable to provide a response to those questions, and directed them to the USDA. The USDA did not respond to questions Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first rats identified as having the disease in the United States since 2021, when this latest version of the H5N1 virus made its debut in North America. Other mammal species that have since been infected include skunks, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-01-18/cat-deaths-bird-flu-prompts-pet-food-new-rules"&gt;domestic cats&lt;/a&gt;, bottlenose dolphins, harbor seals, foxes, mountain lions and coyotes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 species of North American mammals have been infected, including &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-13/cdc-study-h5n1-bird-flu-in-dairy-cows-more-widespread-than-thought"&gt;tens of thousands of dairy cows&lt;/a&gt; — with cases confirmed in at least 973 herds across 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, disclosed Wednesday, comes at a time when the Trump administration is trying to rehire dozens of USDA bird flu scientists it had recently fired, based on cost-cutting recommendations from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the USDA did not respond to inquiries from The Times about the rats or the fired employees, the agency said in a statement &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-flu-in-rats/" target="_blank"&gt;to CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that it was working “to swiftly rectify the situation,” and said it had exempted veterinarians and other emergency response personnel focused on bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency “continues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza,” it told the news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:54:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNSDRyc1BtZjFfOGJUQnZaZkNzbkp3WXktZVVUWU44QWYxMnVUblUzUV9fQ3VsTG5Kb0Rrbm1pZy0td3FUT1BVMHk3OVI5S3NLbHc3NW1JU0QwV0kxdEpBYzFwTTNCOTMzOWEtWTNIVW1lWFVacUxaX1FobmRLWUY4dVE3a1hMempFSUw4MTVJMTdzZw</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu discovered at poultry market in Union County - NorthJersey.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQS3VPUTNmTHRrQWZ1V2Z6V0pXdGdJb3RTQ3BhVEJTOE4wRzB0OGNyMlNvTmpkcVV2YVNVUUlCblh6U0ZVUTAxZHF2U1lmSXVqYk0ySkl3NWlMS0lNVmhwUHBzV0F3Q0V2b1BSTmlQRG9FRkFmNXVPS2kxMzVQdFloZzFtU1Zna0ctbzIybkNYazFkX3pyTkdpbU4yMDZTYzJoMl9PQUVHRC1OT2E3YWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em__fp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/health/2025/02/19/dead-birds-found-in-monmouth-and-ocean-counties/79186976007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg79186976007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="79186976007"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="23"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" aria-label="The state DEP was contacted over bird flu fears after dead waterfowl were found along the Shark River."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;No humans have been reported infected with the virus in NJ.

&lt;p&gt;Other affected counties in Texas include Dawson (6 cases); Ector (1); Lubbock (1); Lynn (1); Terry (20); and Yoakum (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, the majority of the cases continue to be in children: 26 are in infants and young children ages 0 to 4, and 51 are between ages 5 and 17. All but five cases have been in unvaccinated people. Sixteen people (roughly 18 percent) have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, there have been no hospitalizations, and five of the nine cases are in adults. The other four cases were between the ages of 5 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given low vaccination rate in the area and the contagiousness of measles, health officials expect the outbreak to continue to grow. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses known; 90 percent of people who are unvaccinated and exposed will fall ill. The disease is marked by high fevers and a telltale rash and can cause severe complications in some, including younger children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, about 20 percent of people with measles are typically hospitalized. Five percent develop pneumonia, and up to 3 in 1,000 die of the infection. In rare cases, measles can cause a fatal disease of the central nervous system later in life called Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Measles also wipes out immune responses to other infections (a phenomenon known as immune amnesia), making people vulnerable to various illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

            Stressful situations can’t be avoided in daily life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00043b5vddfxq43c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You’re standing up to speak in front of a crowd. You’re getting ready to meet someone for a first date. Or worst-case scenario, you’re facing an emergency. Your hands start to shake, your heart races, and your mind floods with negative thoughts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00053b5vsrcl7e01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those are all-too-familiar scenarios for Sarah Lorenzini, a rapid response nurse of 10 years and founder of the &lt;a href="https://www.rapidresponseandrescue.com/community" target="_blank"&gt;Rapid Response Academy&lt;/a&gt;, a program that educates nurses on how to train for and handle any emergency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00063b5v1xkjtxjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I remember being a new nurse in the ER, and even though I had all of the head knowledge of what to do in emergencies, when that patient rolled in from EMS … I found myself having a hard time catching my breath,” said Lorenzini, who is also the host of the nursing education podcast &lt;a href="https://www.rapidresponseandrescue.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rapid Response RN&lt;/a&gt;. “And if you can’t get your body to work, to do the things that you know how to do, then you can’t help the patient.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00073b5vcmowo9no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s common for the body’s natural “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;fight-or-flight&lt;/a&gt;” response to kick in, and it may be hard to react the way you would otherwise like to under pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00083b5vevnvqmia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you can train the mind and body so that when the next high-stress situation arises, you are better prepared. Here’s how to keep your cool no matter what happens, according to Lorenzini and other experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t00093b5vvaimrare@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Lorenzini was 9 years old, she went snorkeling with her family in Florida. At the time, she didn’t have the upper body strength to hoist herself up from the water, so she would need help getting back on the boat any time she left.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000a3b5vr0m6df7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when she encountered a barracuda in the water, she became so scared that the adrenaline her body produced gave her the strength to swim faster than she ever had and jump in the boat on her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000b3b5vp2gxxjwk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lorenzini noted that if she hadn’t known how to swim well or hadn’t practiced attempting to get back in the boat on her own, she would not have been as prepared for her quick escape from the predatory fish. “I would have just still floundered in the water, not knowing what to do,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000c3b5vu97kuthq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her experience shows how being prepared ahead of time can help in high-stress situations, such as completing a nursing program, practicing a speech in front of a mirror or studying for a big test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000d3b5voeknib1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there are also ways to build up what’s called your nervous system resilience, the ability to keep the body’s stress response in a healthy balance, ahead of such stressful situations, said Dr. Inna Khazan, a lecturer on psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a clinical psychologist specializing in health psychology and performance excellence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000e3b5vq7i81a8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One technique she often advises is to exercise the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt;, or HRV, which is the way in which a person’s heart rate goes up and down and constantly varies. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;Having a higher HRV&lt;/a&gt; is a sign that your nervous system is healthy and that your heart can adapt better to daily challenges and stressors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000f3b5vdjym6tzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By working on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8924557/" target="_blank"&gt;resonance frequency breathing&lt;/a&gt;, a slow diaphragmatic breathing that is usually three to seven breaths per minute and synchronizes with your heart rate, the HRV will increase, which will train the heart to recover from stressors more quickly, Khazan said. People with higher HRVs tend to find it is easier to make decisions, focus and respond in challenging situations, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000g3b5vqzqztv0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By checking in throughout the day concerning smaller stressors, a person can be more in tune with the way their body responds under high stress, said Julie Uhernik, a licensed professional counselor and registered nurse in Parker, Colorado.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000h3b5v0nmcxudm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping a physical or mental note of how much stress you feel on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day can help you identify not only your stressors but also the natural symptoms of stress that occur, she added, and doing so can help you better react in those high-stress situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000i3b5vdt3prn1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Basic needs such as eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep at night are crucial as well for improving your response to high stressors, Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000j3b5vtm438hzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a person starts to feel the sensations of stress, thoughts such as “I can’t do this” or panic begin to happen, Lorenzini said. But when you’re mindful that these reactions, such as a change in breath or heartbeat, are normal, then you can use that awareness to your advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000k3b5ve0ml4uay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call it super nurse, or super Sarah, where I can function at my best,” she added. “With time, I kind of retrained myself to say, ‘Oh, these things that I’m feeling in my body, these are not hindering me. These are actually making me a better clinician, a better nurse.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000l3b5vg4v7so0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reminding yourself to take slower breaths is also important, Khazan said. She recommends breathing in normally through the nose for four seconds and breathing out — as if you are gently blowing out a candle — for six seconds to help rebalance the system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000m3b5vft6m5cxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The goal is not to relax but rather “a self-regulation practice, so it can help the body get to that optimal level of activation,” Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000n3b5vluka7xgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using your senses, such as taking note of the feeling of your feet on the ground or looking around to assess the situation and the reactions of others, can help you pause and think before reacting, said Uhernik, who is also a disaster mental health responder for the American Red Cross and a consultant in emergency preparedness for mental health professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000o3b5vhpbbhu8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, it is important to remember that stress is inevitable, especially when emergencies happen, Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000p3b5v3lqhbw5y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A little bit of stress is good for us. It keeps our nervous systems primed to respond when we need to, and to go back to a state of calm when things are OK and there’s no threat in the environment,” Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The five-year average for this week in the flu season is under 500 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="2"&gt;“We’re still in the midst of flu season, and unfortunately this latest news reminds us that flu can be serious and people should not take the possibility of getting the flu lightly,” said Dan Suffoletto, public information manager for Public Health-Dayton and Montgomery County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="4"&gt;In Montgomery County, there have been a total of 620 flu hospitalizations, accounting for 6.8% of all the flu hospitalizations in the state. This is also a rate of 5.27 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="5"&gt;In Butler County, there have been 193 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 2.1% of all flu hospitalizations in the state, according to ODH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="7"&gt;In Clark County, there have been 168 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 1.8% of all flu hospitalizations. Greene County has seen 153 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both is-deferred"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;Flu activity usually peaks between December and February. In Ohio, flu activity has been increasing since early December and has increased more rapidly since the beginning of the year. Current activity is very high, ODH says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="10"&gt;Since the start of the season, more than 9,000 flu-related hospitalizations have been reported in Ohio, according to ODH. Influenza A is the predominant type of the flu being seen in the state, and it &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/flu-a-vs-flu-b" target="_blank"&gt;causes more severe illness &lt;/a&gt;than type B flu, the Cleveland Clinic says. Flu A accounted for 96% of flu cases reported in late 2024, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;The current number of flu-related hospitalizations is well above the five-year average for this time in the season, ODH says. The state’s five-year average omits years from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="12"&gt;There were 9,134 total flu-related hospitalizations by the end of the 2022-2023 flu season, according to ODH, which is in mid-May. The end of the 2023-2024 season had 10,236 hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;Ohio generally reports between one and six influenza-associated pediatric deaths each season.

This newly identified mechanism is independent of external stimuli and could influence vision by alternating between detail enhancement and object detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments involving over 200 participants confirmed the effect across various conditions, including different breathing rates, lighting, and visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests the brainstem may control this process, as the function remains intact in individuals without an olfactory bulb. Since pupil size impacts visual clarity, this discovery may help explain how breathing influences attention and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil-Breathing Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil size is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathing may naturally switch vision between detail focus and object detection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform new diagnostic tools for neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered a fundamental mechanism that affects the size of the pupil, namely our breathing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;, shows that the pupil is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation – something that could affect our vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107906"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the aperture in a camera, the pupil controls how much light reaches the eye. It is therefore fundamental to our vision and how we perceive our surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three mechanisms that can change the size of the pupil have been known for over a century: the amount of light, focus distance and cognitive factors such as emotion or mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now scientists have discovered a fourth: breathing. The pupil is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is unique in that it is cyclical, ever-present and requires no external stimulus,” explains Artin Arshamian, associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since breathing affects brain activity and cognitive functions, the discovery may contribute to a better understanding of how our vision and attention are regulated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted five experiments with over 200 participants, examining how breathing affects pupil size under different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the effect persisted whether participants breathed quickly or slowly, through their nose or mouth, if lighting conditions or fixation distance varied, if they were resting or performing visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in pupil size between inhalation and exhalation was large enough to theoretically affect vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the function is intact in people born without the olfactory bulb, a brain structure that is activated by nasal breathing. This suggests that the mechanism is controlled by the brainstem, a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now investigating whether changes in pupil size during breathing also affect vision. Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimising for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” says Martin Schaefer, a postdoctoral researcher at the same department at Karolinska Institutet and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may also be clinical applications, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One potential application is new methods to diagnose or treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, where damage to pupil function is an early sign of the disease,” says Artin Arshamian. “This is something we want to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council and the European Research Council (ERC).

However, evidence for a coupling between respiration and pupil size remains scarce and inconclusive, hindered by small sample sizes and limited controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of pupil size in visual perception and as a reflection of brain state, understanding its relationship with respiration is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In five experiments using a pre-registered protocol, we systematically investigated how respiratory phase affects pupil size across different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;50), we examined nasal and oral breathing at rest under dim lighting with nearby fixation points, then replicated these results under identical conditions in Experiment 2 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;53).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 3 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;112) extended this to active visual tasks, while Experiment 4 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 57) extended this to controlled breathing at different paces under ambient lighting with distant fixation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Experiment 5 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 34), individuals with isolated congenital anosmia (born without olfactory bulbs) were used as a lesion-type model during visual–auditory tasks to assess whether the respiratory–pupil link depends on olfactory bulb-driven oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all conditions – free and controlled breathing; different tasks, lighting and fixation distances; and with and without olfactory bulbs – we consistently found that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We term this effect the pupillary respiratory-phase response, the fourth known mechanism influencing pupil size, alongside the pupillary light, near fixation and psychosensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:24:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Dak9uWlRLbGFwSzdCdVZESVRZaHRXNXAydi1Oc243RHQtT2E3ajlOcWJnY0pqOHRVOGRKOWJtV0ViNDlCM05RNGxDWWsxNDAtaS0zVm5QcmFTck00SmlZR1lweFd4ZVNRY0pHcDY4MUc</guid></item><item><title>Data suggest Paxlovid doesn't reduce severe COVID in older, vaccinated adults - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRklJeTNxNVNhZ3dqM1piNHl2VGx2Z0hmcnFXOEdxM0xkS2VnRHFCU2RPSFRacE5tTzdFMnExNm5iRXRid29hVjZEcGF4REM5LXdPVzFaOEY3cGVpNFpLNU5mcWg5QWVDZnFjRE4tbXo2VkRXRE9aLWpxcEpDQnlLWlcxaEVxdUdrRWw2cVVaa3VwRVdGY3VlcFhEaWVWYUtMT0NGSXBxNnljTmE5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study yesterday in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; suggests Paxlovid, the oral antiviral approved for use against severe COVID-19 symptoms, did little to lessen the risk of hospitalizations and death among older, vaccinated adults in Canada.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer’s initial clinical trials on the drug were conducted on unvaccinated adults, the authors said, with median ages of 42 to 46 years. Older adults are more likely than younger adults to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and are at the greatest risk of severe complications from the virus.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2830683"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;looked at all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations in adults in Ontario, Canada. Between April 1 and November 30, 2022, Ontario implemented an age-restrictive policy on access to Paxlovid, with only those 70 and older able to get the drug.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the strongest predictor of severe COVID-19 is advanced age, it has been crucial to obtain evidence on whether the results of the Pfizer trials generalized to older and vaccinated populations,” said John Mafi, MD the study’s lead author in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074346"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Univeristy of California Los Angeles.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared outcomes among adults just under 70 years who were not prescribed Paxlovid to those who were given the antiviral. The authors identified 1,620,884 Ontarians aged 65 to 74 years during the study period; most (87.5%) received at least 2 COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paxlovid's effect 4 times weaker than in clinical trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors found the prescription rate of Paxlovid more than doubled after the age-based policy was put in place, increasing by 118% at age 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the increased use of Paxlovid did not result in fewer hospitalizations or deaths for those treated with the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences just below compared with just above age 70 years (per 10,000 patients per month) in COVID-19-related hospitalizations (39.5 vs 42.9) or all-cause mortality (109.6 vs 115.7).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said the study showed Paxlovid’s effect on COVID-19 hospitalization among vaccinated older adults is four times weaker than the effect originally reported in Pfizer’s 2022 clinical trial, reducing hospitalizations by 1.3 percentage points. The original clinical trial showed an absolute risk reduction of 5.5 percentage points against hospitalizations.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the study found no significant effect on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated older adults, our findings underscore the urgent need for further randomized-clinical trials investigating Paxlovid’s effects in higher-risk populations, such as older subgroups who are frail or immunosuppressed,” Katherine Kahn, MD, another study author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2469643?src=exp-la"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging Microbes &amp;amp; Infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, researchers at the Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) describe their discovery of a mutated H5N1 avian flu strain resistant to the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) on eight chicken farms in British Columbia in October 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When investigating a widespread and ongoing H5N1 outbreak at 45 poultry farms, the CFIA National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease team sequenced the virus, identifying it as a clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) strain. The virus had a neuraminidase surface protein derived from a low-pathogenic flu virus from a North American lineage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Isolates from 8 farms reveal a mutation in the neuraminidase protein (H275Y) that is exceptionally rare among clade 2.3.4.4b viruses (present in 0.045% of publicly available clade 2.3.4.4b isolates)," the researchers wrote. "NA-H275Y is a well-known marker of resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus likely emerged in Canada in September 2024, the authors said. The US Department of Agriculture later updated its North American A(H5N1) genotyping tool GenoFlu to designate the virus as genotype D1.1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection," the researchers wrote. "As oseltamivir is the most widely used therapeutic and prophylactic against IAV [influenza A virus], the continued circulation of viruses harboring NA-H275Y may necessitate a re-evaluation of influenza treatment strategies in Canada."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's unclear whether the mutated virus is still circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four more H5N1 detections in US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed four more highly pathogenic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;avian flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; detections, including a commercial turkey farm in Sac County, Iowa, affecting nearly 30,000 birds and three backyard flocks in Maine and Pennsylvania totaling nearly 500 birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the last 30 days, 101 commercial and 55 backyard flocks have been infected, at a loss of 21.7 million birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Indefinite changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stat asked the HHS specifically about the Wild to Mild campaign as well as promotional campaigns for other vaccines, but an HHS spokesperson puzzlingly responded with a statement saying: "No, the CDC was not told to take down the flu vaccination campaign webpage," which wasn't what the outlet had asked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement went on to say: "Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump’s agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive." NPR received the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile on Thursday, The Washington Post reported that the HHS told the CDC to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/"&gt;indefinitely postpone a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee&lt;/a&gt; (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP), which Kennedy has criticized. ACIP, comprised of independent experts, meets regularly to review and discuss vaccine safety and efficacy data and vote on recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP was previously &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/Xvof3"&gt;scheduled to meet February 26 to 28&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf"&gt;discuss a large number of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including those against meningitis, influenza, RSV, chikungunya, HPV, mpox, pneumococcal infections, Lyme disease, COVID-19, and CMV. An HHS spokesperson told the Post that the meeting was "postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting," but there is no rescheduled date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading medical experts and organizations, such as the American Medical Association, quickly sent &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting"&gt;a joint letter urging Kennedy to preserve the meeting&lt;/a&gt;. "Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance," the letter states. 'Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats. ... Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, also on Thursday, Politico reported that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223"&gt;Kennedy is preparing to remove ACIP members&lt;/a&gt;. And, the AP noted earlier that during a speech to HHS employees on Tuesday, Kennedy vowed to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;investigate the CDC's childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, despite assuring senators prior to his confirmation that he would not make changes to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/10/flu-cases-increase-influenza-cdc/"&gt;this flu season&lt;/a&gt;, cases have led to school closures and strained hospital systems all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BANAI63FWZDS7BUJYPIZSNWPGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Vaccines are the best defense against many infections, health-care experts said, and they encouraged people to stay &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/25/covid-flu-winter-virus/"&gt;up to date on their shots&lt;/a&gt; for themselves and their children.

A week later, deadly outbreaks with a slower disease course occurred at two high-biosecurity chicken farms, where dead birds were found mainly near the barns' air-intake vents; the entire population was culled. All farms had their own wells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts hypothesize that the slower disease course in the chicken barns may be due to lower H5N1 transmissibility in chickens, waning concentrations of the virus over distance from the duck farm, or housing conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers, from the State Veterinary Institute Prague, used genetic, epizootiologic, meteorologic, and geographic data to reconstruct events suggesting that wind was the mechanism of H5N1 transmission between poultry on at least two of the farms. Three H5N1 strains collected from birds at all three farms were genetically identical, no large waterways were near the chicken farms, and the duck farm didn't share staff or contractors with the chicken farms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, meteorologic data revealed a breeze in the direction of the chicken farms, cloudy conditions that could have kept the sun's ultraviolet light from killing the virus, and virus-supporting cool air. The team didn't conduct air sampling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation," the study authors wrote. "They also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Airborne not only or major mode of spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead study author Alexander Nagy, PhD, told CIDRAP News that he and his team became convinced about the role of windborne transmission in these outbreaks when they confirmed the identical identity of the H5N1 strain in the donor and recipient farms, the nearly ideal weather conditions during the transmission event, and the slow disease progression in the chicken barns characterized by feed and water consumption before clinical signs appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Additionally, the affected birds [dead chickens] were located in sections closest to the air inlets," he said. "Finally, we excluded all other plausible explanations."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), publisher of CIDRAP News, said airborne transmission can be very important, "meaning that that's the most logical explanation for when you have many barns with outbreaks in one geographic area where human biosecurity cannot be implicated as a reason for transmission."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, he said, the poultry industry has been reluctant to acknowledge airborne transmission because of the implications it may have for its practices: "The industry's reluctance to accept this possibility is not that dissimilar to what we saw with the lack of some in the medical and public health communities to recognize that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was also airborne."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the researchers did a very good job of laying out their hypothesis and supporting data, their conclusion should be interpreted with caution, said David Swayne, DVM, PhD, a poultry veterinarian who retired as an avian flu researcher with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture Research Service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think we, as veterinarians who deal with avian influenza and other infectious diseases, would acknowledge that there is some airborne—and I'll use the word dissemination—and that may lead to transmission," he said. "But we have to be cautious to make sure people understand that it doesn't mean that it's the only way, nor that it's the major way. And each individual facility is going to be different."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montserrat Torremorell, DVM, PhD, chair of the Department of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, called the researchers' argument for airborne transmission "compelling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Meteorological conditions, timing of infection, housing conditions of the animals, susceptibility of the animal populations that became infected and the lack of other epidemiological links between the premises are supportive of airborne transmission in this case," she said in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an avian flu outbreak in Minnesota, Torremorell collected air samples inside and outside facilities housing three infected turkey and three egg-laying chicken flocks. Air samples from five of six flocks tested positive for large quantities of H5N1 virus, all of them in the active infection stage. The negative sample was from a flock in the advanced stage of depopulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The larger number of positive samples were inside the facility and at the exhaust fan (~5 m [meters; 16 feet] away from the facility), and the number of positives decreased with distance, but even with that we identified some suspects (traces of RNA material) at about 150 m and 1 km [kilometer; roughly a half mile)," she said. "Viable virus (through virus isolation) was found inside the facilities, at the outside of the exhaust fan and at about 100 m."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entry mechanism difficult to determine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Stallknecht, PhD, professor emeritus at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine and a wildlife expert, said the study provides additional circumstantial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692305/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to several &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031114"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggesting windborne viral spread. But he added that the mechanism of disease transmission into a poultry house is hardly ever identified, because there is no way to control for variables. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It basically says that it could have happened, and I would not dispute that," he said. "But to actually come down with concrete proof like you would in an experimental controlled experiment, there's too much going on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Influenza can be transmitted by a million different ways, probably many of them we don't even know about," he added. For example, whether the virus entered the poultry house via a raccoon, bird, person, or a person's shoes, "those kind of details never really get resolved."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stallknecht said he and his team tried to research water-based avian flu transmission associated with ducks. "And we got to the point where we just had to quit because the numbers and the probabilities were so extreme," he said. "You can't do an experiment to pick up a one-in-a-trillion event."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Swayne said that moving equipment and people in and out of poultry barns has to be done at a very high level of biosecurity to prevent viral transmission: "Yes, you could have movement of the virus by the wind, but it may be that it's tracked in to the barns by the contamination around the outside, either from wild birds depositing fecal material there as they eat, spilled feed off of grain silos, etc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added that just because a virus is transported via the wind doesn't necessarily mean it will enter a barn that way. "The virus can move on particles or water droplets by the wind for a distance, and then it could land and contaminate the environment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Authors were initially skeptical, too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nagy acknowledged that airborne spread isn't typically considered a primary route of infection in poultry, and windborne spread requires "a constellation of many specific conditions" that behooves further research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"However, when all conditions align, windborne transmission becomes a feasible mode of spread and could play a more significant role than previously thought, especially in densely populated poultry areas," he said. "The windborne route is important to consider in cases when the infection emerges in new locations without obvious links to other farms or when illness and mortality are first observed near the air inlets."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poultry operations typically consist of confined, mechanically ventilated buildings with high population densities, a situation unlikely to change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

James Messerschmidt&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 66 confirmed cases of the avian flu in cats across the country, where most of the instances were linked to the animals eating infected foods and prompting officials to ring alarm bells for the “susceptible” feline population as the virus continues to rip through avian flocks across the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the city warned against allowing cats to roam outdoors “where they may hunt wild birds or other animals” and from ingesting raw food that could have been tainted by infected birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian flu cases in the Big Apple have been rapidly spreading in 2025, with nearly 2,000 birds across five flocks found to be affected compared to 4,870 birds across all of the previous two years, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen ducks and wild birds at the Queens and Bronx zoos have been killed by the suspected virus so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A red-tailed hawk in the Bronx, a great horned owl in Queens and a swan in Brooklyn have also fallen victim to the deadly flu, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/wild-birds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in cases led Gov.

They go after the birds. That’s what they do,” Massaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;More than a dozen ducks and wild birds at the Queens and Bronx zoos are believed to have been recently killed by the virus. Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 500,000 stray cats wandering throughout the five boroughs, Massaro theorized the flu might have already breached the feline population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cats become infected, they show signs of respiratory illness such as sneezing and difficulty breathing, as well as severe depression and even seizures, &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet known if cats can spread the disease to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cats have an increased risk if they are in contact with poultry or dairy cows on farms or in backyard flocks, are exposed to sick or deceased wild birds, particularly waterfowl such as geese and ducks, consume unpasteurized dairy products or raw or undercooked poultry, including raw diets, or are in contact with people or other animals known to be infected with H5N1,” Dr. Stephanie Janeczko, vice president of shelter medicine services at the ASPCA, told The Post, adding that the overall risk to cats at the moment is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recommend that all cats exposed to H5N1 or those suspected of being infected with the virus should be evaluated by a veterinarian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Gov.

This protein is critical for motor neurons to make proteins and grow the "wires" that send signals out to the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the SMN1 gene is mutated, the body cannot make enough SMN protein, and the nerves cannot adequately send out signals to muscles. As a result, the muscles — especially in the thighs, back, shoulders and hips — begin to weaken and shrink from disuse and a lack of nerve stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of these symptoms differs depending on the type of SMA a person has.

Earlier onset symptoms — which show up before or shortly after birth — typically lead to worse survival outcomes. Infants with SMA type 1, which manifests within six months after birth, develop severe weakness that causes difficulty breathing and swallowing, and they often die within the first few years of life without treatment or breathing support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMA type 1 is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558933/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558933/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;leading genetic cause of infant death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant involved in the recent case was found to be at risk for SMA type 1 after undergoing genetic testing in the womb.

A tablet taken by mouth, it causes the body to boost the activity of a second gene, called SMN2, which also carries the instructions for building SMN protein but typically makes less than SMN1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, this drug had only been administered after birth, but in this case, the drug was given to the fetus in the womb upon request from the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had already experienced a loss from this horrible disease," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stjude.org/directory/f/richard-finkel.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.stjude.org/directory/f/richard-finkel.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Richard Finkel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical neuroscientist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, told Nature News. Risdiplam is approved for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-oral-treatment-spinal-muscular-atrophy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-oral-treatment-spinal-muscular-atrophy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;children who are at least 2 months old&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so the FDA gave special clearance for the drug's early use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 32 weeks of pregnancy, the mother started taking risdiplam daily for six weeks. Testing at the time of birth indicated that the drug had indeed been entering the baby's system while in the womb. Roughly one week after birth, the baby herself was given the drug orally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At birth, the infant was found to have higher levels of SMN protein and less nerve damage than other babies born with SMA type 1. In the months since her birth has shown no signs of abnormal muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's obviously very reassuring," Finkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child will likely have to take risdiplam for the rest of her life, into adulthood, and she will be closely monitored for any changes in her muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that this result is based on only a single case, but despite this, these findings indicate that SMA and other genetic conditions might be more effectively tackled if treatment is started before birth. They hope to investigate if these results can be replicated in larger studies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh-5rbT5ZL20WlBYblMA91l1uQRrEHs6iYt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh-5rbT5ZL20WlBYblMA91l1uQRrEHs6iYt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This means modest weight reduction, reduced stress, a healthier diet, and more physical activity “can all work to restore normal function of the body’s organs and tissues,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How weight loss can reverse diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Weight loss&lt;b class="cXscX "&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is the most effective way to induce diabetes remission because "insulin resistance is closely linked to high levels of visceral fat," says O.

Although we don't understand exactly how it occurs, Duru says, "we know that visceral fat communicates with the organs that absorb glucose from the blood, causing these organs to develop the insulin resistance that leads to type 2 diabetes." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-is-bmi-inaccurate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i class=" "&gt;We’ve been measuring BMI since the 70s—but is the flawed metric still helpful?)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is further evident as &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791310" target="_blank"&gt;longitudinal research&lt;/a&gt; shows that a high body mass index (BMI) significantly increases one's risk for type 2 diabetes.

New research suggests overuse of products like whey powder or creatine may be affecting young people’s mental health as well as their their physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Canadian study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;, finds that young people who consume multiple muscle-building products are more likely to show symptoms of a condition called muscle dysphoria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About 2,730 Canadian teens and adults ages 16–30, mostly white males and females, were recruited via Instagram and Snapchat advertisements. They were asked about their use of six different common workout products — amino acids, creatine monohydrate, pre-workout drinks or powders, protein bars, weight or mass gainers, and whey protein shakes or powders. Protein bars were the most commonly consumed, followed by whey protein shakes or powders and creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study also asked about body image, asking for responses to statements such as, “I feel like I have too much body fat” or “I feel depressed when I miss one or more workout days.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whether they used supplements or not, 26% of the boys and men scored above the level for muscle dysmorphia — that is, being extremely preoccupied with a perceived lack of muscle mass or tone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Use of the workout supplements and products was associated with more symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, what the researchers called greater “drive for size” (the desire to have bigger muscles) and “functional impairment” (the inability to work or maintain a social life). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On the positive side, young people who used supplements were generally satisfied with how their bodies were responding to them, the study showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Boys and young men can be susceptible to fixating on their muscles, which can lead to obsessive thoughts and exercising to build muscle — weightlifting for many hours a day, for example — to the point it interferes with daily life, &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/profiles/kyle-t-ganson/" target="_blank"&gt;Kyle Ganson&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and assistant professor of clinical social work at the University of Toronto, said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not known how many people in general are affected by this kind of body dissatisfaction, but it’s thought to be “quite rampant in the gym space,” Ganson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ganson said the findings reflect data and trends seen in the U.S. as well. About&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335522000857?via%3Dihub#ab010" target="_blank"&gt; 55% adolescents and young men in the U.S. &lt;/a&gt;use bodybuilding supplements, according to some estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association and lobbying group that represents businesses that manufacture supplements, said in a statement released after the study: "The most obvious explanation is that people who are dissatisfied with their appearance take steps to change it. That might mean adjusting their diet, exercising more, or taking supplements to support their goals. In fact, the study itself found that supplement users were actually more satisfied with their progress than non-users." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts said the findings spotlight how unrealistic body ideals — often fueled by &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=muscle%20growth%20supplement&amp;amp;t=1739811742505" target="_blank"&gt;fitness influencers&lt;/a&gt; who promote or sell workout supplements online — may be driving more children and young adults to overuse powders or pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It doesn’t help that many fitness influencers use filters that deceive others into thinking their appearance is real or naturally attainable, said &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/jesse-mills" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jesse Mills&lt;/a&gt;, a urologist and men’s health specialist with UCLA Health, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a global trend towards anime-like figures and cartoonish proportions,” Mills said. “I really think body dysmorphia in general is the new pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a study Ganson published last year, nearly half of respondents said &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211266924000215" target="_blank"&gt;online influencers who promoted workout supplements &lt;/a&gt;were a “primary” motivation for their own use of the products. The hashtag &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/creatine" target="_blank"&gt;#creatine&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has over 382,000 posts, many of which are flagged with “creator earns commission” warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The pressure to meet muscular body standards may motivate young men and boys to use supplements more often, to the point where “it’s like second nature,” Ganson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Interestingly, among girls and women, supplement use was also associated with stronger desires for bigger, more toned muscles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study’s findings underscore the dangerous reality that “companies are profiting off the mental health distress of young people,” said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/eating-disorders-striped/team/bryn-austin/" target="_blank"&gt;S. Bryn Austin&lt;/a&gt;, a social epidemiologist and behavioral scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. “We have a public health problem here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, these companies don’t have to prove their products’ safety before hitting the market, Bryn added. Some bodybuilding supplements have been found to be contaminated with &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/caution-bodybuilding-products-can-be-risky" target="_blank"&gt;prescription drugs, anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt; and toxic heavy metals like lead and cadmium, according to a &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/wp-content/uploads/CleanLabelProject_ProteinStudyWhitepaper_010625.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recent report by the Clean Label Project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Evidence is mixed whether the supplements do all they claim, like enhance athletic performance and improve muscle stamina. But when used appropriately, many of the ingredients in muscle-building supplements such as whey protein are safe. Some, like creatine, have been&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211266924000215" target="_blank"&gt; shown to boost muscle mass &lt;/a&gt;and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Using supplements isn’t “inherently problematic,” Ganson said. Once started, though, “it’s kind of like a Pandora’s box,” especially for boys and young men who often turn to social media for advice. “That’s why you should be careful when taking these supplements; they can only support your goals in so many ways.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mills, the men's health specialist, cautioned that, for some young men, supplement powders may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Imagine you’re an impressionable 18- to 25-year-old who’s working out but not seeing the gains that other guys have,” said Mills, who emphasized that genetics can make it harder for some people to grow muscle. “That is certainly a gateway to, ‘what else is out there?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Bryn’s team conducted a study published last year in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827804" target="_blank"&gt;journal JAMA Network &lt;/a&gt;Open that followed 4,000 boys and young men ages 10–27 over 14 years. The group found that people who used muscle-building supplements were eight times more likely to start anabolic steroids compared to those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Steroids are “an incredibly effective way to put on lots of mass in a very little bit of time,” Mills said. Because even low doses are associated with side effects, this dangerous mental and physical cycle has become a “public health concern.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:14:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNZHFtcEhIVmppUjM4YWw0N0FaNTRwcEp5ZmJpVEJBQVZnRE5kbnJuNHpwd0dPRlVNdDhNZF8zRjZNV1BDRXZFSkRXdVZNeWJUOXhUMUFXLXlOa0NqVUo4NnhRTUtwdTN5MEtjNWNzMlJXbTdhYk1fdlJvamdkYnQzV2tjVnBSenlGZUk1cV9hRHJnYUcxSXlpaTExazhQR215bnBCbDlxc0F0d1EyNm55MEI1dFZuRDFjbmfSAVZBVV95cUxNT05yNy1wcWxGcnpFYnVpeFFyd3lJcjA4LWFMRFozVUxoS1l1SzY0Ni1uRU5Bc0FRSGM3OGVpSHZxMm5JM2ZjcDFXVjVibHMtNFU1TXY1UQ</guid></item><item><title>Your Dentist May Be Able to Detect Alzheimer's - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNbHVoaW5oeDZvR3huMHRidHNmX25NRGZPTWQ2anR3dVRnUnJuUXVlTlJkNkFfNEE2clZySy02eU1FMFQ1WmowQTBMb3RObG0tUlFPVk1ENzBUa25OaVpnZUEtekNsSVNYQlRJVHhJNk5wZzRFVUloZGpDUDlQZkd4OUF0N2NUVHFKblJlaF9mQ2dJVmVo0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBOUHNGMzNQbDdySkR3VkRPa2ZEbXU0ckZDVFJuZmxJZTR6TVZESGk1TEtpenZ2bU9yS3ByZnpxTnB5bWFHSnZwcVZjRVRDc202a05uc3ZkX21NR09hZzRubzZvN2NYZHVZOEdrX09jWkp0X1NxWEM3aDFKMmpjTFVpcGNKQmhpTmpXLWtSTVV1aHM5TTJfX1NjeHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/1/pgae543/7960038"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt; found that our mouth microbiome can help identify early signs of cognitive decline. The researchers determined that specific kinds of oral bacteria are associated with cognitive impairment, specifically memory decline and Alzheimer’s disease.  By analyzing the oral microbiome, dentists can potentially offer a unique and non-invasive method for assessing the risk of developing this debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed the oral microbiome of 110 people over the age of 50 in the U.K., according to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63833506/mouth-bacteria-alzheimers-risk-study/"&gt;Women's Health&lt;/a&gt;.  One group had no decline in brain function while the second group had mild cognitive impairment. The group with good memory function had large amounts of the bacteria Neisseria and Haemophilus in their mouths. The second group had higher levels of the bacteria Porphyromonas, common in periodontal disease, and were more likely to suffer memory problems. The researchers noted that the bacteria Prevotella, which is also commonly found in periodontal disease, is also associated with individuals who have the APOE4 gene, which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists theorize that bacteria in the mouth can trigger inflammation, which then travels to the brain, causing dementia. Another possibility is that when the bacteria is imbalanced, it can impact the formation of nitric acid from the nitrate found in the diet from sources such as vegetables. Nitric acid helps boost memory and communication in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say it’s too soon to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between oral microbiome and Alzheimer’s, but other researchers believe it’s possible. A study conducted by a team from the &lt;a href="https://www.dental.columbia.edu/news/cdm-researcher-finds-link-between-oral-health-and-dementia"&gt;Columbia College of Dental Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found a “clear link between poor periodontal health and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Bramen, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, suggests that eating nitrate-rich foods like vegetables can “benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top researcher Panos N. Papapanou, a professor of dental medicine, who was one of the scientists who found the link between periodontal health and Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers, warns that periodontitis is highly prevalent among elderly Americans, and especially among those who have limited access to oral healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are data that demonstrate that people who take care of their oral health have lower general health care expenditures,” he says. “Taking care of your mouth is important for your oral health and function, but also an integral part of general wellbeing as people age.”&lt;/p&gt;

and has over 25 years of clinical research under her belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Bowring often takes to her TikTok to share her advice on longevity and staying healthy, and this time was no different, as she offered viewers four new pointers to keeping your body in tip-top shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tip number one is to get out in the sun without sunblock on, without your sunglasses,' Dr. Bowring shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is so important to get natural sunlight exposure on as much of your body as possible to help prevent disease,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/benefits-sunlight#benefits"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, getting outside and being in the sun is good for you, as it can boost your mood and Vitamin D levels, which is beneficial for bone health, immune function, and even muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, per the&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aad.org/media/stats-sunscreen#:~:text=Dermatologists%20recommend%20using%20sunscreen%20on,not%20just%20during%20the%20summer."&gt; American Academy of Dermatology Association&lt;/a&gt;, it is important to wear sunscreen on the areas of your body that aren't covered by clothing when you go outside, as it can help to prevent sun damage and skin cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next on Dr. Bowring's list was to get exposed to the cold, even if it may be uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Janine Bowring, a naturopath who is based in Canada and has over 25 years of clinical research under her belt, has revealed four daily hacks that can help you prevent disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'It is so important to get natural sunlight exposure on as much of your body as possible to help to prevent disease,' she said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cold exposure, your cold showers, will help with your mitochondrial health,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It helps to give you more energy, and [it's] really important for longevity,' Dr. Bowring added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/6-cold-shower-benefits-consider"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, cold showers can have a lot of benefits, like improving your circulation and reducing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Bowring also advised people to limit their exposure to electromagnetic fields or electromotive force, also known as EMF, which emit from your phone while its in use, per &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet"&gt;National Cancer Institute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recommended making sure your phone and Wi-Fi routers stay at a distance from you, especially when you're sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You gotta shut these things down so that you're preventing that mitochondrial DNA damage,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in November 2018 in the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250044/#:~:text=Numerous%20studies%20revealed%20the%20detrimental,main%20cause%20of%20EMF%20damage."&gt;National Library of Medicine &lt;/a&gt;'revealed the detrimental effects of EMFs from mobile phones, laptops, and other electric devices on sperm quality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dr. Bowring told viewers that they should make sure that they are eating foods that are fresh and growing in the season and area where you live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She also recommended taking cold showers because they 'help with your mitochondrial health' (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/blog/2022/picked-at-their-peak-the-benefits-of-buying-seasonal-produce/"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, eating produce that is in season and 'picked at its peak' can be beneficial to your health, as the food will be packed with more nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is really important because sunlight imprints like a barcode on our food, based on that energy from the sun and we can better metabolize our foods if we're eating in the right season,' Dr. Bowring shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the comments section of her video, many thanked her for the tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Love these tips, so simple yet not so obvious,' one person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another agreed, 'Great list.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:01:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQOVVHVUExb2Uwdy1sNnR4cUJEZUxSZlo3LUNkMjYwdVlLMVF1aDJOY0lpdzB3NWVqME42TUltQnlpYkxESllHWDNMTnMxakVCUWZNQ3dfbVNOUEdQeXZIM3NkUXVTSHMyTndKVmlrMnFtZENzZVc0T2xiOF9OaUx5emdBcHlrTXV0X1o0WC1CNjBKakdYUEVHMXF6bkxoQdIBowFBVV95cUxOR2hSTFhKckVyYjQxRlF5YUJ4OFQzR1JqcW1VWGxFbWJHSUxndUlaMGhEbVRYVzk5empPOWEyLXlKamVTdmN0V2hXeXQtLUUwNWNTNm1LdDFRNXg1SkFLYzYyS2xqWkdZRHhldWlRM3J3azRIZjJYLUVNbVJPQ3lTZFV2V2U1YU9tNC1taWxQeXdGV3BqMWFlS2MxekNtOEZhWjcw</guid></item><item><title>Eating grapes every day can transform your body in a unique way - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQXlGUWlFRENMNmk3YjNOR1hWWnNhQjV3TEhDVXd0X2RuTG9KT1p3QUx3RkpFYUd3dk9BdEhlYVJWSmc3V3RGUkNaZkh3V1BqaXhfN0RfVHdZSGRTLTlXSVVaVEQ4VTFpRHRjeFpVemgyRXczclpJN1N0clZEVzROYk5scm4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle health plays a vital role in overall well-being, affecting strength, mobility, and longevity. While exercise and protein intake have long been the cornerstones of muscle maintenance, new research suggests that diet alone may have a powerful influence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study from Western New England University (WNE) has introduced an unexpected player in muscle health – grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reveals that consuming grapes daily could alter muscle gene expression, potentially enhancing strength and resilience. These findings offer a new perspective on how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/resveratrol-may-boost-female-fertility-naturally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural foods&lt;/a&gt; impact the body at a genetic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people struggling with age-related muscle loss, the potential benefits of grapes in maintaining muscle function are both exciting and significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exceeding-nutritional-benefits"&gt;Exceeding nutritional benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, people around the world consume approximately 30 million tons of grapes, making them one of the most widely eaten fruits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they are valued for their rich nutritional content, their health benefits extend well beyond basic nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research has shown that grapes positively impact various aspects of health, including cardiovascular function, kidney health, and skin vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, grapes contain compounds that support eye health by protecting against oxidative stress, which can contribute to vision decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their role in gastrointestinal health is also noteworthy, as grapes promote digestion and contribute to a balanced gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their wide-ranging &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/muscles-defy-aging-with-remarkable-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health advantages&lt;/a&gt;, grapes have become more than just a tasty fruit – they are a natural source of essential compounds that support overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grapes-change-muscle-genes"&gt;Grapes change muscle genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, researchers have shed light on the dynamic influence daily grape consumption exerts on muscle gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects are significantly more profound in females, which intriguingly brings male and female muscle characteristics closer to each other at a metabolic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes tied to lean muscle mass showed an upward trend, while those related to muscle degeneration displayed a decline, pointing towards improved muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These revelations open up potential pathways for tackling age-related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-muscles-may-soon-be-able-to-regenerate-like-other-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; loss, a challenge faced by 10-16% of elderly individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Pezzuto, senior investigator of the study, is the Dean of Pharmacy and Health Sciences at &lt;a href="https://wne.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Western New England University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence that grapes have the potential to enhance muscle health at the genetic level,” noted Dr. Pezzuto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given their safety profile and widespread availability, it will be exciting to explore how quickly these changes can be observed in human trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-grapes-affect-muscles"&gt;How do grapes affect muscles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fascinating field of nutrigenomics discusses the influence of diet on gene expression and the corresponding impact of genetic variation on dietary responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined how daily intake of two servings of grapes impacted genetic expression patterns within muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the male and female muscles that usually exhibit significant differences converged into a unified phenotype under the grape-inclusive diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA of a single species, including humans, doesn’t vary notably from one individual to another. However, the primary factor that sets us apart is the expression of DNA, otherwise known as the phenotype. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingestion of grapes brought about changes in the phenotypic gene expression of male and female muscle, predominantly in females, resulting in an aligned metabolic parameter between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another fascinating observation, specific genes linked with favorable muscle health – such as lean muscle mass – were enhanced. At the same time, genes associated with deteriorating muscle health were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to conduct further studies to understand the specific biological processes responsible for these genetic changes in muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also aim to determine how quickly these changes occur after regular grape consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon, scientists can better assess how grapes contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-fuels-neuron-growth-through-muscle-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt; and whether their effects vary among different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrigenomics advances, this study represents a significant step toward developing new dietary strategies for maintaining muscle strength and preventing age-related decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms these findings, incorporating grapes into daily nutrition could become a practical and accessible way to support muscle health across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study opens the door for a deeper exploration of how natural foods can positively influence the body at the genetic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/4/695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:33:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQXlGUWlFRENMNmk3YjNOR1hWWnNhQjV3TEhDVXd0X2RuTG9KT1p3QUx3RkpFYUd3dk9BdEhlYVJWSmc3V3RGUkNaZkh3V1BqaXhfN0RfVHdZSGRTLTlXSVVaVEQ4VTFpRHRjeFpVemgyRXczclpJN1N0clZEVzROYk5scm4</guid></item><item><title>Ohio teen dies from flu, first pediatric death of the year - WTVG</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPYXc5am5RdDZ4RmRFdVVxbGMzX0Y2bm5Wel82SnNQbWxKUE1CS2p0ZTJUUXRCTWhqSmZRcmRJbHQ3bVlzS0VIdDIyenNZY1hUVllCY3BQaS1rLTJtalJvLXRnWG9RZVBBX09odUhzeGd5T0FWMnFZcTF5b0pnU1pCdGVOcVZid9IBmgFBVV95cUxOUTdsQnNtd0dxNU4yMGtLM3dyakthZ2lpcjFkbEdxc2lkeDRSbjRFM0l6UXdyY1FYMzY5ald0ZjFQZi1FbjRUd1RySmk3RTVwNm9tNy15UDV5c3I0eElpa1RyN3hHczh4S2tnQkx2eWRmY1RyR0UzY2pScGlzQ3Nib09rTGZacE9OZENFMEVkbU81MlFGcGlqODF3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio (WTVG) - A teenager from Allen County died from the flu, the Ohio Department of Health reported Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;It’s the first flu-associated pediatric death of the 2024-2025 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Sadly, this tragic death reminds us that influenza, though common, is a serious health threat,” said ODH Director Bruce Vanderhoff, MD, MBA. “We urge parents to protect their kids. It’s not too late for parents and kids to get a flu vaccine. It may very well prevent you or your loved ones from getting seriously ill. And, especially during flu season, it’s important to maintain good hand hygiene and to stay home if you are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Flu activity usually peaks between December and February. In Ohio, flu activity has been increasing since early December and has increased more rapidly since the beginning of the year. Current activity is very high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Since the start of the season, more than 9,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations have been reported in Ohio, which is well above the five-year average for this time in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Ohio generally reports between one and six influenza-associated pediatric deaths each season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Flu vaccines are available at most healthcare providers’ offices, local health departments, and retail pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Other effective ways to avoid getting or spreading the flu include washing hands frequently or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, covering coughs and sneezes with tissues or coughing or sneezing into elbows, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;More information about flu and flu activity in Ohio is available at &lt;a href="https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2f7ictjwgbb.cc.rs6.net%2ftn.jsp%3ff%3d001pO1i2Z94ndg10KuGuLaOIqaB8jnw3cGg9GleFiUh8gpxfHzwtVOTSb0NOyaRyfpmjA_G4OdzUWo3SMu0owTEJjzj-oJ9SS1q96aqjbGRbmJ_1YgWyzV3PIAmjvy4mtRquTXJOIXG0Dy1n0NheSbvJQ%3d%3d%26c%3dIyQ5id0ovYGBbMvXOEtuQh1b1gmLQmhlTMwXAZojthhPBba-3hPymQ%3d%3d%26ch%3d2Saf57bG1wxS5ax94ZOXVk35L7ZCi_b22IYHumZO11xrxe6bGhNS8Q%3d%3d&amp;amp;c=E,1,zQtNkcFMzJ5emjK9bfD23yceskSwfffNeHhQngmbqnEPq7GLOx144dRRLyOCt0jj4G6Gjarp6-AlnF_tZMyWAVnBayhDnQmp86ir8dOqbehU&amp;amp;typo=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.flu.ohio.gov&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/news/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Latest Local News&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/weather/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Alert Weather&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/news/crime/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crime&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/news/national/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;National&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/franchises/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;13abc Originals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WTVG.

&lt;p&gt;Some private schools have shut down because of a rapidly escalating measles outbreak in West Texas. Local health departments are overstretched, pausing other important work as they race to limit the spread of this highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Since the outbreak &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/"&gt;emerged three weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas health department has confirmed 90 cases with 16 hospitalizations, as of Feb. 21. Most of those infected are under age 18. Officials suspect that nine additional measles cases reported in New Mexico, across the border from the epicenter of the Texas outbreak in Gaines, are linked to the Texas outbreak. Ongoing investigations seek to confirm that connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials worry they’re missing cases. Undetected infections bode poorly for communities because doctors and health officials can’t contain transmission if they can’t identify who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the tip of the iceberg,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer for &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/"&gt;The Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, a nonprofit that advocates for vaccine access. “I think this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An unknown number of parents may not be taking sick children to clinics where they could be tested, said Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas. “If your kids are responding to fever reducers and you’re keeping hydrated, some people may keep them at home,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most unvaccinated people will contract measles if they’re exposed to the airborne virus, which can linger for up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/transmission.html"&gt;two hours&lt;/a&gt; indoors. Those infected can spread the disease before they have symptoms. Around &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;1 in 5 people&lt;/a&gt; with measles end up hospitalized, 1 in 10 children develop ear infections that can lead to permanent hearing loss, and about 1 in 1,000 children die from respiratory and neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gaines has a large Mennonite population, which often shuns vaccinations. “We respect everyone’s right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,” said Albert Pilkington, CEO of the Seminole Hospital District, in the heart of the county, in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/at-the-epicenter-of-the-west-texas-measles-outbreak-one-hospital-in-gaines-county-works-towards-containment/"&gt;Texas Standard&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s just what it means to be an American, right?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health officials have been trying to persuade the parents of unvaccinated children to protect their kids by bringing them to pop-up clinics offering measles vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some people who were on the fence, who thought measles wasn’t something their kids would see, are recalculating and coming forward for vaccination,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health departments are also operating mobile testing units outside schools in an attempt to detect infections before they spread. They’re staffing clinics that can provide treatment prophylactically for infants exposed to the virus, who are too young for vaccination. Local health officials are advising day care centers on how to protect young children and babies, and educating school nurses on how to spot signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am putting 75% of my staff on this outbreak,” Wells said. Although Lubbock isn’t at the center of the outbreak, people infected have sought treatment there. “If someone infected was in the [emergency room], we need to identify everyone who was in that ER within two hours of that visit, notify them, and find out if they were vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in rural areas are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7427223/"&gt;notoriously underfunded&lt;/a&gt;. Wells said the workload has meant pressing pause on other programs, such as one providing substance abuse education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zach Holbrooks, executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines, said health officials were following CDC guidelines, as of last year, by advising schools to keep unvaccinated children home for 21 days if they shared a classroom or the cafeteria with someone infected. This means that many parents may need to stay home from work to care for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of private schools have closed down because of a high number of sick children,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The burden of measles outbreaks multiplies as the disease spreads. Curbing a 2018 outbreak in Washington state with 72 cases &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/147/4/e2020027037/180774/Societal-Costs-of-a-Measles-Outbreak?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;cost about $2.3 million&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to $76,000 in medical costs, and an estimated $1 million in economic losses due to illness, quarantines, and caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers expect such outbreaks to become larger and more common because of scores of laws around the U.S. — pending and recently passed — that ultimately lower vaccine rates by allowing parents to exempt their children from vaccine requirements at public schools and some private schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such policies are coupled with misinformation about childhood vaccination now platformed at the highest levels of government. The new director of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has erroneously blamed vaccines for autism, pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0310-248b"&gt;discredited theories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015515"&gt;shown to be untrue&lt;/a&gt; by more than a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X14006367?via%3Dihub"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS postponed an important meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, without saying when it would resume. In addition, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240408191802/https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/toolkit/state-health-departments.html"&gt;letter template to school principals&lt;/a&gt;, advising unvaccinated children to remain home from school for 21 days if they’ve been exposed to the measles virus, is no longer on the agency’s website. An old version remains &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/150924"&gt;posted on its archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a rule, at least 95% of people need to be vaccinated against measles for a community to be well protected. That threshold is high enough to protect infants too young for the vaccine, people who can’t take the vaccine for medical reasons, and anyone who doesn’t mount a strong, lasting immune response to it. Last school year, the number of kindergartners &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm#T1_down"&gt;exempted from a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; requirement was higher than ever reported before, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Gaines, exemptions were far higher than the national average, approaching 20% in 2023-24. Gaines has one of the lowest rates of childhood vaccination in Texas. At a local public school district in the community of Loop, only 46% of kindergarten students have gotten vaccines that protect against measles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid an outbreak that displays the toll of measles in under-vaccinated pockets of America, Texas lawmakers have filed about 25 bills in this year’s legislative session that could limit vaccination further. Lakshaman said the public — the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/"&gt;majority of whom believe in the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of measles vaccination — should contact their representatives about the danger of such decisions. &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/get-involved/"&gt;Her group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.safecommunitiescoalition.org/"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; offer resources to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got children winding up in the hospital, and yet lawmakers who’ve got their blinders on,” she said, referring to pending policies that will erode vaccination rates. “It’s just mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With extensive safety precautions, he hasn't lost any birds to the virus, which has ravaged poultry farms across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But the outbreak forced him to make tough calls, like deciding whether to accept a new batch of baby chicks from a hatchery near a virus hotspot in Pennsylvania. If he didn't, he would have no chickens to replace those that die or get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I had no choice," Kreher told the BBC. "It was either accept those baby chicks, or over the next year, we slowly exit farming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Egg farmers are in the fight of our lives and we are losing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Though the avian flu, or H5N1, has circulated among American poultry flocks for years, an outbreak starting in 2022 has wreaked havoc on farms, killing over 156 million birds and sending egg prices skyrocketing. The virus then got a foothold among dairy cows last year, and this month, a different strain - tied to severe infections in humans - was found in the cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp" alt="Kreher Family Farms An aerial view of a farm in New York " class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Kreher Family Farms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Mr Kreher and other farmers have had to implement a host of safety precautions to ensure their birds are safe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The worsening outbreak comes as President Donald Trump's new administration makes sweeping cuts to government staffing and research funding that public health experts say threatens the country's ability to respond to bird flu and other potential pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This week, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) told the BBC it fired several officials who were working on the response to bird flu before trying to hire them back days later. The administration also promised billions in funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which scientists say could hamper research that helps them understand the evolution of viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Right now, the risk to most Americans remains low, but the virus is continuing to surprise us, and so that could change, and could change quickly," said Michaela Simoneau, a global health security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I worry, as all of these funding cuts are in the political conversation, that we don't cut those programs that have been shown to be most essential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Trump officials said they are working on a new plan to respond to bird flu, one that includes more safety precautions and vaccines while moving away from culling - a process where farmers kill all their birds after one flock becomes infected to prevent the spread of the highly contagious and fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;When asked for details about the new strategy, the White House did not provide specifics to the BBC, but said Joe Biden's administration had "crushed American agriculture with regulatory uncertainty", inflation and "radical environmental policies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;Red flags as a virus mutates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Scientists have seen a number of warning signs in recent months that the avian flu is adapting to infect humans, said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular biology professor at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Influenza viruses don't typically grow well in mammals, so the length of time the virus has circulated in dairy cows is concerning because it allows more opportunities to evolve, Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Bird flu infected cattle for the first time ever in the US at the beginning of last year. Since then, there have been nearly 1,000 confirmed cases across 17 states. There also have been 68 confirmed cases among humans, most of whom worked closely with animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Then, in February, a new variant of the virus - called D1.1 - was detected in dairy cows and an infected worker in Nevada for the first time. The strain also caused two severe infections in humans in North America, a teenager in hospital in British Columbia and a patient in Louisiana who died from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The new variant also means there are now at least two instances in which cows have caught the virus from wild birds, and not other dairy herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We're seeing these little red flags, real signs that the virus is making some inroads," Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The virus has upended poultry and dairy farms where workers have had to kill millions of birds to prevent more infections. It's a battle US consumers have felt at the grocery store and a recurring theme during the presidential campaign - in January, the average cost of eggs in the US rose more than 15% from a year ago, to $4.95 a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Mr Kreher said that despite a host of security measures, including washing vehicles on farms, wearing steel-toed boots and using lasers to deter wild birds, the outbreak continues to worsen across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Bird flu "is on our minds from the moment we get up to the moment we sleep, if sleep comes", he said. "We need new strategies to fight this virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;A new Trump strategy for farmers in crisis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;California poultry farmer Christian Alexandre has seen firsthand the financial and emotional devastation of a bird flu outbreak. In 2022, he had to kill all 45,000 of his chickens when the virus spread at his family farm near the Oregon border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It was extremely painful," said Mr Alexandre, president of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In response to soaring egg prices, Trump officials now say they want to move away from the slaughtering, focusing instead on preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told the BBC's US partner CBS News last week that he is working on a plan with newly confirmed USDA leader Brooke Rollins to combat the virus "with biosecurity and medication".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week," Hassett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Mr Alexandre said he was not sure that vaccinations and other precautions could replace the need to cull flocks - but he said new ideas were desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"What farmers and the USDA have been doing has just obviously not worked," he said. "We're in a crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Vaccines for birds against the avian flu already exist in countries around the world, and last week, the USDA granted conditional approval to a new shot developed by Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Still, many poultry industry groups oppose vaccinating birds against the virus. This is because most countries don't accept exports of poultry that are vaccinated because of fears that it masks the presence of the virus, said Tom Super of the National Chicken Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Public health experts have been critical of the US government's response to bird flu since the virus first spread to dairy cows, arguing Biden officials fell short in their disease surveillance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But Trump's team has slowed communications about the disease, which also concerns public health experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly withheld weekly reports on bird flu and canceled weeks of briefings with lawmakers and state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I haven't seen anything from this administration that would say that they're taking this outbreak any more seriously," Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ms Simoneau sees one encouraging sign from the Trump administration: Gerald Parker, a bird flu expert, veterinarian and former top-ranking health official, was chosen to lead the White House's Pandemic Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;At the same time, she said, the wide cuts and the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization under Trump's leadership could hamper efforts to respond to H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We're cutting ourselves off from that global information system at a time when we really need all of those signals that we can get," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ms Simoneau said fatigue and a decrease in trust in public health officials following the Covid pandemic makes for a difficult environment for any administration to respond to a potential health crisis.

Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bird flu does not spread human-to-human yet, but that could change rapidly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that variants of H5N1 have been around since the 1990s and it has yet to evolve into a strain that could cause a human pandemic. That’s because of how the virus is currently spreading, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, there are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="no reports" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;no reports&lt;/a&gt; of sustained human-to-human transmission associated with the current avian influenza strains circulating in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of cases have been in farm workers. Schaffner said unless you work closely with dairy cattle or with poultry like chickens, your risk of catching bird flu right at this moment is “essentially zero.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Russo, chief of the infectious disease division at the University at Buffalo, said there is not “grounds for panic” yet for a human pandemic because of the virus’ current inefficiencies. He noted that the bird flu infections in humans have occurred primarily in individuals that have had close contact with poultry or dairy cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N1 “does not efficiently infect humans, you need a more prolonged contact, probably a much higher dose,” he said. “And equally importantly, if not more importantly, those individuals that get infected, it doesn’t transmit well from human to human.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“This virus is now demonstrating some of those hallmarks of a potential public health threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Suresh Kuchipudi, veterinarian and chair of the infectious diseases and microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this does not mean the threat of a bird flu pandemic could not happen in the near future. “It may never be able to do it, but we don’t want to rule out that possibility,” Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said the avian influenza virus’ ability to infect so many different mammals ― including us ― is worrisome. Because the virus is now infecting multiple hosts simultaneously and continuously, “this virus is now demonstrating some of those hallmarks of a potential public health threat,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, a veterinarian and chair of the infectious diseases and microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each time it gets into a new host, that could accelerate the changes in the virus for adaptation,” Kuchipudi continued. “The more frequently that happens, the chances of the virus ... learning the skill of infecting that host becomes higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustained human-to-human transmission could just take the virus “one or two” mutations and “could happen anytime,” Kuchipudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one worst-case scenario, an animal like a pig could be infected both with bird flu and with human flu, and learn how to spread the virus better in what is known as “recombination,” Schaffner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on top of the virus’ uncertain evolution, the federal public health infrastructure that is necessary for fighting against pandemics is also facing an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, President &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="announced" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he was pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, which coordinates global responses to pandemics.

But if you want to know some ways to minimize the virus, there are a few lifestyle changes to consider if they’re relevant to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a cat owner, bring your pet inside. Cats enjoy chasing and eating birds, and are highly vulnerable to bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuchipudi co-authored a December &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#d1e337" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#d1e337" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on 10 outdoor domestic cats who died of H5N1 in South Dakota and had bird feathers found near them, indicating that the cats ate the virus-infected birds. If you notice any bird virus symptoms in cats ― &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="which include appetite loss, lethargy, tremors, seizures" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;which include appetite loss, lethargy, tremors, seizures&lt;/a&gt; ― you should immediately take your cat to a vet, so they can test your pet’s urine for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every infectious disease expert advised against letting you or your pet consume raw milk, because &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-042.aspx" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="bird flu virus has been detected in it" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-042.aspx" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;bird flu virus has been detected in it&lt;/a&gt;. But feel free to keep drinking pasteurized milk. By heating milk to a specific temperature over time, pasteurized milk kills potential viruses like H5N1 and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle#Status" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="continues to be safe to drink" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle#Status" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;continues to be safe to drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when in doubt about your bird flu exposure, it helps to fall back on simple hygiene practices. It is believed that dairy workers got the H5N1 virus through infected milk splatters and “touching infected milking equipment and then rubbing their eyes,” Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, personal protective equipment, such as high-quality, well-fitting masks, eye protection and gloves should be used when in contact with animals known to carry the virus. For example, if you feed wild birds, use gloves, and if you see a dead bird, be cautious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden's Viking Age population appears to have suffered from severe oral and maxillofacial disease, sinus and ear infections, osteoarthritis, and much more. This is shown in a study from the University of Gothenburg in which Viking skulls were examined using modern X-ray techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, researchers published a report based on the examination of a large number of teeth from the Viking Age population of Varnhem in the Swedish province of Västergötland. Varnhem is known for its thousands of ancient graves and excavations of well-preserved skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, odontologists at the University of Gothenburg have taken this research further, looking at not only teeth but also entire skulls, by using modern computed tomography, also known as CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detailed image analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9" target="_blank"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, presented in &lt;i&gt;BDJ Open&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the 15 individuals whose skulls were examined suffered from a broad range of diseases. The CT scans show pathological bone growths in the cranium and jawbone, revealing infections and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several individuals showed signs of having suffered from sinus or ear infections that left traces in the adjacent bone structures. Signs of osteoarthritis and various dental diseases were also found. All the skulls came from adults who died between 20 and 60 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study lead, Carolina Bertilsson, is an assistant researcher at the University of Gothenburg and a dentist within Sweden's Public Dental Service. The study was performed with specialists in dental radiology at the University of Gothenburg and an archaeologist from Västergötlands museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, they conducted the examinations and analyzed the images. CT scans provide &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/three-dimensional+images/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;three-dimensional images&lt;/a&gt; that enable researchers to study in detail the various types of skeletal damage, layer by layer, in the different parts of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/skull/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Greater understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was much to look at. We found many signs of disease in these individuals. Exactly why we don't know. While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures," says Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results of the study provide a greater understanding of these people's health and well-being. Everyone knows what it's like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help. But back then, they didn't have the medical and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dental+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental care&lt;/a&gt; we do, or the kind of pain relief—and antibiotics—we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is described as a pilot study. One important aspect was to test CT as a method for future and more extensive studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Very many of today's archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information," says Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costco seems to have everything a homeowner could possibly need. Whether you're on the hunt for &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1764984/costco-affordable-dinnerware-kitchenware/" target="_blank"&gt;affordable dinnerware and kitchenware&lt;/a&gt; or shopping for bulk inexpensive food items your household always plows right through, the Costco warehouse is always filled to the brim with opportunity. And, this newest viral product is further proof that the supermarket has the answer to every home issue; Costco's &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/thomasville-dillard-accent-chair-with-storage-ottoman.product.4000180371.html" target="_blank"&gt;Thomasville Dillard accent chair with storage ottoman&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable, cozy piece of furniture that will add storage and style to any room.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accent chair has over 600 five-star reviews on Costco's site, with users lauding its comfort, affordability, and storage. "This chair makes my living room look cozy and very classy," one Costco buyer wrote, adding that it's "very comfortable, and the extra storage space is a plus." Another reviewer chimed in: "I love that it has springs and not just foam. It's nice to curl up in and watch TV or read." Some shoppers warned that the chair is heavier than they expected, but Costco will typically assist shoppers with delivery and setup: "They delivered and set up free which was helpful to me as I'm a senior," one reviewer wrote. It retails for $599.99 but is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1770010/what-is-costco-direct-how-to-use-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;Costco Direct program, which you can use to your advantage&lt;/a&gt; and save money on this purchase if you bundle it with other items. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;How to style the Thomasville Dillard accent chair&lt;/h2&gt;
                                
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few gripes that Costco buyers had about this chair was its lack of color options. The light grey coloring can feel limiting, and it's also hard to fully get an idea of the color with just online photos. One reviewer described it as "a mix of grey and white, more on the warm side but not super warm toned." Another shopper called the chair "a very light grey that ... can match any style." With this input, it's safe to assume that the chair will fit in well with any gray tones, and will especially &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1740641/best-wall-paint-colors-complement-gray-floors/" target="_blank"&gt;complement gray floors&lt;/a&gt;. Try painting a matching accent wall, then get bookshelves to complete your reading nook, and fill them up with colorful books behind the chair. This is how Instagram creator That's My Bookshelf styled the piece in her home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if your space is more about earth tones, you can treat this chair as you would any white piece of furniture. Consider swapping the three gray pillows for your own colorful throw pillows that match other components of your living room, or placing a vibrant throw blanket on the arm to give it a pop of color. If the chair seems to be taking up too much space in your living room, you can move the ottoman to another place in your house, as it easily doubles as a storage bench that would be perfect in kids' playrooms or at the foot of a bed. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/article&gt;

It causes fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and vomiting, and can be fatal in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only two patients in the US have ever tested positive for MERS - both in May 2014 -and each case was linked to travel from the Middle East. There is no vaccine against the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Merbecoviruses have been detected in minks and pangolins - the animal believed to be the intermediary for Covid between bats and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, the scientists wrote, 'suggests frequent cross-species transmission of these viruses between bats and other animal species.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'This study reveals a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoVs in bats that efficiently use human [cells] and underscores their potential zoonotic risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HKU5-CoV viruses were first detected in bats in 2006, but the new data suggests HKU5-CoV-2 has a 'higher potential for interspecies infection' than others.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the potential for HKU5-CoV-2 to spill over to humans 'remains to be investigated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was conducted by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wuhan/index.html" id="mol-21275be0-f067-11ef-983a-d59410a7a5f9"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt; Institute of Virology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WIV is at the center of the lab-leak theory, which claims &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13220019/probe-covid-origins-lab-leak.html"&gt;Covid-19 was manufactured in a Chinese lab&lt;/a&gt; and accidentally leaked to the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newest study states a zoonotic spillover is believed to be responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic as bats have the highest proportion of coronaviruses and are considered reservoirs for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bats have the highest proportion of coronaviruses and are considered reservoirs for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while SARS and MERS have documented evidence of transmission between animals to humans, the 'intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study claiming to support the Covid-19 zoonotic theory is a 2023 report published &lt;span&gt;in the journal Nature and led by virus expert Ralph Baric of the University of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;North Carolina. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It found the strain of coronavirus harbored in pangolins, endangered animals in China that are sometimes consumed by humans, was nearly identical to the Covid-19 virus that caused the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has led some scientists to theorize the first cases of Covid-19 likely jumped from the animals to immunocompromised humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This gave the novel virus ample opportunity to mutate and replicate until it reached its full pandemic potential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, another camp of scientists insist the pandemic was sparked by a lab leak. This theory, subscribed to by some US federal agencies, posits Covid-19 was manufactured in a lab and accidentally escaped, which set off the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a 2018 research proposal, which was ultimately denied funding and did not go forward, saw scientists seeking to create a novel virus that had four characteristics matching features of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study claiming to support this theory was conducted in 2024 by researchers from Australia and Arizona.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They used a risk analysis tool - which they described as the most comprehensive yet - to determine the chances the SARS-CoV-2 virus was of 'unnatural' or 'natural' origin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team compared the characteristics of the virus and the pandemic to 11 criteria that analyzed things like the rarity of a virus, the timing of a pandemic, the population infected, the spread of a virus and the unexpected symptoms of a virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on the nature of Covid, researchers assigned a score to each category - less than 50 percent meant the pandemic would be classified as a natural outbreak, but 50 or more percent would mean the pandemic was an unnatural outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid received a score of 68 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:23:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPYjNTT0JYWXAtQlZpYi05cXhBU01rd3Rwc182b2tpVWM1b0cySy1vU21iRFZWdFpvTGNFX2NDZl94OThqY2xQdS1Wb2p5dUxiak81TnZSelFteEk3UHBWMFoxZ0tmT0VUcG5JQ3IzMXNvTms2Ni1jNDk0YzI5LWRSYzd6clVpX21IU3J6akhTZkwzREs5RkZpQTc3bUNTNS1oTmRtRkJPSWN1emhXOXF30gG0AUFVX3lxTE1adTZ4anNnNVBXekluRlNsMjBta1h4V2pjc05KWWpfc2RWaWNsSGtEVVBiT2JNZzBzWkVVTkpYcjNiNTQ5TmJxbjJOLUdtcGczYVIwVWRNWWlES2ZzdVg0ZEt1YlVDV1MzT3RTTGxXLXd2NTJQT0xvZ0N6dDB4d2tRMW43SWlJSkdlbHc4R1VDdFpPdGUyVFVBeFg4R050eUp4SWROMXVqdTZMQjU2VkI1UmthVg</guid></item><item><title>A measles outbreak is hitting Texas and New Mexico.

Measles is caused by the morvillivirus, which can lead to serious health complications, especially in children under 5 who aren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated individuals," Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Yahoo News. "If you have a significant population that has not been vaccinated, then measles can rip through those populations very quickly because it's one of the most highly transmissible virus agents we know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-does-measles-spread"&gt;How does measles spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks.

"It means a single individual can, on average, infect another 12 to 18 unvaccinated individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Airborne droplets of the virus can remain in a room for two hours, even after the person with measles has left the room, according to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8584-measles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.

However, that can change as we age because we're at an increased risk for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682456/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low vitamin consumption&lt;/a&gt;, partly because our bodies can no longer effectively absorb certain nutrients. So if you're dealing with deficiencies, are on specific medications or have particular health conditions, your doctor may advise you to take certain supplements to make sure your body has all the nutrients it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;These are the top six vitamins and minerals that doctors recommend you focus on for healthy aging. Just be sure to talk to your doctor first before adjusting your diet or trying new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said an unprocessed diet has about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet has less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;400 to 420 mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320 mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of ingredients. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist sports and exercise physician, said you can find magnesium in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;a supplement&lt;/a&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://aging.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nutrition-Needs_Vitamin-B12_FINAL-2.18.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;body cannot absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins like meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City, who is also part of CNET's medical review board, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000 mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200 mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" target="_self"&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/a&gt; are recommended to take 1,200 mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often called the sunshine vitamin because you typically absorb it through the skin just by being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough. Your body &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;needs vitamin D to properly absorb calcium&lt;/a&gt;, making it an important nutrient for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brukner says that in addition to sunshine, you can get vitamin D from fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, fortified milk and cereals. Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/supplements-white-house-advisor-fauci-takes-every-day-to-help-keep-his-immune-system-healthy.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Fauci noted that he took vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID pandemic) and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/multivitamins-memory-and-aging-everything-to-know/" target="_self"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Cleveland Clinic points out, your body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;isn't able to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/reap-the-benefits-of-omega-3s-with-these-heart-healthy-foods/" target="_self"&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/a&gt; or supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily." Fish oil and algae oil can also serve as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/pba.v5.25592" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in Pathobiology of Aging and Age-related Diseases, calls zinc an "essential micronutrient for human health in general, and particularly for the elderly." The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/pumping-iron-is-key-for-healthy-aging-heres-how-to-start/" target="_self"&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/a&gt; and other good habits, getting the right minerals and vitamins may improve your health. Try to get enough magnesium, B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, omega-3s and zinc in your diet each day. Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements to find out how they may interact with your existing medications and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPTHluRTZnQngwdlF0OEpHdGRLWlVENkZaTW1mODFWWUxCOEVRbzhWUmNlTXBuNll0Y3A4RUJWalYzQzNPbjI0cVRaN2c4Rk4zQVNIVEk5ZF9GbjJXWXkyMzEtV3JyX1puQXhINDJiWG9xOGV5Q3BCdHhiQnp1YUFDYzluZkVKZnpNLUF1MERRUWduV3BhMndsblpFSDlmM1NHV0Z0eU9IWUFPSFUyUzBxdVFWQ3U</guid></item><item><title>Ohio reports first pediatric flu death of the season - WKBN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQaHZ3ZTM2M1d4Q2pUcFNTY0ZzRU9qakxJZXB1V29TUVkxSDVmaklBSVRjRWI0SzhPcjBDWUw1cGhYU0pXUWgzUW9kU2hMa3lmUTNjcjEtSGNFa0tqUmdkazhURENNWXloOXFTUzNEWXdENU1lOWlPVWN6cEgxMXpRcG9ZdFl2aGJUb0ZGQdIBkgFBVV95cUxPUFJrUFNlNGRaVG1jNzRKUkMyV2pYNW53QllFVnBaZmdCdFRwV3BZZi1yUS1RWFExRnRQY0dYSHphTTJacEM5QVJncnNjeDZMU2F0Rmwwb1o5bzFCQzJRNW1nZVRoNzFOTWh4aHFGdVpjT21XTmR0ZElHelBJN0QwLVJEUTRrczJTRDV5YkhKUUMyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the American South was crawling with intestinal hookworms. Some initial surveys in the 1930s suggested nearly 54 percent of the population was infected, with prevalence in some areas as high as 76 percent. Through concerted deworming efforts and improved hygiene, the worms were largely flushed out over the subsequent decades. But as one medical editorial put it in 2017: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817787/"&gt;We still got 'em&lt;/a&gt;. That year, a study detected genetic traces of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/97/5/article-p1623.xml?tab_body=fulltext"&gt;N. americanus in the stool of more than a third of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tested in an impoverished community in Lowndes County, Alabama. In Lowndes, approximately 50 percent of households have failing or no sewage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creeping eruption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that's something you can enjoy thinking about before bed tonight, let's not forget that there's a second category of hookworms: the ones that bore into your body &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/zoonotichookworm/index.html"&gt;but generally don't make it into your intestines&lt;/a&gt;. This may seem like the better scenario than the intestinal group. But, that's only the case if you're ok with hookworm larvae wandering aimlessly through the layers of your skin, leaving an intensely itchy, serpentine rash, marked by redness and little pus-filled blisters in their wake. The rash is called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), or "creeping eruption."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second type of invasion is borne from worm-infested animals. The pack of parasites that cause CLM in people include hookworms that infect dogs and cats (&lt;em&gt;Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncinaria stenocephala&lt;/em&gt;), and in rarer cases cattle (&lt;em&gt;Bunostomum phlebotomum&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In animals, these hookworms live out a life cycle much like the intestinal cycle described earlier, with the parasites making themselves at home in the animals' small intestines. But, in humans, the worms find a dead-end. Most never make it out of the skin, roaming randomly until their death, which, without treatment, can take about five to six weeks. In their desperate meandering, some larvae—which measure 500 to 600 micrometers (0.05 to 0.06 centimeters) long—will travel several centimeters each day. Others can make it into deeper tissue, but become stuck. On occasion, &lt;em&gt;A. caninum&lt;/em&gt;—which normally infect dogs—have been known to make it to the intestines and partially develop. But they never complete their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Research consistently finds that alcohol can alter or raise hormone levels, including estrogen. Higher levels of the hormone can lead to mutations in breast tissue that cause cancer. “Even drinking within the guidelines, so one a day for women,” can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, LoConte says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Put another way, research finds about 11 out of every 100 women who consume less than one alcoholic beverage will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, as noted in the Surgeon General’s advisory. Two more than that, or 13 in every 100 women, who have one drink a day, and 15 in 100 women who have two drinks per day, will develop breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Of course, drinking is but one prominent risk factor that could raise a woman’s risk of developing cancer. Many others, starting with age, obesity, genetics/family history and environmental exposures (to radiation, for example), can also stack the deck against a person. Doctors encourage &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/mammogram-guidelines-breast-cancer-screening.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="breast cnacer screenings"&gt;considering all risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“If you’re a postmenopausal woman and there is a reason why your risk is higher than normal for breast cancer,” it’s important to factor that in when choosing whether to drink — and how much to drink, says William Dahut, M.D., chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouth, throat and esophageal cancers: The “dose-dependent” dangers of drinking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Although head and neck cancers aren’t as common as breast cancer, the alcohol-related risk of developing these cancers is more pronounced and increases more sharply the more a person drinks.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;That risk is present even when a person stays within the recommended limit, which is two drinks per day for men (and, again, one drink per day for women), LoConte says. She recommends abiding by those guidelines at a minimum, “but really getting as low as comfortable” is ideal, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;LoConte was the lead author of a 2018 statement on &lt;a data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

            &lt;p&gt;Heavy drinkers — which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines as men who consume five or more drinks on any day or 15 drinks or more per week, and women who have four or more drinks on any day or eight or more per week — developed oral cavity (mouth) and pharynx (throat) cancers and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at around five times the rate of non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;A predominant cause of these and other alcohol-related cancers (and a contributor to breast cancer) is a byproduct of the body’s breakdown of alcohol called acetaldehyde, which can damage DNA. Once damaged, cells can grow out of control and turn into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

bananas, meanwhile, are “packed with antioxidants,” the doctor says ― including &lt;a

bananas, meanwhile, are “packed with antioxidants,” the doctor says ― including &lt;a

"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also got the highest vitamin C and B5 levels, and because that resistant starch we mentioned earlier has all but gone by the time the banana’s yellow, it;s far easier to digest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes it perfect for a pre-workout snack, &lt;a

    &lt;p&gt;“We all get exactly the same virus but it’s the amount of protective layer and amount of reserve that you’ve got available,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A young, fit person will only need 10 per cent of their reserve to fight the flu virus, whereas an older adult might need 100 per cent. The body throws absolutely everything at the virus and there’s nothing left for the next thing that comes along.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bronchitis means that the lining of the airways is inflamed and irritated,” Dr Strain explains. “&lt;em&gt;Bronchus&lt;/em&gt; is the airways [the tube that carries air from your windpipe into your lungs] and &lt;em&gt;itis &lt;/em&gt;means inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the body’s response to flu but can also be caused by other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a young, healthy person develops bronchitis, the protective layer in their respiratory tract will very quickly heal over,” Dr Strain says. “For older adults, it takes them much, much longer for the protective layers to heal over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, they are vulnerable to a bacterial infection, which occurs if the normal bugs living in the airways penetrate through the damaged mucus lining. This can ultimately lead to pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs, usually caused by an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body senses that inflammation has occurred (for example, as a result of bronchitis) and bacteria is present, the immune system releases white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, whose job it is to ward off infection and inflammation, Dr Strain explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But these cells can clog up the alveoli – tiny air sacs in the lungs that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged – so that we can’t breathe properly,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, emergency admissions for pneumonia range between 130,000 to 270,000 per year and it is fatal in 5-14 per cent of hospitalised cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of people who are dying from pneumonia are already in their last two years of life,” Dr Strain explains. For patients with lots of health problems, it’s usually the thing that pushes them over the edge, he adds. Flu and pneumonia were responsible for more than 24,000 deaths (or 4.2 per cent of all deaths in England and Wales) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An influenza infection will cause flu-like symptoms, including a sudden high temperature, an aching body and exhaustion. At this stage, turn to simple paracetamol and drink plenty of fluids to manage symptoms, Dr Strain says. Antibiotics don’t work against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a fever burns lots of extra energy, so bringing a fever down with paracetamol will actually help people to get better quicker,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, bronchitis usually clears up on its own within weeks by drinking lots of fluid, getting plenty of rest and taking paracetamol to ease symptoms. “You don’t need to be in hospital if you can continue to drink fluids and still feel lucid,” Dr Strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient has pneumonia, they are usually given antibiotics and get better at home within two to four weeks, though older and at-risk patients will likely be admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As soon as a person starts behaving differently – it could be that they become erratic, hyper-emotional or completely withdrawn – that’s the time we need to see them in hospital,” Dr Strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if they are still at the viral [flu] stage, we need to make sure they’re not at risk of a bacterial infection. It’s a bacterial infection, on top of their viral infection, that’s going to do damage,” he says. Doctors can find out if a bacterial infection has occurred through a quick blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the infection is viral, then the patient will be given fluids and paracetamol, just as they would at home, but if there’s any evidence of a bacterial infection, there will be heavy-duty antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours, Dr Strain says. “Getting on top of that as quickly as possible is really beneficial for patients,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding catching flu or another respiratory infection in the first place is the key step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While infections can be unavoidable, sensible steps like avoiding people who’ve got a viral illness – including telling family to delay a visit if they’ve got a cough and cold – is simple but effective, Dr Strain says. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/covid-vaccine-nhs-autumn-jabs/"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; means a flu infection is more likely to be mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to prevent frailty by keeping active, Dr Strain says. “Frailty – the inability to tackle infections as they hit you – is what’s going to put you in hospital,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going out for your daily five minute walk to pick up the newspaper, or even just getting out a few times a week, is very clearly demonstrated to boost your immune system,” Dr Strain notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who keep active, they will still feel terrible when hit with a respiratory infection, but they’re going to bounce back from it quickly, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more frail a person is, the longer it will take to recover from pneumonia, he notes. “It can take several months to build your strength back up to where you were and it’s important for those picking up their loved one from hospital to know that they’re not going to be as strong as they were.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, we cannot make people live forever,” says Dr Strain. “What we want to do is keep them as healthy as possible until they die. And pneumonia is the thing that tends to be the final straw for people who have problems with their health.”&lt;/p&gt;

This comes after a surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_118453245" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-118453245"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years. They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the newly discovered virus HKU5-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is still no consensus on the origin of the virus, some studies suggest it originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate animal host.

Tomatoes belong to the same plant family, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae"&gt;Solanaceae&lt;/a&gt;, and produce toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, generally, tomatoes don't kill us.&lt;/p&gt;

Sichuan University biologist Feng Bai and colleagues have now identified the genetic mechanisms involved in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-a-tomato-is-actually-both-a-fruit-and-vegetable"&gt;tomato fruit's&lt;/a&gt; safe transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152887" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642.jpg" alt="Scientists Have Just Discovered How Tomatoes Don't Kill Us" class="size-full wp-image-152887" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152887" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Average fruit size in the cultivated tomato in comparison with its semi-domesticated and fully wild relatives. (&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/modern-tomatoes-are-very-different-from-their-wild-ancestors-and-we-found-missing-links-in-their-evolution-130041"&gt;Hamid Razifard/CC BY-ND-4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solanaceae make use of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanine"&gt;steroidal glycoalkaloids&lt;/a&gt; as a natural defense against pests. These molecules are thought to mess with animal cell membranes, damaging them and eventually causing cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://molhort.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s43897-024-00118-y"&gt;Potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, another member of this toxic family, have been cultivated to have safe levels of these compounds, though they can pump them out when damaged or exposed to large amounts of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, this glycoalkaloid substance tastes unpleasantly bitter. Ingesting too much leads to a burning sensation in the mouth, followed by symptoms including nausea, cramps, slow pulse and reduced breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, internal bleeding, and stomach lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these same plants also need their seeds dispersed, and animals are great at this. So in some of the plants, as their seed-bearing fruits ripen, the bitter toxic chemicals are converted into something more palatable to entice &lt;a href="https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/plant-seed-dispersal-animal-poo"&gt;pooping seed taxis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bai and team discovered that in tomatoes, the chemicals that make the fruits redder, softer, and sweeter also coordinate the breakdown of the toxic glycoalkaloid into a less toxic compound called esculeoside A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[This helps] ensure that high levels of toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids remain in immature fruits to maintain resistance against herbivory attacks, guaranteeing that the fruits reach the seed maturation stage," the team &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads9601"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deliciously fruited plants make use of epigenetic regulation to control the cascade of changes required to make their bounty safe for us to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a protein called DML2 allows the cell's gene-reading machinery to access genes involved in stopping the toxins by removing methyl groups, which act as molecular signals, from a specific part of the genetic chromosome – a process called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demethylation"&gt;demethylation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYHBbEKap0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers genetically disabled the creation of DML2 in the tomatoes, the fruit produced still contained high levels of the steroidal glycoalkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genes involved in other related plants, Bai and team also found &lt;em&gt;DML2-&lt;/em&gt;driven DNA demethylation increased during the tomato plant's domestication, which changed the plants from small berry producers to large red fruit creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the levels of genes supporting steroidal glycoalkaloids also decreased. Now, even green tomatoes can be safely eaten in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes ultimately made this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tomato-juice-can-kill-salmonella-the-bacteria-that-terrorizes-our-guts"&gt;gut-protecting crop&lt;/a&gt; healthier for us all to devour, and in return, we spread tomatoes across new continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads9601"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, both workers had shown symptoms suggestive of infection, the study said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, a worker who wasn’t employed on a farm but transported unpasteurized milk between farms reported conjunctivitis. The other person worked on a dairy farm and reported seeing several dead barn cats on the premises. He suffered gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting the day before a pet cat became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both workers also ended communication with health officials before the investigation was over, with one citing fear of losing employment for implicating dairy farms, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two adolescents living in one of the worker’s homes also became sick. Both tested negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I., said the paper raises more questions than it answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known that cats can become ill with H5N1,” she said. “This paper raises, but does not answer, the question of whether farmworkers may spread H5N1 to their cats. We need to know more about how this may have occurred, as it could inform our understanding of whether people can spread the virus to other animals, including other humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the workers declined to be tested for the virus, the authors could not conclude that they had passed the virus to their pet cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, a 5-year-old indoor cat belonging to one of the dairy workers was brought to a local veterinary clinic after showing decreased appetite, disinterest in grooming, disorientation and tiredness. After not improving over two more days, the cat was referred to the Michigan State University Veterinary Medical Center., where the cat was euthanized after “rapid disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the cat’s owner was a dairy farm worker, and there were reports of H5N1 in local dairy farms, the cat’s body was sent to the university’s diagnostic laboratory, where tests confirmed the presence of the virus. That discovery triggered the investigation by state public health officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second dairy worker household, a 6-month-old Maine Coon cat that lived exclusively indoors was brought directly to the Michigan State veterinary clinic. The cat also tested positive for the virus and died 24 hours later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second cat in the household had no symptoms and tested negative for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cats’ owner reported not wearing protective equipment and being frequently splashed by milk in the eyes and face, and on clothing. The worker told investigators that the Maine coon cat would often roll in those clothes, something the second cat never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner reported experiencing eye irritation that began two days before the coon cat got sick. The owner wasn’t tested for influenza, declined antiviral treatment and ended communication with the investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is depressing and will continue until we have more severe illnesses reported that scare people,” said John Korslund, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian and researcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said his biggest concern is the time lag among infection, symptoms and testing, which can be on the order of three days to two weeks — a pause that enables the virus to move undetected through farms and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are consistently testing humans much too late — after cow herds have shown clinical signs and workers have ‘recovered,’” he said. “If we want to get serious about finding human H5 infections, we’ll need to use rapid tests in [workers’] homes when the eyes first are red, independent of what is happening in the herd on the farm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The workers, the cats, and the bulk milk samples are the best sentinels for early dairy herd diagnoses,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:00:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxNcFVhQ2RTYlc3M3hmZmoyUEM2RmwtemFWVWpnemlHVnpDUk1GRjBPTlBYQVRSTHk2X2JZUWJxTzAxRWNaNU9lMDVCcjAzTWcwanAyMkt3RVQ3TWVqSG1YUng0X0IzXy1TZmlqc3c2X0tMdnhsZEJPVy1wSElSMU42bEVQZmg1dldRNmx5WmpmbGZ4R1dkT29pa290UUo3Wi12dWtjQ2t6YlcxNkhKYm1lSEQ5SXVTRDNkekFzaXEyUE1vUG1vTW1Ca0V6Yw</guid></item><item><title>Soaring Egg Prices Reignite Debate Over Bird Flu Vaccinations - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE4yOUlyVFlpcTQ0RHVzNkZibTZURFUweEt2bDFYMVZoT212eTQwREJPRmkwRTdaenY3eXFjMVZmV0ZtUURPaFhYeklBa1B2WHFaR2E5RktRb1lCdXduQ01YR3dvU29hc0xjVjRmc2x0d2ktWXp6VnZTMENPZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE4yOUlyVFlpcTQ0RHVzNkZibTZURFUweEt2bDFYMVZoT212eTQwREJPRmkwRTdaenY3eXFjMVZmV0ZtUURPaFhYeklBa1B2WHFaR2E5RktRb1lCdXduQ01YR3dvU29hc0xjVjRmc2x0d2ktWXp6VnZTMENPZw</guid></item><item><title>Is yellow mucus a sign you're healing?

Some schools are temporarily closing due to illnesses, and some hospitals are overwhelmed with patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 activity is also high or very high in 30 states, according to wastewater &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But can you really tell what kind of illness you have or where you are in your infection based on your mucus? Here’s a breakdown of what goes on inside our body when we’re sick and why mucus changes colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is mucus? Why does your body produce it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucus is the body’s natural moisturizer and provides a first line of defense against irritants from the outside environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lubricates the lining of the nose when it gets too dry but also traps outside invaders, like germs and dust, because of how sticky it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies produce mucus as both a normal way to help maintain good health and to help one fight off infection,” Glatt states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal mucus often looks clear or white for most people, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mucus changes color, depending on the individual’s environment, in response to various germs and more, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does yellow mucus mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus means your body's immune system has been activated, which can change the color or consistency of your mucus, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mucus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, during an infection, the mucus will be clear, but it usually changes to yellow within a few days. Many people believe that yellow or green mucus indicates a bacterial infection, but experts caution that color doesn’t correlate to a particular type of infection, as both viruses and bacteria can cause yellow mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus could also be caused by non-infectious triggers, like allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does yellow mucus mean a cold is healing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical viral respiratory infection, such as the common cold, mucus in the nose starts out as clear but gradually turns yellow or green as the infection progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So essentially, yellow mucus just means your immune system has been activated. For &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/signs-your-cold-is-getting-better-rcna127645" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:signs your cold is getting better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;signs your cold is getting better&lt;/a&gt;, look for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mucus turning clear again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your symptoms becoming less severe, like having fever body aches and less nasal congestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week has passed and you're feeling overall better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your energy coming back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What stage of infection is yellow mucus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It often is an early sign of an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/scott-c-roberts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Scott Roberts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, however, cautions to not judge mucus by its color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends paying more attention to the consistency of the mucus — whether there is thick pus or not — to know if you have a sinus infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, thin mucus may be a sign of an early infection, but as the mucus thickens, this suggests more severe congestion in the nose, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does green mucus mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green mucus is also a sign that your body either has encountered an irritant or is experiencing an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mucus may go from a clearer appearance to a much more infected (pus-like) and green appearance in response to viral or bacterial infection,” Glatt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mucus may also change from yellow to green as it becomes more concentrated, often when we are sleeping or not well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth is that green mucus is a tell-tale sign of a bacterial infection, but both viruses and bacteria can cause this color change. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2020/march/what-your-nasal-discharge-says-about-your-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:past research has found;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;past research has found&lt;/a&gt; that nasal discharge turns different colors due to the presence of white blood cells, which battle the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one clue you might need antibiotics is persistent thick, green discharge lasting for more than 10 days, &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-nasal-mucus-color-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do other mucus colors mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucus often changes colors when dead cells, germs and other substances, like blood or tobacco smoke, gets mixed with it, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mucus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. These colors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink: &lt;/strong&gt;Mucus can turn pink after an injury to the nose when it gets streaked with blood. It can also be a sign your nasal passages are so dry that tiny blood vessels that line them have burst and leaked blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt;: This may be a sign of a more severe infection like bronchitis or pneumonia. It is also common during colder seasons (when the air in our homes have less humidity), which leads to dry nasal passages that cause small amounts of blood from tiny burst blood vessels in the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black&lt;/strong&gt;: This could be old, dried blood. The mucus can also turn black when environmental irritants, like dust particles, smoke or other air pollutants, get stuck in the nasal passages. Serious fungal infections can darken mucus as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get rid of mucus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Druckman says “fluids and rest are key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making sure you’re drinking enough water will help flush out any mucus and help thin it out, and getting adequate rest will help your body heal faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way to reduce the effects of mucus is to place a humidifier in your room, which can help loosen your mucus a bit and make it easier to manage,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For optimal drainage, it’s recommended to sleep with your head slightly elevated and to ease symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other home remedies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal rinses, which help clear the mucus from your nose and sinuses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decongestants to temporarily decrease inflammation in the nose and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectorants to thin out the mucus so it’s easier to clear it out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines to calm down the body’s immune system, which causes excess mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel something is exactly right about the color or consistency of your mucus, check in with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duration of symptoms also matters. You should also seek medical attention if you have persistent colored mucus and symptoms for more than a week, Druckman adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other warning signs are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark-colored mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much blood mixed in with mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thick nasal discharge with facial pain lasting longer than 10 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent fevers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runny nose with a persistent cough or chest tightness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe symptoms not improving with home remedies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To stay protected, I recommend getting the flu vaccine, washing hands frequently, and staying home when feeling unwell,” Druckman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking these steps can help reduce the spread and protect yourself and those around you during flu season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/yellow-mucus-meaning-rcna192836" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:21:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE41RVhUZEpCMXZQOXRXaGtFXzV6YzFnNnFTeXJBSEZKSTBNZW5Ha2tSUlJuN2ZPUXIzZnhVY3BqZmVWTHlDcmNfYnZBbXhwQUtHLTRPMnl1em1Hd1FRU3lpdTFWRkp5czZVSUJYZnBRUHVaaXdw</guid></item><item><title>A New Study Reveals Eating These Seeds Could Do Wonders for Your Health - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFB3ejY2UEFQYXkxaGZaWGNodDg4UTF0ZWFJU0xWNW01NG5ZUlBPVHlRNkM5R2w1c19feDJ4SkZPankzUm53VGV3b1hQU21nRUUzbG1CMUdBOU9TR0VkWlFDNl9mMVVuWUVvT3VlY2pwbnlmVU9BekE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Chia Seeds Really Are That Healthy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fcafotodigital - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many foods these days sport "health halos," meaning that they are touted all over social media as super healthy, even if they don’t deliver (we're looking at you, coconut oil and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a44852/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:apple cider vinegar!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;apple cider vinegar!&lt;/a&gt;).

In addition to omega-3s, protein, fiber, Iu notes that chia seeds are rich in minerals like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these nutrients have positive effects on your body, recent research shows. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39299649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; from Iraq and Iran found that chia seed consumption can lower blood pressure and cholesterol, could potentially help lower body weight and may help prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Chinese researchers are looking into why that is, and &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo02197a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that chia seeds contain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bioactive-molecule" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bioactive macromolecular substances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bioactive macromolecular substances&lt;/a&gt; like oil, protein and gum.

Chia seeds can even help relieve constipation by adding bulk to your stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to bring some chia love into your diet? Here’s how to use chia seeds to your best nutritional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat chia seeds every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can indeed eat them every day. “A serving size of chia seeds is 1 tablespoon,” says &lt;a href="https://anitamirchandani.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anita Mirchandani MS RD CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anita Mirchandani MS RD CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and personal trainer in New York City, who recommends one serving a day. “A little goes a long way!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you overdo chia seeds, they could make you pretty uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt; – think: major gas and bloating. “Be cautious with chia seeds if you have digestive issues like irritable bowel disease, or if you're sensitive to high fiber,” says Iu. “The right amount to consume will vary by individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Mayo Clinic &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chia-seeds-pack-nutritional-punch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:specifically reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;specifically reports&lt;/a&gt; that a serving of chia seeds (which they count as 2.5 tbs) contains 10 grams of fiber. When sprinkling chia seeds on yogurt or into a chicken salad, it’s not hard to use that much. But even if you don’t have digestive sensitivity, eating more than that could give you diarrhea. Your smartest move, says Iu, is to take things slowly, see how you feel after trying a single tablespoon of chia seeds, and if you feel good, gradually increase the amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some great ways to use chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although chia seeds can be eaten raw, eating them with soft or liquid consistency foods can help your body get used to them more easily (and it is possible to choke if you scarf too many dry chia seeds at once.) Chia seeds contain &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health-products/g43632266/best-fiber-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:soluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and so absorb liquid and expand. “Chia seeds can be added to oatmeal or &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g4060/healthy-smoothie-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;,” says Mirchandani. “I’ve heard people add it to rice dishes because of the consistency, too. My go-to is to soak chia seeds overnight in milk or water, making them into a pudding to have the next morning.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Mykola Sosiukin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it’s time to experiment more. “You can sprinkle chia seeds onto yogurt, or enjoy them as a crunchy addition to salad,” says Moore. “You can also stir chia seeds into cooked berries to make a simple berry jam. They’re versatile in the kitchen – chia seeds are non-perishable, putting nutrition conveniently at your fingertips.” Iu keeps her chia seeds in a cute glass jar in her kitchen: “I keep it visible near my breakfast items, which makes it easy for me to sprinkle chia seeds over toast or in &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35688305/congee-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:congee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;congee&lt;/a&gt; or juices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What not to do: &lt;strong&gt;Don’t add loads of butter or sugar to your chia dish – that pretty much negates the overall health-factor. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should not eat chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are allergic to chia seeds. A study from Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)02196-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found that this allergy is rare;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;found that this allergy is rare&lt;/a&gt;, and most often affects Hispanic women and those who have a sensitivity to sesame. Chia seed allergy can cause &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fanaphylaxis%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20351468&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fa63785578%2Fare-chia-seeds-really-healthy%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anaphylaxis,;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;anaphylaxis, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so if you have any reason to think you might be allergic to them, have your health care provider do a prick test of your skin before you try them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other folks who should give them a miss are those who have trouble swallowing, says Moore, and eating too many at once for anyone could be a choking hazard. Be especially careful about giving chia seeds to your kids for this reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFB3ejY2UEFQYXkxaGZaWGNodDg4UTF0ZWFJU0xWNW01NG5ZUlBPVHlRNkM5R2w1c19feDJ4SkZPankzUm53VGV3b1hQU21nRUUzbG1CMUdBOU9TR0VkWlFDNl9mMVVuWUVvT3VlY2pwbnlmVU9BekE</guid></item><item><title>Ultraprocessed Foods: How Bad Could They Be? - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOU3F0QjE3cTl1SVdyQVVNSnFoc3BTUkxrSkdfWThyVTJwREk3OXI5M3I4Y2dkM2RRcVRGVUJQUGtRZzJ0R1AxWElodUtVa2RHb0I3VWtTTHRzRUQtTHR1czRNbXhSRGZjZXcySURPMVhidTdMblFPaEtXZkFlalhVdzVhVGQxLUlVZmZGdjBRMUJpYUpMMHFJVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Today, I'm sitting down with my colleague and my friend, CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell. You know, Meg is a really talented journalist. She writes. She's on TV all the time. She's guest hosted a few episodes of this podcast. But as you just heard, Meg's other full time job, more important job is mom to two young boys. How much do you think about their their diet?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's kind of a balance for me between letting my anxiety take over about what they're not eating and all the nutrients I'm worried they're not getting, and just making sure they get enough calories.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:52
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Like all great reporters, Meg lets her personal curiosity lead the way. And lately, she's been doing some deep dives on something we see all around us, but definitely don't know enough about ultra processed foods.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Like, how are you supposed to figure out, like, what's healthy to eat? Are you supposed to avoid 70% of foods in our food system?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'And I do want to point out that ultra processed foods contain ingredients that you would not typically find in your kitchen. Some are even made using industrial cooking methods not accessible to the average home chef. Now, Meg has talked about this topic before on the podcast, but I wanted to invite her back to discuss the latest science of ultra processed foods because, in part, the quality of our food supply has been a hot topic during the RFK Jr's confirmation hearings, and also because Meg recently took this really fascinating reporting trip to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health researchers there are trying to answer two fundamental questions. Number one, what is it that actually makes ultra processed foods so bad for us? And number two, could those ultra processed foods one day be considered healthy? I know, I know. Ultra-processed foods being healthy? Well, the answers could shape U.S. food policy. They could guide how we feed ourselves and our families for a long time to come. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Oh, and one more thing. Meg and I took a close look at what goes into some of my favorite foods.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:02:42
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Uh-oh, you're inside sources may not like me, so I'm scared. It was, let's just say, an enlightening experience. I remember your last time you were on the podcast talking about this. If you can't buy these ingredients, or if you wouldn't do this at home yourself, that's probably a good indication that what you're eating is ultra processed. Fair?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And when you read these ingredient list, there's a lot of things on there that you would never buy in a store. You would never add these things to yourself. So you go to the grocery store you're trying to buy well, for your for yourself, your family, your husband. How much of what you're buying is likely to be ultra processed?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Unless you're trying to avoid it the majority of the stuff that you're going to find is probably ultra processed. I mean, unless you're going to the bakery section, we don't know what the freshly baked breads, that might not be ultra processed, but it might be. You don't know.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, if you asked, would you know? And how would you find out?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, probably. You could probably ask for the ingredients list and see if there's any weird thing in there.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:03:47
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I don't know, but no one does that. Right. Because it seems like I need to go buy my groceries and like, I might do it after talking to you, but it's where, I guess if you buy, if you eat meat. Going to the to the fresh meat section, you could probably be pretty confident that it's not ultra processed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Probably. Deli meat though, you know, might have some preservatives or some other things in it that could make it ultra processed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's really hard.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:11
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'll ask some version of this question a couple times, but as as difficult and maybe even dire as that all sounds, is it necessarily bad for you?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's the question that scientists are trying to answer now. And the studies that we've had up until now, there have been a lot of them. Dozens and dozens have showed a lot of negative health effects linked to ultra processed foods. They're looking back at people's diets, and they find that people who report eating more ultra processed foods have higher levels of obesity, diabetes, even anxiety, and even things like all cause mortality, which you know, is a confusing thing. It's like we're all going to die, but are you going to die sooner if you eat more ultra processed foods? It seems like yeah, maybe. But the problem with these studies is they're backwards looking. So scientists have just started to try to run these, randomized controlled trials of how people eat. And that requires trapping people so they can't cheat. So we went down to the NIH, where they've been running these studies. Some of the only studies like this in the world, the first one they ran came out in 2019, and that was just looking at ultra processed foods versus minimally processed foods. People had to live at the NIH for a month. You know, half the time they're on the minimally processed diet and half the time they're on the ultra processed diet. They were giving them basically identically matched diets based on the nutrients in them. And you know, how the foods looked and things like that. But at the end of this time, they found, that people on average, ate about 500 calories more per day on the ultra processed diet, and over two weeks they gain about 2 pounds. So they were offered the same number of calories on each of the diets, and they ended up eating more calories on the ultra processed diet, perhaps without realizing it, because there's something about ultra processed foods that just made folks eat more of them and that made them gain weight.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, it's funny going back to these just basic definitions. I think a lot of people, and even as I was thinking about this podcast with you, I was talking to my wife about this. I said, just like, what is your your immediate instinct when you think of ultra processed foods? And she immediately said the additives, like, might they be toxic in some way? Might they be increasing my risk of cancer or something like that? Right? I'm not sure I even got asked this question, Meg, but but how much of this is about the additives are bad versus what they're doing in terms of making me crave it that's bad?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We don't know yet. But now Doctor Kevin Hall at the NIH is running that study.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What we're trying to understand is what are the mechanisms? What is it about this category of foods that is driving people to overconsume calories, potentially leading to obesity and these downstream consequences?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So he took the results of the first studies, looked at the clues they got from how people chose to eat in that trial. And he has two hypotheses about what might be driving overeating with ultra processed foods. One is their energy density. So how many calories you're getting in each gram of food you're eating. And it so happens that ultra processed foods are much more energy dense than minimally processed foods. And he says, really that's because they take a lot of the water out of them so that they don't like rot. They're more shelf stable. And then the other thing he's hypothesizing is they're hyper palatability, or we've heard the term the bliss point. So it's this combination of salt, sugar, fat and carbs that's just the right levels that make us like, not want to stop eating foods. And so what he's done is with their nutrition team, devised four different diets. One is minimally processed, one is ultra processed, very similar to the first trial. High hyper palatability, high energy dense. And then two other diets that kind of mix. They're ultra processed, but they vary how hyper palatable they are and how energy dense they are. And what he's trying to see is, can you eat a diet that's made up mostly of ultra processed foods, but that doesn't drive overeating and perhaps all of the other health effects of that, if it's less energy dense or if it's less hyper palatable.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And if we can figure that out, then we can provide our, you know, our our colleagues at the FDA, for example, regulators with information about, you know, how they might want to label foods for example.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:34
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              When he was doing this research, I'm sure these these participants who are in the trial, they they knew why they were they're being studied. Did you get a chance to talk to any of them? I'm curious what their sort of experience was going through a study like this, because you have to be in the you're essentially an inpatient, right?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So we got to meet one of the participants in this trial. There's only 36 of them. So it was like really cool to get to meet one of these 36 people who's going to potentially influence the way we think about our food and food policy. Same. Sam Reseda, he's 20. He is a pre-med student. So he's in college, which I thought was super cool. So how long have you been here?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Two weeks. How how has it been so far?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's been fine. I mean, I have my PlayStation, my electronics. Honestly feels like a dorm room for me.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And, yeah, he's, he's allowed to go outside. But somebody has to follow him, you know?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:09:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Really make sure you can't go sneak a Snickers bar.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Go to a vending machine. There was a vending machine strangely close to the metabolic ward. I was like, come on, guys, it's like, why are you doing this for these people? And they track almost everything you can track about a person. He was wearing a continuous glucose monitor. He's wearing, like, three trackers of his movement. They were doing stool samples so they could look at what's going on with this microbiome. They were taking regular blood from him and separating that into all these components to see the effects of food on all kinds of things, including his immune system. And then one of the other things that makes the NIH one of the only places in the world that can do this kind of study is they have one of these things called a metabolic chamber. Participants like Sam come in here for 24 hours at a time, once a week. This room measures literally the air they breathe in and breathe out. They're trying to measure their metabolism, and the only way they can get them food is they've got this little window that, you know, they open on one side, but the food and clothes he opens on the other side.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:10:23
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Kind of sounds like prison.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And he's in there for 24 hours. I asked him how he feels when it comes out. He's like, it's like coming out of one of those, like, cryogenic freezers or like Austin Powers or something.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:10:34
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              When you say that this might impact food policy and this is a what if sort of crystal ball question, but what might that look like? You have a study like this that Kevin Hall is doing at the NIH. What could that translate to?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, his hope is that he can, you know, generate this evidence. That'll be good, strong evidence telling us these answers about food. And if he finds, you know, that foods that are super hyper palatable and high in energy density do lead to this overeating, you can provide that information to a regulator like the FDA as they're considering food policy. Does that change the way you label food? Do you put like, a green light on something that's low energy density and low hyper palatable and or whatever other metrics that are found to be important, or is it used in a different way by regulators? You know, we've we've heard about initiatives to try to lower salt in foods, for example. Could you mandate that food companies lower the the bliss point of some of their foods. Can can you do that kind of thing. I mean we, we don't know. But Kevin Hall wants to provide the information so that regulators can figure out what to do with it, but also so that we as consumers have more information and feel better equipped when we walk into the grocery store. If you could still get these very convenient foods and lower cost foods, but they wouldn't cause those problems. That could help us a lot without just saying, okay. When you go to the grocery store, you can only go to the vegetable section. You can only go to the, you know, the butcher or whatever it is coming up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Meg and I are going to discuss some of those challenges of food regulation, and also, importantly, what lessons you should take to the grocery store the next time you go. I remember I interviewed Michelle Obama years ago when she was very focused on food, and it was a wide ranging discussion. But one of the things that sort of jumped out at me was this idea that, you know, if you're trying to feed a family of five and you go to McDonald's, you know, you can buy a lot of calories for cheap. And I don't know how much of that just the cost of calories has driven sort of where we are now. But, you know, 20, 25 bucks and you can feed your family that night versus going and buying all these, less processed, minimally processed, highly watered, dense foods that are, I think, agreeably good for you but just aren't going to leave your kids satisfied. There's still going to be maybe hungry because there wasn't enough calories in that. How much do you think this is just about cost?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think a lot of it is about cost. In the first study, they also looked at the costs to prepare the diets, and these were being prepared by chefs. So we're not even talking about the time it took to prepare these diets. But the cost, it was significantly more expensive to eat a minimally processed diet than an ultra processed diet. I think it was like almost 50%.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:13:28
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Really that much more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. But, you know, it's it's convenient. It's less expensive to eat ultra processed foods. I mean, having to prepare an entire meal for minimally processed foods can take hours. I mean, I'm not a very good cook. I try to do it like on weekends, but it's really hard. And one of the things that really made me feel better was I asked Kevin Hall how he feeds his own family. He's got little kids. Yeah, he still gives them chicken nuggets, you know? And for me, I'm like, oh, I'm on the Applegate farm ones. Those are fine, right? Like, you know, I'm sure there's like different degrees of, like, ultra processed chicken nuggets. I'm just happy they're eating chicken. I hope it's chicken.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

                00:14:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. Our definition of what is acceptable and even healthy changes when you have kids. I think for sure. And I will admit that I found myself eating my kids food often.  You know, cleaning up their plate when they hadn't eaten there. There is. That's a mix of why I gained weight. Maybe I'm starting to lose weight a little bit now because my kids have just gotten older.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Not eating their scraps anymore?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm not eating the scraps anymore. You know, one thing that comes up a lot and you may or may not know the answer to this, but, you know, people will often say to me, like, I'll go to Italy or I go to Europe and I'll, I'll eat basically the same foods, like I have pasta dinners. I might even have some dessert and things like that. And I find myself feeling better, not gaining as much weight. Maybe even losing weight despite having the same diet. I guess the question is, how unique is the United States and all this?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'It's not unique. But it is - We do have a lot of our calories from ultra processed foods. It is sort of happening all over the world. But you also do hear about how in Europe they have a different approach to regulating additives in food and regulating all sorts of things, you know. I think it's called the precautionary principle, where they actually think, okay, we should figure out what this does, maybe before we allow it to be in our products. Whereas in the United States, we often sort of allow things to come in and then we we see what effect they have. And, I think a lot of folks think that that is potentially a problem.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:15:28
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. You know, it's interesting, I think, for for physicians and people in the health care field, precautionary principles, is almost all the part of our DNA. Like, why wouldn't we just do that. And then you find for certain products, foods, but also things like makeup and things like that. They have these these different supply and production chains in Europe for some of these products versus the United States. So they were even in Canada where they won't they won't include certain ingredients in their foods. And so and I think the, the instinct, I think in the United States is often to say, well, that's why why are we doing this here? And that's terrible there, but it's more nuanced than that. I mean, you know, part of the reason, like even the Fruit Loops, that's come up a lot recently because of what RFK has been saying about that, I think people intuitively is like, yeah, why why are Fruit Loops have more chemicals than in Canada? And what the what the cereal manufacturers will say is, "look, we know, first of all, you're not telling us something we don't know." But also we've tried this and people didn't buy the products.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:16:27
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And and I guess that again, I don't know there's an answer to this, but but fundamentally, even if we learn all these things from Kevin Hall's study and all this. People like what they like. And they like the choice. And they're going to eat what they want to eat anyway, right? Even if they're informed by new labeling or whatever. How optimistic do you think he is? Or maybe even you are, that this will actually lead to to any kind of measurable change?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the cereal thing is super interesting, because if you have a situation where you're pressuring a company into removing something and that's all you're doing, you're just pressuring them, you're not requiring them to remove something, okay? They try it. Sales go down 10%. So they brought it back, you know, and sales bounced back okay. If you require them to do it they can't bring it back afterwards. So that's the question. It's like how are you going to deal with these things? Just pressuring companies. I mean I've covered the drug industry for a long time. They've dealt with a lot of pressure over their pricing practices. It works for a little, little while. They'll always find ways to raise prices again if they're allowed to. Yeah. I mean, so that's the question is regulation versus pressure. I asked Doctor Hall how optimistic he was that research like this would change anything about the way companies approach the food they make, because they want to sell more food. Of course they want to make it more delicious. They want you to eat more of it. And he was saying, well, you know, a soda company doesn't care whether it's selling you regular soda or diet soda. They don't care how many calories they're selling you because they can price side the same way. And so he sort of use that as analogy of maybe we can change these things. And, and also through behaviors, if you give people information maybe they can use that to, you know, make buying choices that influence what companies do.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:11
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, you know, one area that policy often goes, as you well know better than anybody is pricing. And the idea that some products would cost more than others, could, could be something that happens. And personally and I, I'm not an expert, but I think that's a dangerous slope because when you start to think about things like syntaxes, you know, I'm going to charge a tax for something that we now think is sinful in some way. I don't know, I feel like you're punishing people to buy calories.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Nicotine. I put in a different, different category because it really has no redeeming qualities. But food is food. And, you know, you'd rather people eat good, healthy, not super energy dense, calorie dense food. But again, you could feed your family for a five for 25 bucks, that's a pretty good deal. Are you going to put a tax on that and in a sense punish people for that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right. That would disproportionately hurt the people who already find food difficult to afford. So there is a huge issue with doing that. And I think that's part of a lot of pushback around all this focus on ultra processed foods. But that probably doesn't mean we shouldn't understand what processed foods do. It's just what do you do with that information? I think there is evidence to suggest with cigarettes, which of course are very different from food. You don't need them to live.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:23
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Exactly.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But they have found that taxing those is one of the most effective ways to discourage people from using cigarettes. With food, it's a different question, and I think some places are trying this. And, you know, of course, in New York City, Michael Bloomberg tried to put a tax on soda and it failed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I you know, I so I interviewed Michael Bloomberg as well about this. And it was it's actually one of the funniest interviews. First of all, he starts off even before we started rolling, he said, I just want to tell you, Sanjay, I love Cheetos. I know I never get that. And I'm like, oh, that's very interesting, Mr. Mayor. Like, you love Cheetos. Things like, why leave the interview with me?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It was a skeleton in his closet. That he needed to put out there.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:01
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I just want to get this out of the way. I'm a Cheeto lover. But he had this thing. Obviously, part of it was pricing. But the other part was that if you went to a movie theater, you could no longer buy a 16 ounce sofda, you could buy an eight ounce. And if you wanted, you could buy two, eight ounce sodas. So then you could have your 16oz, but you couldn't buy a 16 ounce in one glass. And I said tell me about that. And he was making this point that I'm adding these micro blocks. This is part policy. But part of this is just psychology. I'm just saying I'm going to make it. Even if it's not more expensive. It's just slightly more difficult for people. And there might be enough people out there who say, hey, eight ounce is enough. I'll just, you know, take that as a micro block.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And then something with soda. I mean, that's not necessarily in the same category as a meal. So worrying about the, the tax on on folks who are for...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So are, you know, in terms of takeaways for people like I, you know, I've often been told read the ingredients. If you can't pronounce some of the ingredients, probably not a good thing to buy. Is that kind of how you just simply approach things when you go grocery shopping?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes. But after learning more about this and talking more with Kevin Hall, I. I suspect it's more nuanced than that. And I also, I'm giving myself a little bit of a break as a parent of young kids who love goldfish crackers.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They have a lot of ingredients you can't pronounce in the goldfish cracker.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Cracker, including, I think smiles are, an ingredient in goldfish crackers listed in the ingredients list. I definitely I mean, I guess I can make those in my own kitchen, so there we go.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Do they really have that listed in the ingredients?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So I haven't totally changed the way, but I do, I do think about it more for sure.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:45
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But this whole thing about not being able to pronounce and we're going to look at some of these products here in a second. But if you can't buy it yourself, the ingredient in the food that you're about to eat. From what I've seen, from what you've reported in the past, that that's a red flag.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. If you're trying to avoid ultra processed foods, it's a red flag.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:22:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And people should avoid ultra processed foods. I guess we're coming right back to the beginning of this discussion again. So should I, based on everything you know, it sounds like a good idea to avoid ultra processed foods. They might be too hyper palatable. They might make me eat too much, even unknowingly. And they have all these ingredients that some of. We don't know what they do, but just in terms of precautionary principle might be a good thing to avoid.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, if you can. I think it's a good I mean, I'm not a doctor. You are. You can say that, but.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:22:31
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, again, some of this, to be to be fair to, is we don't have a lot of data to show whether or not some of these ingredients are necessarily bad for people. But if you're if you're trying to apply this precautionary principle and anyone who's listening should maybe think about this a little bit and maybe even look it up and think about how you want to live your life in terms of precautionary principle, there's a lot of things that we do in our lives to avoid something. It's not that it's necessarily going to be a harm to us, but hey, I'd rather not take the chance. But when it comes to some of these ingredients, I don't know. I'm just listening to you. And I don't know that it makes a difference. And I'm a doctor because again, we don't have data on a lot of these things. But I think precautionary principle is pretty sound when it comes to some ingredients that I can't pronounce.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. The way I think about it is like, if I'm in the grocery store and I've got two loaves of bread in front of me and I can look at the ingredients, I'm going to choose the one with the ingredients I recognize all else being equal. If that cost twice as much. Maybe I'll think about it a little more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:23:32
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This I mean, this this fundamentally is probably what's going to drive the policy discussion, because I think you're absolutely right. If it cost twice as much. People may choose with their with their wallet more so than their precautionary principle. You know, and that'll be a really interesting discussion to have going forward. Maybe we can talk about that in a future podcast.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. We'll see what happens.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:23:52
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Just what's the timetable on any of this? So the studies are ongoing. How long will they take to complete and have real results? And then what? What happens next?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So Kevin Hall's current study, he expects to be done by the middle of 2025. And to have results, he hopes, at least in a pre-print -- so not peer reviewed, published in a journal necessarily -- but to have the results out there in the world by the end of 2025 or early 2026. So these things take a long time. This is slow. And there's not a lot of it going on, and there's a lot of demand for change even before we get these data sets. And already, you know, the USDA Dietary Guidelines Committee is meeting to talk about what's going to go in 2025 to 2030s dietary guidelines. And these won't necessarily change huge amounts of things, but they are important. And they're not they're not considering ultra processed foods. Really. Because they think there's not enough evidence to to help them make decisions about it for this upcoming set. So we're talking about 2030 for that. But whether there could be actions that take place sooner than that. And how much science they're based on and, you know, we're going to have to see and I think industry will push back based on what they say is a lack of evidence.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:25:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And I mean, I think this idea of what, what level of evidence is necessary in order to implement policy change is a question that comes up, not just in health care, but I think in many aspects of our society a lot. And and how cautious we want to be. It'll be interesting to see how it all plays out. I'm fascinated by it. But, you know, I'm a doctor. I think that, 70% roughly of chronic disease in this country is preventable. This is according to studies that I've read and reporting I've done over 20 years. And I think a lot of that is in some way, shape or form based on how we nourish ourselves. Food is the only signal that we consciously give from our outside world to our inside world on a daily basis. We're informing our inside world with with our food. You know, I just think we should be really thoughtful about it based on the best evidence. But as you said at the beginning of this podcast, that evidence is really hard to collect. These aren't the 10,000, you know, huge clinically controlled trials that people would like. And I think what regulators probably need to understand is we may never have that kind of data. So how do you act in the meantime? That's going to be a really good question. So you have a bag of...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, I brought you treats! Okay. So I asked Ben Tinker, the head of health, and Sanjay, longtime producer. What Sanjay's favorite treat is. Do you know what it is?

              All right. Do you have reading glasses? I can't even I can't even read this anymore.

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Okay, so, here are the ingredients. Okay. Cream, skim milk, liquid sugar, which is sugar and water. Water. Wheat flour. It's probably the cookie dough we're talking about here.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              Yeah.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Sugar. Brown sugar, egg yolks. Butter, which is cream and salt. Expeller pressed soybean oil. Eggs. Coconut oil. Chocolate liqueur. Cocoa, processed with alkali. Cocoa, molasses, guar gum, salt, vanilla extract, natural flavor, cocoa butter, invert sugar, carrageenan, milk fat, tapioca flour, soy lecithin, annatto extract for color, turmeric extract for color, and milk.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I got to tell you, in some ways I. That's a lot. But I thought I was going to be worse. I thought there's gonna be a lot of things in there that we're going to be these multi, multi syllabic words that I couldn't possibly pronounce. What do you think when you read that list?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a lot of ingredients. I mean probably to explain the chocolate chip cookie dough. Maybe I should have gotten just vanilla so we could compare. But something like carrageenan.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              Yeah. What is?

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I don't know. I think it's some kind of maybe gum. I'm not really sure what that is. Or. And I certainly have never used it in my own kitchen.

              'Okay, so this is I had to really scour the shelves, which is why I was a little bit late coming in here this morning to try to find an ice cream that was not ultra processed. Let's see, where is the ingredient list? It's so small, I can't find it. Okay. Ingredients. Milk. Cane. Sugar. Cream. Cocoa powder. Processed with alkali. I don't know what that is. Tapioca syrup. Nonfat milk. That was the closest thing I could find to non-ultra processed. I don't know what the alkali thing is, so maybe that's still ultra processed. Here's the thing about these two, though. Does that make this one more healthy than that one?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right.

              Kevin Hall doesn't think so. His hypothesis is that you're going to this is so hyper palatable. This is so energy dense. Even if it's minimally processed, it is going to drive you to eat to the same degree that the ultra processed ice cream is going to drive you to overeat. That's what his study is trying to figure out.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's really interesting. I think I think that's a it's a it's a great point to sort of leave things on that at the same time that, we may have these preconceived notions of just how, how problematic ultra processed foods are. Maybe there are other foods that may not be as processed that still have that, that really high energy density, that hyper palatability, that are still going to really make you eat. And kind of knowing yourself in this regard probably is maybe the most important thing. But a pleasure always, I always enjoyed, enjoy talking to you.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak in West Texas is continuing to spread. And with kindergarten vaccination rates dipping across the country, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/1198913177/measles-cases-are-up-and-childhood-vaccinations-are-down" target="_blank"&gt;more communities may be at risk of outbreaks.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's not just kids who should be vaccinated. Infectious disease experts say some adults may need to get revaccinated, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles can spread incredibly fast — it's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;one of the world's most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, more than flu, polio, Covid, or just about any other infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit,&lt;/a&gt; director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, notes that just last week, West Texas was reporting 14 cases. This week, it's up to 58 cases. "It's very hard to control measles," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The best defense against measles is vaccination. The vast majority of people getting sick in Texas are unvaccinated. And the measles vaccine is both safe and highly effective, says &lt;a href="https://wag.app.vanderbilt.edu/PublicPage/Faculty/Details/27990" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you have been vaccinated with two doses of vaccine as per routine, you have a 95-plus percent chance of being completely protected throughout your life," Schaffner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But public health experts say there are some adults who should consider getting revaccinated. That includes older adults who were born after 1957 and were vaccinated before 1968. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because early versions of the measles vaccine were made from an inactivated (killed) virus, which didn't work particularly well, Offit says. That's why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends that anyone vaccinated before 1968&lt;/a&gt; get at least one dose of the live attenuated vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, nearly everyone got the disease during childhood. So people born before 1957 are assumed to have natural immunity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schaffner says if you're not sure of your immunity or vaccination status, there's no harm in getting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you were vaccinated between 1968 and 1989, you likely received just one dose of the measles vaccine, instead of the two doses that are standard today. One dose alone is highly effective and for most people, it provides more than enough protection, says Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/1232304335/booster-shots-measles" target="_blank"&gt;author of &lt;em&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/em&gt;, a book on the history of measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But Ratner says there are several situations in which the CDC recommends an additional dose of measles vaccine for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;adults who are considered at high risk&lt;/a&gt;. That includes people who are in college settings, work in health care, live or are in close contact with immunocompromised people, or are travelling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you're traveling somewhere where there's an active outbreak and you're not sure that you got two doses, it may not be crazy to get a second dose," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if you live in a community which is experiencing a measles outbreak, your local or state health department may recommend a second dose for adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's worthwhile to make sure you're protected, because adults over 20 are more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby." target="_blank"&gt;complications from measles&lt;/a&gt;, which can include pneumonia and brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780576486/samoa-closes-schools-and-mandates-vaccinations-amid-deadly-measles-epidemic" target="_blank"&gt;can also be dangerous — if not deadly — for children.&lt;/a&gt; As many as 1 in 20 kids with measles will get pneumonia, and 1 out of 1,000 will develop encephalitis, or brain swelling — which can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby." target="_blank"&gt;lead to death or cause deafness or intellectual disabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, kindergarten vaccination rates have fallen below the 95% threshold that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is needed to prevent community outbreaks. In some parts of the U.S., rates are far lower. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/g-s1-49648/up-first-newsletter-measles-west-texas-jair-bolsonaro-china-funding" target="_blank"&gt;That includes Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, the epicenter of the state's outbreak, where the vaccination rate is only at about 80%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Offit says vaccination is the best way to protect children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I lived through the 1991 Philadelphia measles epidemic, where there were 1,400 cases and nine deaths over a period of three months," he says. "So I've seen children suffer needlessly because of the choice not to get a vaccine. So please, vaccinate your children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      
      Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified &lt;i&gt;FAM171A2&lt;/i&gt; as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with &amp;gt;1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2-α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice. Our findings identified FAM171A2 as a potential receptor for the neuronal uptake of α-syn fibrils and, thus, as a therapeutic target against PD.

&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question for both farmers and government officials is how the virus gets onto farms in the first place. Some transmission routes—such as direct contact with wild birds, contaminated feed or drinking water, and movement by people through contaminated clothing or equipment—are well-documented, and biosecurity measures are taken at many farms to minimize exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, new research sheds light on an often-overlooked mechanism: windborne transmission. A &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1" aria-label="recent study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1"&gt;recent study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents compelling genetic and meteorological evidence that H5N1 can travel significant distances via wind, challenging the conventional wisdom and highlighting the need to reconsider outbreak mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Screen shot from USDA APHIS website, February 20, 2025. &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Evidence for an Epidemiological Link&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted after an outbreak of H5N1 in the Czech Republic in February 2024, examined how the virus spread from a duck farm to two chicken farms located approximately 8 km away. Genetic sequencing revealed striking similarities between the virus strains at these farms, with some isolates from the duck farm 100% identical to those found in the chicken farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, extensive field investigations ruled out several possible transmission routes. There were no direct interactions between the companies managing the farms, no contaminated feed or water sources, and no major water bodies nearby to facilitate spread via wild birds. The study also ruled out human-associated transmission and even rodent-mediated spread. Given these findings, wind emerged as the most plausible explanation for how the virus traveled between the farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meteorological Correlation and Windborne Spread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteorological data provided further support for the windborne transmission hypothesis. Between February 4 and 7, prevailing winds blew consistently from the west or southwest (250–300 degrees), aligning with the suspected transmission route. Wind speeds averaged around 4 meters per second, with gusts reaching 8–10 meters per second on February 5. The study determined the optimal period for airborne viral transmission occurred from noon on February 4 to midnight on February 5. At these wind speeds, the virus could have made the distance between the two farms in just 13-22 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Airborne transmission, especially over distances of 8 km, is not typically considered a major route for H5N1 transmission. However, this study challenges that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-2" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Map showing duck farm and chicken farms connected by windborne spread of H5N1 avian influenza. Map &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; drawn by E. Marty from data reported in a study of an outbreak in the Czech Republic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eric Marty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Tunnel Ventilation Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant insights from the study is the role of tunnel ventilation systems in facilitating windborne spread. These ventilation systems function like high-volume air samplers, creating negative pressure inside poultry houses that draws in huge quantities of ambient air effectively concentrating whatever particulates may be in that air, in this case infectious virions of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the infection period, ventilation rates at the affected chicken farms were exceptionally high. These conditions likely allowed airborne viral particles to accumulate and reach infectious doses. Notably, on the affected chicken farms, outbreaks in chicken houses began near air intake systems. On farm C, the researchers inferred that transmission between chicken houses likely originated in the house with the largest bird population and highest ventilation rate, making it the most plausible first recipient of airborne virus from farm B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for Outbreak Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study have significant implications for HPAI outbreak response and biosecurity measures. Conventionally, only dust generated during depopulation efforts has been considered a major risk factor for airborne transmission. However, this study suggests that aerosols produced by infected flocks may be more significant carriers of the virus, as heavier dust particles tend to settle quickly near the outbreak site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this new understanding of transmission dynamics, poultry farms and animal health officials should consider whether or not existing biosecurity protocols that focus on direct contact and contamination are adequate. Should airborne mitigation strategies now be considered, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, more research is needed to determine if poultry houses with tunnel ventilation systems need additional filtration or air purification technologies to minimize airborne virus spread, especially in places where chicken farms are located close to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study provides strong genetic and meteorological evidence for windborne transmission in this case, there are limitations to air sampling studies. Detecting minute concentrations of viral particles over long distances is challenging. The absence of detection in some studies does not necessarily rule out windborne spread, highlighting the need for continued research into the aerodynamics of viral transmission in poultry settings. In the meantime it’s worth reconsidering if airborne transmission might account for some of the incursions into otherwise biosecured facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reshapes our understanding of H5N1 transmission, presenting robust evidence that windborne spread plays a larger role than previously recognized. By highlighting the role of tunnel ventilation systems and optimal wind conditions, the research underscores the need for enhanced airborne transmission control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When you've eaten a good meal at a restaurant and the waiter asks, "Got any room for dessert?" where does the voice that craves a gratuitous slice of pie come from? &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your brain. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists now have a better understanding of the neural origins of this urge thanks to a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1510"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mice brains are structurally similar to human brains. So, to isolate the neural pathways responsible for "dessert brain," the researchers turned to mice. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research fed mice to the point of fullness and then gave them sugar. In doing so, they found that the same neurons signaling satiety, or fullness, also released β-Endorphin, a naturally-occurring opiate. This chemical bound to opiate receptors in the mice brains and triggered a feeling of reward. When the team then blocked this opiate pathway, the mice stayed away from the sugar. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The researchers found the same neural mechanism in humans when studying donated brain tissue and scanning the brains of volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cecad.uni-koeln.de/research/principal-investigators/full-members/henning-fenselau"&gt;Henning Fenselau&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study authors, says this suggests that people's brains evolved to love sugar in excess. "Because sugar is so easy to metabolize, its consumption beyond energy needs is favorable for animals," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the team hopes this research can lead to a better understanding of sugar overconsumption, obesity and more sophisticated weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want us to cover more neuroscience on the show?

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress' (for example, it's not clear how common the condition is) but they highlighted a need for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers believes she has the syndrome. She was at peak physical performance when she received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months later, she was reliant on a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed the symptoms as anxiety and prescribed antidepressants, but Mrs Ayers told DailyMail.com  her condition soon started 'rapidly declining.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her regular 10-mile runs and 20-mile bike rides quickly dwindled, and she suffered muscle tears, including in her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During an art class, Mrs Ayers passed out. She said: 'I couldn't see. I couldn't hear. I've been in a wheelchair ever since.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a year and a half, doctors assumed she had long Covid due to elevated levels of spike proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine.

They would say stuff like "You could die in seven months, or you could live the rest of your life like this. We don't know what's going to happen to you. We don't know what's wrong with you."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers spent another eight months bedbound and unable to speak, and her husband, who is also a Coast Guard veteran, had to take leave to care for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I get these crashes where if I try to take care of myself, my body shuts down and I'm in so much pain. I can't even lift my arms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Ayers has seen slight improvements, such as being able to sit up, she worries about being taken seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not an anti-vaccine person. I think vaccines help people, but I think this specific vaccine hurt a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It'd be cool if more people understood that it can hurt people so that more doctors will research and they'll have a cure for what I'm going through.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the injury, the father-of-two (pictured here with his family) has been forced to cut back his hours as a researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erica Evers, a 42-year-old former legal compliance worker from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-c06b7ef0-efc9-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, was reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine when her employers mandated it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she told DailyMail.com she would have risked losing her job and her health insurance, which she needed to pay for treatment for her son's chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had to choose between his life and my own. It's not a choice when you're a mother.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day after her first dose, Mrs Evers developed blurry vision in her right eye, and she couldn't see anything directly in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was absolutely terrifying. I felt very unsafe,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This worsened after her second dose, leading Mrs Evers to seek out an eye doctor specializing in the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that helps the brain interpret light signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor diagnosed Mrs Evers with a retinal hemorrhage, or bleeding at the back of the eye, which is treated with monthly injections in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around the same time, she developed tinnitus, a persistent ringing in the ears, which caused hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRI scans showed Mrs Evers had swelling in her brain, which has been shown to cause vision and hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors told her all three issues were likely unrelated and didn't explain what may have caused them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept asking them if it was the vaccine, and the big hospitals kept saying, "No, absolutely not. The shots are safe and effective." They couldn't diagnose what was happening to me. '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Erica Evers, 42, suffered blurry vision and bleeding behind the eye after her vaccine. She is seen at left before the injury and at right during a hemorrhage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers told DailyMail.com she worries her vision will become so bad she won't be able to see her three sons (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Evers now has to get injections in her eye every month to stop the hemorrhaging, which can cost more than $2,000 per dose, and her vision fluctuates throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website she worries one day she will wake up and not be able to see her three sons: 'This has just robbed me of my life with them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her condition has never officially been linked to the vaccine, but she hopes the new research will boost her chances of getting closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kameron Snowden, a 57-year-old service technician from Indiana, received his first Covid vaccine in 2021 to support his wife, a healthcare worker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'I was never a skeptic. For the sake of my wife's career, it was something I was willing to do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-one almost immediately felt as if he gained 'Spidey Senses' after his second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Snowden said: 'Lights were brighter. I could hear things across the room that I normally couldn't hear. Everything was more vivid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, he developed 'frequencies' in his ear, which he compares to fax machine sounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed Mr Snowden's symptoms until 2023, when he suddenly developed an irregular heartbeat that made him feel like he was having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers also has non-cancerous but unexplained lesions on her brain, which she believes are from the vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers, pictured here, said: 'We're just left here to rot. We can't get disability because you can't get doctors to confirm that you're disabled by the vaccine. There's no help available. We're just left here to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I can't bend down and stand up without feeling like I'm losing a grip on consciousness. It literally feels like sometimes my brain is being starved of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can't walk up and down stairs without actually grabbing onto the banister because at any time I might get a dizzy spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just never know what's going to happen. I'm scared to be left home alone. You just resign yourself to the fact that your days are numbered.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dr Keyer's case, the Minnesota professor received his Moderna shot in 2021 and he says it triggered a cascade of health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He battled with extreme fatigue and weakness for a year. In March 2022, Dr Keyler developed blood clots in his right kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July 2022, doctors diagnosed Dr Keyler with rhabdomyolysis - a breakdown of muscle tissue that causes the release of a protein called myoglobin, which gets filtered through the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can break down kidney cells and damage the organs. In half of rhabdomyolysis cases, people experience kidney complications similar to Dr Keyler's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor also developed cataracts - a condition that normally affects elderly people but can also develop due to kidney damage. Studies have shown a significant association between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keyler told this website: 'I couldn't stand for more than 20 minutes at a time without being completely exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I ended up taking a partial leave from work, and then it was just other things kept popping up, like my vision started to deteriorate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers, pictured here, told this website she wishes vaccines were treated like 'any other medicine' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a search for answers, Dr Keyler approached a specialist at Mayo Clinic who could not find an answer to the professor's ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the Mayo Clinic believe the multiple conditions Dr Keyler was suffering from were due to post-Covid syndrome, but he believes it was due to his Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked if there is anything he wish for doctors across the country to know about his experience, he said: 'In general, they need to believe what their patients are saying and when they don't know, not come up with something completely wild out in left field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was misdiagnosed with so many things along the way and some of them were pretty serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think they realize it now, but just how debilitating [the experience] can be, and for people to try to even seek help when they're feeling like that is, I know it was very difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxPYjhLb1d2YktNV2sybTdSQmxYQlZoZ1pQLUhhVzNHYTJIZjlfWUVjTUsyM1JPZWVZSVJocXlOeGxZamtVUncwang1YmZncFZ5VmlvaWJTa291SGZQaVlzY3REb19BTDF2Q0RBX2R2VEtXYWFfQ3NuS0kzdG9yeWhIVnR2NWV4ZUZ1RzhrNUNiMWhBbFdaWFRlaTNFTzRXelphTU12RVFDNjVUdzd6cFNJV19NeFVYZTJCVzdBd1l3UElNYXJIWWQ1Y3ZWS1BHMDFudHZiNllWS1lNcWRZQ0RKdHliTmFlSi1CeWhJMnRtSjFwM01TWWfSAfsBQVVfeXFMUFYxVzFEcmlqR2c0di03UXVPYlI5dE5SVjFWRmRIV1hQTUtjVzlBU3FKOHZ0QkN6UzVaXzNXVHVRcm1IbXo4aW1IT1J6cTJDcFhBY2RJV1A2WFFhdjVOR3c5UUtadUF5VEg5QUsyNW5KZFZsc1Y3V1BpV1JpNUdQX0ZoZEhHeWxPNDAzNHpRLXd5dW9lT1FiNjNqN1BQNGdHLVhEUFFYOXJxY1d2VW1URzFCa0s3RE5YRHlSOWFpN1k2RUlDc2NtMkFtVFNZdFBRWDBRRTh1ODhReUNrVnZ5cVlHTF9hbTJJdVdqNDdGTnNqTjR4SGdsa2huQkU</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine victims left disabled after taking Covid jab react to bombshell Yale study that found shots cause extr - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9gFBVV95cUxPYjhLb1d2YktNV2sybTdSQmxYQlZoZ1pQLUhhVzNHYTJIZjlfWUVjTUsyM1JPZWVZSVJocXlOeGxZamtVUncwang1YmZncFZ5VmlvaWJTa291SGZQaVlzY3REb19BTDF2Q0RBX2R2VEtXYWFfQ3NuS0kzdG9yeWhIVnR2NWV4ZUZ1RzhrNUNiMWhBbFdaWFRlaTNFTzRXelphTU12RVFDNjVUdzd6cFNJV19NeFVYZTJCVzdBd1l3UElNYXJIWWQ1Y3ZWS1BHMDFudHZiNllWS1lNcWRZQ0RKdHliTmFlSi1CeWhJMnRtSjFwM01TWWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a new Yale University study identified a debilitating syndrome linked to Covid vaccines, Lindy Ayers breathed a sigh of relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 31-year-old Army veteran, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arkansas/index.html" id="mol-9e389f20-efd8-11ef-af33-b359746a4595" class=""&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, has been wheelchair-bound since she took her second Pfizer shot in 2021 as part of the government's military mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years she was told her extreme fatigue, sickness and heart palpitations were anxiety.

I think vaccines help people, but I think this specific vaccine hurt a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It'd be cool if more people understood that it can hurt people so that more doctors will research and they'll have a cure for what I'm going through.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the injury, the father-of-two (pictured here with his family) has been forced to cut back his hours as a researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erica Evers, a 42-year-old former legal compliance worker from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-c06b7ef0-efc9-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, was reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine when her employers mandated it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she told DailyMail.com she would have risked losing her job and her health insurance, which she needed to pay for treatment for her son's chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had to choose between his life and my own. It's not a choice when you're a mother.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day after her first dose, Mrs Evers developed blurry vision in her right eye, and she couldn't see anything directly in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was absolutely terrifying. I felt very unsafe,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This worsened after her second dose, leading Mrs Evers to seek out an eye doctor specializing in the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that helps the brain interpret light signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor diagnosed Mrs Evers with a retinal hemorrhage, or bleeding at the back of the eye, which is treated with monthly injections in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around the same time, she developed tinnitus, a persistent ringing in the ears, which caused hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRI scans showed Mrs Evers had swelling in her brain, which has been shown to cause vision and hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors told her all three issues were likely unrelated and didn't explain what may have caused them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept asking them if it was the vaccine, and the big hospitals kept saying, "No, absolutely not. The shots are safe and effective." They couldn't diagnose what was happening to me. '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Erica Evers, 42, suffered blurry vision and bleeding behind the eye after her vaccine. She is seen at left before the injury and at right during a hemorrhage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers told DailyMail.com she worries her vision will become so bad she won't be able to see her three sons (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Evers now has to get injections in her eye every month to stop the hemorrhaging, which can cost more than $2,000 per dose, and her vision fluctuates throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website she worries one day she will wake up and not be able to see her three sons: 'This has just robbed me of my life with them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her condition has never officially been linked to the vaccine, but she hopes the new research will boost her chances of getting closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kameron Snowden, a 57-year-old service technician from Indiana, received his first Covid vaccine in 2021 to support his wife, a healthcare worker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'I was never a skeptic. For the sake of my wife's career, it was something I was willing to do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-one almost immediately felt as if he gained 'Spidey Senses' after his second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Snowden said: 'Lights were brighter. I could hear things across the room that I normally couldn't hear. Everything was more vivid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, he developed 'frequencies' in his ear, which he compares to fax machine sounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed Mr Snowden's symptoms until 2023, when he suddenly developed an irregular heartbeat that made him feel like he was having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers also has non-cancerous but unexplained lesions on her brain, which she believes are from the vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers, pictured here, said: 'We're just left here to rot. We can't get disability because you can't get doctors to confirm that you're disabled by the vaccine. There's no help available. We're just left here to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I can't bend down and stand up without feeling like I'm losing a grip on consciousness. It literally feels like sometimes my brain is being starved of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can't walk up and down stairs without actually grabbing onto the banister because at any time I might get a dizzy spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just never know what's going to happen. I'm scared to be left home alone. You just resign yourself to the fact that your days are numbered.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dr Keyer's case, the Minnesota professor received his Moderna shot in 2021 and he says it triggered a cascade of health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He battled with extreme fatigue and weakness for a year. In March 2022, Dr Keyler developed blood clots in his right kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July 2022, doctors diagnosed Dr Keyler with rhabdomyolysis - a breakdown of muscle tissue that causes the release of a protein called myoglobin, which gets filtered through the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can break down kidney cells and damage the organs. In half of rhabdomyolysis cases, people experience kidney complications similar to Dr Keyler's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor also developed cataracts - a condition that normally affects elderly people but can also develop due to kidney damage. Studies have shown a significant association between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keyler told this website: 'I couldn't stand for more than 20 minutes at a time without being completely exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I ended up taking a partial leave from work, and then it was just other things kept popping up, like my vision started to deteriorate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers, pictured here, told this website she wishes vaccines were treated like 'any other medicine' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a search for answers, Dr Keyler approached a specialist at Mayo Clinic who could not find an answer to the professor's ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the Mayo Clinic believe the multiple conditions Dr Keyler was suffering from were due to post-Covid syndrome, but he believes it was due to his Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked if there is anything he wish for doctors across the country to know about his experience, he said: 'In general, they need to believe what their patients are saying and when they don't know, not come up with something completely wild out in left field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was misdiagnosed with so many things along the way and some of them were pretty serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think they realize it now, but just how debilitating [the experience] can be, and for people to try to even seek help when they're feeling like that is, I know it was very difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxPYjhLb1d2YktNV2sybTdSQmxYQlZoZ1pQLUhhVzNHYTJIZjlfWUVjTUsyM1JPZWVZSVJocXlOeGxZamtVUncwang1YmZncFZ5VmlvaWJTa291SGZQaVlzY3REb19BTDF2Q0RBX2R2VEtXYWFfQ3NuS0kzdG9yeWhIVnR2NWV4ZUZ1RzhrNUNiMWhBbFdaWFRlaTNFTzRXelphTU12RVFDNjVUdzd6cFNJV19NeFVYZTJCVzdBd1l3UElNYXJIWWQ1Y3ZWS1BHMDFudHZiNllWS1lNcWRZQ0RKdHliTmFlSi1CeWhJMnRtSjFwM01TWWc</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu's potential threat to humans: Tower Health doctor describes risk level - 69News WFMZ-TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9wFBVV95cUxObWJWT0VieHhsTmV1TlZ1Q2JQYlJ5a1JmNzJlanFCc0s4Tjg3bUM3N0dmMERqY19QRGcwZ1pjZW5IcjdnTkxIRkZ0V3lGa3BvalVVVkF3QkdIY0hjamVyR2praE55dnNuczQ3eXZJbWNpNkV2OFdFNTRmcFMwUXFsOTIzX3g3QXpIRXRpZXhjcEJxYktLN2xBanUtX2JOYVlpRFVYSlVqVE4wY3kwbjNKUHAzZ3RILU5SMlZrLTNObzl0YVZCVmZFYTM0S2g4VWJvVHVzVVJ0Zlgxa21FZmF6Y2dsVzZqLVZ4QkZTZ1J5T01YZlN5Vy1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;BERKS COUNTY, Pa. – Bird flu, also known as avian flu, is wreaking havoc on the poultry population and the price of eggs. As of now, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the threat of a public health risk remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we're not seeing any in Pennsylvania," said Dr. Grace Kim, an infectious disease specialist with Tower Health. "As of yesterday, there were 68 human cases, and there are 69 so far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said of the 69 people, most have had mild symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The avian flu is just like any mild flu, so you can have the runny nose, sore throat, cough, but what's different is the irritation of the eye," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim said the people most at risk of contracting the virus are those who work closely with farm animals. She said, so far, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human spread. But she said said scientists are watching closely to make sure the virus doesn't mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where the concern is, where if that should happen, in that it can turn into an outbreak," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the best way to contain the virus is to try to minimize the spread among animals and protect yourself if you do work closely with farm animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Use proper protective equipment, whether they use an N95 or a mask if they have one available," she said. "If they're in the farm industry, the employee should be providing proper equipment for them to take care of farm animals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Kim said people should be more worried about another flu: influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, using this avian flu as a soap box for the seasonal flu, which is horrible," she said. "And the rates, even as they are trending down this week, we are still higher than what our worst was last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The body is able to absorb nutrients from food better than supplements, so I always recommend starting with foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamins can fill the gaps if you don’t eat enough plant-based foods with vitamin C, but “mega-doses” of the nutrient won’t prevent most people from getting sick, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, people who already have a vitamin C deficiency may lower their risk of getting a cold by getting plenty of the nutrient, registered dietitian Carol Johnston, Ph.D., who is an expert on vitamin C metabolism, previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The powerful antioxidant also protects cells from damage and is important for healthy skin, bones, teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 90 milligrams for men and 75 milligrams for women, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Children need less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safe upper limit is 2,000 milligrams a day, though the nutrient doesn’t cause serious problems even at high doses, the NIH notes. The body flushes out excess vitamin C in urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrus is famous for vitamin C, but other fruits deliver even more of the nutrient. Here are nine fruits highest in vitamin C:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell peppers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 yellow bell pepper, 342 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 red bell pepper, 210 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 green bell pepper, 132 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise! You may think of them as vegetables, but bell peppers are officially classified as fruits and they are vitamin C superstars, especially the yellow kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red bell peppers are one of Rizzo’s favorite &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-snack-boost-immune-system-rcna182453" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:snacks to boost the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;snacks to boost the immune system&lt;/a&gt; during cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re naturally low in calories and fat and provide fiber. In addition to vitamin C, they contain vitamin A, B vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorful, sweet and crunchy, they can be sliced and then dipped in hummus or tzatziki for a filling snack, Rizzo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guava&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet tropical fruit contains almost double the amount of vitamin C found in an orange, plus &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/guava-benefits-rcna173418" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guava;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guava&lt;/a&gt; is very high in antioxidants, potassium and fiber.

It also contains a bit of iron and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pineapple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians are impressed by &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/pineapple-benefits-rcna152025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pineapple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pineapple&lt;/a&gt;’s high vitamin C content, especially since it helps the body absorb plant sources of iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So as people are transitioning to more of a plant-based way of eating, sometimes having extra vitamin C can help your body absorb iron from foods like spinach or beans to make sure you’re not deficient in iron,” Sarah Rivenburgh, a registered dietitian at OhioHealth, previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pineapple also contains insoluble fiber, or roughage, which helps to keep the bowels moving regularly; and bromelain, an enzyme that breaks down proteins and has anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 medium orange, 68 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;½ grapefruit, 45 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 small tangerines, 40 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/calories-in-an-orange-rcna57154" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oranges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Oranges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/grapefruit-benefits-rcna186537" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grapefruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;grapefruits&lt;/a&gt; and tangerines are a go-to source of vitamin C for many people.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18072"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18073"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18074"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths.

But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQY0RBMElfMWwyb28yRVQ0N2c2X1htNy1Ha3FvUXJld05ESU1GUFR6X1RybmlnMi1UZjF1UGh2YUlvQ3V3RmtYN1lnZGZpVnBpemNYVXNHc0pXZnc1TXQwdWxDZE4yQmh4alpfTC1yTTI1XzMyX2h3eHJBTE9NcHAyQ21KLTRNemlHTkgtYXBNcUMwUkp4czh0eFNNejkwd1VYWVFPMWpB</guid></item><item><title>US doctor explains how just 10 minutes of walking can increase life span - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has a deep impact on the overall well being including the longevity of an individual. Several studies have suggested the importance of daily movement for as small as just a few minutes in controlling the important parameters of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Cleveland Clinic's Senior Medical Advisor, Mark Hyman took to Instagram to share the findings of two important studies and to aware his fans and followers about the importance of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing the highlights of the study, the expert writes, "A study published in The Lancet followed 47,000 people over seven years and found that walking can significantly lower the risk of death. For adults 60 and older, the greatest benefits were seen at 6,000 to 8,000 steps per day. For adults under 60, the sweet spot was 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day. Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity. Start where you are and build from there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark’s post has received positive feedback from his followers. "Love this reminder! Every step adds up to a healthier, longer life. Time to lace up and get moving! Who’s in?," writes one user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Could not be agreed more! My homework to the couples is to take a short walk at least for 10 min around the block whenever you feel out of control. It is so important to remind ourselves we are humans and we are not perfect. Getting angry, triggered, and misunderstood by everyone there specifically our partner is part of life. But how we choose to respond to our own triggers and emotions is the key to have a more blanched and more satisfying life. As a couple and relationship therapist I always emphasize the importance of pause, process and precede. Taking few minutes walk not only help out with physical health but also calm our nervous system down so was can come back with clarity and calm to our partner," writes a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power walking is a faster-paced form of walking that offers enhanced health benefits compared to regular walking. By maintaining a speed of 4 to 5.5 mph, power walking boosts cardiovascular fitness, burns more calories, and strengthens muscles. It improves posture, engages the core, and enhances endurance without the impact of running. This low-impact exercise reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and joint issues while promoting weight loss and mental well-being. Incorporating arm movements and proper posture maximizes its benefits. Power walking is an effective and accessible way to improve overall health and maintain an active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does walking help boost health?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of exercise. It requires no special equipment, can be done anywhere, and offers numerous health benefits. Whether it’s a brisk morning walk or a relaxed evening stroll, walking consistently can greatly enhance physical and mental well-being. Studies have shown that regular walkers tend to live longer and healthier lives. Walking reduces the risk of chronic diseases, improves mobility, and enhances overall quality of life, making it a key factor in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking strengthens the heart by improving circulation, reducing bad cholesterol (LDL), and increasing good cholesterol (HDL). Regular walking lowers the risk of heart diseases, high blood pressure, and stroke. Just 30 minutes a day can significantly improve heart health and boost overall endurance. For individuals with diabetes or those at risk, walking helps regulate blood sugar levels. A short walk after meals can enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar spikes, making it an excellent habit for diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is an effective way to burn calories and maintain a healthy weight. A brisk 30-minute walk can burn between 150-200 calories, depending on body weight and speed. It also helps in improving metabolism, making it easier to manage weight without the stress of intense workouts. It engages various muscles, including the legs, core, and back. It helps maintain bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, especially in nature, reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. It stimulates the release of endorphins, the body’s natural mood boosters. Walking in fresh air and green surroundings can also improve concentration, creativity, and overall mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking stimulates the immune system, helping the body fight infections. Studies suggest that people who walk regularly have a lower risk of colds, flu, and other illnesses. Walking enhances circulation, which allows immune cells to move more efficiently throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular walking can improve sleep quality by reducing stress and balancing circadian rhythms. It helps in managing insomnia and contributes to more restful and uninterrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A post-meal walk aids digestion by enhancing gut motility and reducing bloating. Walking after meals can also help prevent acid reflux and promote overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR</guid></item><item><title>8 daily exercises to reduce cholesterol levels naturally and detox our body - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise plays a vital role in managing cholesterol by increasing HDL (good cholesterol) and lowering LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming, helps improve heart health by promoting better blood circulation and reducing plaque buildup in arteries. Strength training also contributes to overall metabolic health. Exercise aids in weight management, reducing the risk of obesity-related high cholesterol. It enhances insulin sensitivity, lowering the risk of diabetes, which is linked to cholesterol imbalance. For optimal benefits, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intense exercise weekly.(Images: Canva)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_wFBVV95cUxPczZRUDBVMzJ3VDRVWDFZVGdZWDVFWmt6dnhYYWg5OGZHU2ZQd2huNHVWVS0tRDRsVjdrb3ZLcjNQa3h2Ym9KVW04VS16U2lfR2U4VzlsQ29hYWdWZng3NVo3c3FIRXFBbkJmLUt4bjFiMjlHTkFFRk1fNzhYelAxTVlaUzVOd19vVGxJZElKYnR6X0ZZeU13c3ZjLWdEZ0JfUGdfeHBSNlcxaDZ3ejFNZFliMGtCRE5OWkRHd2ZOcGZUb01pdUN6NFFZMmJReXBSVkw0bmRtM1ZBRV9SMzVObjZKdWpueUo3aGpVSjJxM0p2cTIzZHVPbWpJNHMzNDTSAYcCQVVfeXFMT3hFLXllWDFDU1hJeEFfTUNHdEMtclJnQWJfQ2NiM05uYXVwYVlzdnlSZEJTMUxLdFBWLVNqeVZmOHQwU2xrb1JGN3A3MEc5Y21aRlB6LXdUa2lWb3JOc1oycGZQdEJ0eTZGN2U2QVp0dFNtNkZpTS1heFpQVFVhYk4tdDVTSmpGMl9LWG1oUjRfdndEcW1xYXdMVGNOZzNpYkhzNW90aFNQRy1ndHluN3ZYcnRVWHBSRUpZWDJ2V0VEdWUxRi15XzBGYUJudFgweFVWMzU1Qk9CQnhwMjlGelRqbHB4SElITngzVEd5TUtpeVA1Qk9qaF80MkQxaEwtdmFxSjJtZk0</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Weight Loss: Semaglutide Could Curb Alcohol Cravings According to USC Study - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNTEgzUkJQNkFGU1dkMmlDZ3dubEI5bWxxT1ZMZXRqRS00MEZOWWJLUVR2cWFRT0hyQ2pBZ1ZUa2pGXzNjXzA4dTV1a05VblpwUVlmVEd2dDhaR0txb3pJZDVPemFONE4tNG04M2RiSHhCcXJlNnQ0aVl5YnNtcmxWRXpFQTFhTWxtbEdRajFLMzh0X3V0NkRrRHhHNnM1SFJUU1JQaWxEV0ZseUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 03:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNTEgzUkJQNkFGU1dkMmlDZ3dubEI5bWxxT1ZMZXRqRS00MEZOWWJLUVR2cWFRT0hyQ2pBZ1ZUa2pGXzNjXzA4dTV1a05VblpwUVlmVEd2dDhaR0txb3pJZDVPemFONE4tNG04M2RiSHhCcXJlNnQ0aVl5YnNtcmxWRXpFQTFhTWxtbEdRajFLMzh0X3V0NkRrRHhHNnM1SFJUU1JQaWxEV0ZseUk</guid></item><item><title>Eye health, long covid and a stress hormone: The week in Well+Being - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxORzlSdGZTanNybnVDbGVRZThZU0NJdWlhaXY5U1NoU0EtdWFIN05pQnpSVHVBa21UQjNUdEtGR1lfc1EwYlpWZU5GNC12dTVoZ1lPV2JHcC1xQV94S20xLUU2QmY2STJsTXhVWWd1dmUycm5JR1Z6by0zN3FQVUkyaHZFd1U3dEdzR2I4TTJJVEE4QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OP5HZZJNUVBLXNQQPFY7DOWAWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are reading our weekly Well+Being newsletter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/well-being/?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=ART&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NILWTAX5FBRPNG26ZWJFVBC6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Happy Thursday!

It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It was a shock," Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Jace's surgery was quick and "pretty easy", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;His son's progress has been "pretty amazing", he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision," Brendan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;No other options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp" alt="Moorfields Hospital Jace and his mum DJ having their photo taken in London on a sunny day with blue skies, with Tower Bridge in the background" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Moorfields Hospital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Jace came to London with his parents for the experimental gene therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;'Hugely impressive'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give "compelling evidence" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: "The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The team plans to monitor the children to see how long-lasting the results are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The results so far give them hope that intervening early in other childhood genetic eye conditions could offer the "greatest benefit" and ultimately transform children's lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 02:19:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9WZElYeVFfdkk2aUtCMmV3RDRGNUxuVGhDWlZGVVdXV1pTTk5XS1gyNlExdi1zOGhOTWduUWFmdTNiRlRBbmJHaVB6ZXB1dHVLTnd2NTZHczV1UdIBX0FVX3lxTE10RHZ1em1aTGxVLWV4M2x1dFdPTG5VXzIxcFdCSzBoeWVtdHlya04zWTlnTDdnTWhSVzFvM1N0RWY4UC0yeTVYblJOZklyQW5LXzF5dUxtQ3ZrcVIwcmU4</guid></item><item><title>Sweet Little Aussie Mix Gets Whacked with Brother’s ‘Helicopter Tail’ and Loves Every Second -

As you can see, he's super chill with other dogs and doesn't mind a helicopter tail or two; if you've got easily-excited dogs, he could be right for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you'd like to adopt any of the chocolate pups, including him, you can do so from &lt;a href="http://www.coldnosewarmheart.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cold Noses Warm Heart Rescue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cold Noses Warm Heart Rescue&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Dogs Can Live Happy Lives After Parvo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All five of the Chocolate pups struggled with Parvovirus when they first got to their foster home, and with consistent treatment and lots of love, all five of them managed to beat the illness!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Parvovirus is a &lt;a href="https://hartforanimals.org/pet-health-blog/2a6egbxl82yddlm-3hzfr-k4lcl-3mzd7-zn452" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:very scary thing;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;very scary thing; &lt;/a&gt;it's one of the first things puppies get vaccinated for when they're born. Parvovirus keeps a dog from being able to properly absorb nutrients; the virus attacks white blood cells and the gastrointestinal tract. It spreads easily and is fatal a lot of the time, but dogs may survive with early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/dogs/puppy-socialization-tips" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: The #1 Thing an Expert Dog Trainer Is Begging People to Consider When Adding a Puppy to the Family;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: The #1 Thing an Expert Dog Trainer Is Begging People to Consider When Adding a Puppy to the Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If Parvo is caught early enough, veterinarians can &lt;a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/parvovirus-transmission-treatment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:administer fluids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;administer fluids &lt;/a&gt;to help after the severe dehydration caused by the disease, as well as antibiotics. That's why you see the pup in this video with a shaved leg! Once Parvo is out of a dog's system, they can live a normal, long, and happy life. They should be vaccinated, though, after recovery.

"Over time, we saw a shift in the drug supply where fentanyl actually has started to enter the western drug markets … we also see a recent increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which has also infiltrated the drug market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nationwide, the overdose death rate from any opioid decreased from 25 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 24 deaths per 100,000 deaths in 2023. The death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone -- which includes fentanyl -- fell as well from 22.7 deaths to 22.2 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the overdose death rate for psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine, increased from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 10.6 deaths in 2023. The death rate for cocaine also increased from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 to 8.6 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"We should celebrate the decline in overdose deaths, particularly in some of those areas which have historically been most hard hit by this epidemic," Cerdá said. "And we should invest resources and trying to figure out why the decrease is happening, and how can we learn, particularly from those states that are experiencing this decrease to proactively respond to those states which are currently experiencing an increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:19:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2d9IBowFBVV95cUxQYTNOLUpkTGhCVWlNNnhuZHc5eFZmYU5IaXdnNkd0blVNcGpDa001WEN1TFpveWs4U2hhVFR0UjhwMTV5UC1DbmszNUtwOFZUcWJPQ2JjaVhldTBFY2tFYkFNUGJaWVN0YkNfZVZ4UEU2X3djUjF4cTBURjh0bFd6cGNRdGI2X2pYN2JqaWVuRUMtYWJ5UE5OdXVtYlJmTjE0QUhN</guid></item><item><title>Nine-year-old girl from Alden fighting for her life after testing positive for the flu - WKBW 7 News Buffalo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQOG13TngwbC1kbWEyRlVCMExNd1p1VTJFeXczZGZvcXU4TW1pWGtpVXVESG1IalkzVGZTS3I3LVJPZzJISHJfVnJTem5jRGx3RFc4NlpEMjJIWDc0d1U0SzJ1SHQwVHBDVDlseWNiOVRFbVpzT1hab1R5ZHhXaW9HZzY4WHFpLTJzS1d0SXRBTW9fR0ZieWxxTWxnMUxwYV95WWtydnZiX1ZtR05rMXRZeVdhaFkxUUkzcHhXd3dSVUo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALDEN, N.Y.

According to a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/miracles-for-mia-klyczek" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; set up for Mia, the nine-year-old had a seizure and was sedated with a breathing tube. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family said doctors believe flu B has caused severe swelling and bleeding in the brain, along with heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family is asking for prayers for their girl, hoping for a miracle. On Thursday morning Mia's mother Christina wrote the following on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"We were told by the neurologists this morning that the swelling in her brain is severe. There is no surgery or way to relieve the pressure other than what they are currently doing. They do not think she will survive."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 News spoke with a family friend who said the family is overwhelmed and appreciative of all the support during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Without it, the muscles showed a steep decline in function, particularly under physical strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The structure of striated, or skeletal, muscle.

This type of movement typically causes tiny muscle tears, which trigger growth and repair. But without GCN5, the muscles failed to recover, instead breaking down in a way that mimicked the effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type mice, which retained normal GCN5 levels, handled the same exercise without issue. Their muscles adapted and repaired as expected. The stark contrast between the two groups underscored GCN5’s essential role in muscle resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Menzies, these findings reflect what is seen in advanced aging and diseases like muscular dystrophy, where muscles progressively weaken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was further supported by human data, which showed a negative correlation between &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-approach-for-boosting-muscle-growth-during-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle fiber diameter&lt;/a&gt; and a multifunctional protein called Yin Yang 1. This protein, which plays a role in various cellular functions, was identified as a target of GCN5 in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant takeaway from the study was that GCN5 is responsible for promoting the production of key muscle proteins, particularly dystrophin. Dystrophin is the primary protein that maintains the integrity of muscle cells by acting as an anchor and shock absorber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767260/#:~:text=Dystrophin%20is%20a%20rod%20shape,two%20subunits%2C%20%CE%B1%20and%20%CE%B2." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dystrophin&lt;/a&gt;, muscles become highly vulnerable to damage, leading to severe health consequences. Dr. Menzies emphasized, “Our publication shows that if you knock out GCN5, the one major thing we see is a lack of dystrophin, without seeing any real disruption of any other mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also confirmed that removing GCN5 doesn’t affect the mitochondria—the part of the cell responsible for producing energy—indicating that GCN5’s role in muscle health is more structural than metabolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings build upon previous research demonstrating the importance of dystrophin in maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/just-3-seconds-of-daily-exercise-can-significantly-improve-muscle-strength-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health and integrity&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Menzies suggests that understanding GCN5’s function could help in the development of therapies for muscle degeneration in diseases like muscular dystrophy, as well as conditions related to aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dystrophin acts as a shock absorber within the muscle cells, reducing any damage caused by muscle contractions.

The most obvious sign of muscle atrophy is reduced muscle mass.

When these nerves are damaged, they can’t trigger the muscle contractions that are needed to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/surprising-muscle-significantly-increases-metabolism-and-burns-fat-while-sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stimulate muscle activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your muscles don’t contract, your body thinks you don’t need them anymore. So your body starts breaking them down, which causes them to decrease in size and strength.

&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth’s emergency department in Bellingham was overwhelmed by patients this week, forcing hours-long waits and the hospital to cancel some elective procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Close to 50 patients were waiting in the emergency room lobby on Tuesday, Feb. 18, with some patients waiting up to eight hours in the lobby before being seen and treated in the emergency department, according to a PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center employee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It “was a record for total number of patients in the department and total in the lobby waiting,” stated an internal hospital message sent on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point, there were more than 100 patients either in the emergency department lobby or being treated, according to the source, an emergency department employee who was granted confidentiality by Cascadia Daily News due to fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We had a patient in their 90s wait seven hours,” the employee said. “We had patients with chest pain waiting for hours to be seen, and patients in a crowded environment positive with the flu. It wasn’t a good situation at all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth was not immediately able to verify numbers provided to CDN, but did confirm that the hospital was “routinely seeing much higher daily” emergency department numbers than usual in February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The facility reported “unprecedented patient volumes” in the department due to rising cases of RSV, flu and other emergent health needs, according to a Feb. 19 news release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hospital urged those with non-emergency health issues to seek medical care elsewhere. These options include primary care providers, urgent care clinics and PeaceHealth’s priority care clinics, which offer same-day, drop-in care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please know that we treat everyone who visits our Emergency Department, but those with non-emergency needs will most likely have a longer wait time before we are able to care for them,” said Dr. James Scribner, medical director at PeaceHealth St. Joseph’s Emergency Department.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Some elective procedures at the hospital were canceled Wednesday morning. A voicemail left with a patient and shared with CDN stated that “the hospital is full to capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient, Rebecca Youlin, was told to contact her surgeon’s office to reschedule a biopsy procedure she started planning in November. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Youlin was able to reschedule for early March. But, she noted that if the biopsy eventually revealed any concerns, such as cancerous cells, she would be two weeks farther behind fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While scheduled to be a patient on Wednesday, Youlin is also an ICU nurse at PeaceHealth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This whole week has been insane,” she said, noting that she was concerned that the hospital was at capacity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Being at capacity] basically means that if you are sick enough to need a bed in the hospital, you may end up being boarded in the ER until a bed becomes available,” said Youlin, who has been a registered nurse for 15 years. “Believe me, when you are sick enough to be admitted, the ER is the least conducive environment to healing!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The confidential source at PeaceHealth told CDN that it has become common for part of the hospital’s emergency department to be partially filled with these “boarders” — patients who have been admitted but are awaiting a bed on a different floor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Youlin recognized that the nation is facing a &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/worst-flu-season-influenza-virus-spread-new-bird-flu-cases-us-plus"&gt;particularly bad flu season&lt;/a&gt;, she said the community has outgrown the medical facility. This is, in some ways, illustrated by how often a “code white” is declared at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A code white from the emergency room is essentially letting staff know they need to get all the patients that have admission orders to their rooms to make space for new patients, Youlin explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These code whites are being called on a daily basis, she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone is “inundated and slammed,” Youlin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth did not respond to a question about the number of code whites called at the facility so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “We are asking the community to consider other care options for non-emergency healthcare needs so our team can care for the most ill and vulnerable,” Dr. Scribner stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scribner encouraged anyone with difficulty breathing to come to the ER for an evaluation. He added that for other flu or respiratory virus symptoms, like body aches and coughing, self-care or a visit to a primary care physician or same-day clinic may be a more suitable option.&lt;/p&gt;

It was not expected. He was a very healthy middle aged male harbor seal," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said he is one of three animals there have died from Avian flu in the past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a bird that tested positive, and we had a wild black vulture that tested positive" said Rapoza. "But Blue was the first mammal that tested positive here on site."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Blue's death has been hard for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born at the zoo 21 years ago, an animal ambassador that educated people about seals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue  started on Feb. 1, when one of his keepers noticed he wasn't eating, which wasn't unusual, but noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next day he was showing some symptoms that seemed to be GI related, or stomach related," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue was treated and monitored, but he wasn't getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next step was potentially going to be a Cat scan," said Rapoza. "Unfortunately, on the morning of the fifth, which was the fifth day, the keeper came in to find that he had passed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an initial swab testing for Blue that came back negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recommendation from the Lincoln Park Zoo, which also recently lost a harbor seal to the Avian flu, resulted in a positive test from the National Vet Services Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luna and Conway, two female harbor seals, shared the habitat with Blue. They were separated from him as soon as he started to show symptoms. Rapoza said the zoo is constantly monitoring the girls' health, and doing everything they can to mitigate further risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harbor seal habitat is an open enclosure, but Rapoza said birds rarely enter the space, so it is not clear how Blue came in contact with a wild bird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttonwood Park Zoo and Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence told NBC 10 they are ramping up biosecurity measures to combat the Avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures include more footbaths at exhibits, and personal protective equipment for zookeepers, removing duck feeders, disinfecting and more actions to avoid cross contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harbor seal exhibit zookeeper Amanda Jacobson showed NBC 10 the mixture used for the footbaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have different areas that are different risk levels,  and just by doing this anywhere we can, it will minimize that risk," said Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim Wojick with Roger Williams Park Zoo acknowledged that Avian flu concerns are only getting worse, but there are things everyone can do to prevent the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It used to be something that we thought about, but didn't have to deal with," said Wojick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that it's here and it's widespread, we're now living in that reality where when we potentially make new exhibits, we're going to be looking at ways we can design those exhibits to keep our animals as safe as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Williams Park Zoo moved animals like its eagles from their open habitat to an enclosed space for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttonwood is testing all of its birds, monitoring the health of all of its animals, and educating the public on how to avoid spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've weathered the storm through West Nile, Triple E, COVID," said Rapoza. "Our guests do not have direct contact with our animals and so there is no risk to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapoza reminds that people not to feed wild birds, keep pets away from dead birds, and call animal control or DEM to assist with birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk has been lower to humans but there still have been human cases so don't touch anything without personal protective equipment," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro said it is monitoring for bird flu and will report suspicious bird deaths to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, keepers say they are not doing anything out of the ordinary, because they don’t have many waterfowl in their zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Turn to 10</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Drug overdose deaths fall in 2023 for 1st time since pandemic began: CDC - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Rates of drug overdose deaths decreased in the United States for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to new federal data published early Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The rate of overdose deaths fell from 32.6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2022 to 31.3 per 100,000 people in 2023, a 4% decrease, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/drug-overdose/drug-overdose-2022-2023.htm#table" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Aitzaz Munir, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and associate program director for the Rutgers Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program, told ABC News the drop in the overdose death rate was "surprising" to him but a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He said he believes the decrease in deaths may be due to a more "aggressive approach" toward the treatment of drug conditions including more treatment programs and making them more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This includes making &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/overdose-reversal-drug-narcan-buy-counter-starting-september/story?id=102671170" target="_blank"&gt;naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, more widely available&lt;/a&gt; and increasing the availability of drug checking supplies, including fentanyl test strips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So, there might be a better response in places where these treatments are available and patients are getting those treatments," he said.

It is up to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, and can be deadly even in small doses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She said the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2024/11/15/deas-third-annual-national-family-summit-fentanyl-highlights-progress" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that the potency of fentanyl pills agents have been seizing was decreasing, which may be contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"As the drug supply has become more saturated with fentanyl, good drug supply may be becoming more stable, and people may be just developing a tolerance for fentanyl," Cerdá said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report found that West Virginia was the state with the highest rate at 81.9 deaths per 100,000 while Nebraska had the lowest rate at 9.0 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, between 2022 and 2023, rates of drug overdose deaths decreased in 20 states and did not change significantly in 25 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, over that same period, increases were seen in six states: Alabama, Alaska, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cerdá said one hypothesis is that the increase in overdose death rates in western states may be due to shifts in the drug market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We saw that the penetration of fentanyl really started in the East Coast," she said. "Over time, we saw a shift in the drug supply where fentanyl actually has started to enter the western drug markets … we also see a recent increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which has also infiltrated the drug market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nationwide, the overdose death rate from any opioid decreased from 25 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 24 deaths per 100,000 deaths in 2023. The death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone -- which includes fentanyl -- fell as well from 22.7 deaths to 22.2 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the overdose death rate for psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine, increased from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 10.6 deaths in 2023. The death rate for cocaine also increased from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 to 8.6 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"We should celebrate the decline in overdose deaths, particularly in some of those areas which have historically been most hard hit by this epidemic," Cerdá said. "And we should invest resources and trying to figure out why the decrease is happening, and how can we learn, particularly from those states that are experiencing this decrease to proactively respond to those states which are currently experiencing an increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 23:59:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2dw</guid></item><item><title>2 'exclusively indoor' cats in Michigan caught bird flu, potentially from their owners - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxPQUlaWTk0V25xNlJaeWhpbEJDX0laU1lMVHNfMVRteUJjRTNLYllnVmpiN0xzaEhPakdOelc4WFYzLThpS1paSmJWYzRCaWFwYlpYZlZ1Ri1sMmVaZ1VIT2p4OVNVZ3NwVDlZSmxIZ3lLZWs2VFE2cG15TlRfdzNLMkhjZDFJSDAxZ08zYUlFYV9JOHF3c3ZPQXdwUlhhejFlRGoydnRwaUNPelQybmpVdG41ODd1czcyRUhSZ09XNklvZzM2ZXBTeWxwUEVoRVo3UFB3Tkh1VDN1NUswTFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

Live Science is in contact with the CDC and will update it when they respond.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two "exclusively indoor" cats from two separate households in Michigan caught H5N1 bird flu and ultimately died, according to a new report. The cases raise the possibility that people in the cats' households passed the virus on to their pets, but a lack of data somewhat muddies the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are described in a new &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MMWR) published Thursday (Feb. 20).

That cat, a 5-year-old female, initially started showing a lack of appetite, as well as lethargy and disorientation. The cat was brought to a local vet and then the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Medical Center, which has advanced treatments available. But due to "rapid disease progression," the cat was euthanized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been reported on some Michigan dairy farms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by that time, and the cat's owner worked on a dairy farm, although not directly with the animals. The sick cat's body was submitted for further testing after euthanization, and swabs from the cat's brain and nose came back positive for H5N1. The virus samples from the cat matched the viruses circulating in local cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery prompted a broader investigation, in which officials found that another indoor cat in the household developed potential bird flu symptoms after the first cat did. These symptoms included decreased appetite and watery eye discharge, but the cat ultimately recovered without specific treatment. No specimens from the second cat were tested for H5N1, but the timing of illness may point to possible transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the dairy worker declined to be tested for bird flu, they did report experiencing vomiting and diarrhea a day before the first cat got sick. The three other members of the worker's household tested negative for influenza A, the broad group of viruses H5N1 belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the picture, one person in the household — a teenager who'd had "regular contact" with the sick cat — got sick about six days after the cat did. Their symptoms included cough, sore throat, headache and muscle aches. However, the teen tested negative for flu and instead came back positive on a test that looks for other common viruses, such as common-cold viruses. So while the timing of the teen's infection could be worrisome, based on these test results, it may be that the individual had a run-of-the-mill respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time frame in a different Michigan household, a second indoor cat came down with bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 6-month-old male, that cat was also an exclusively indoor pet. The owner brought the cat into the MSU clinic after it showed one day of "progressive neurologic deterioration," facial swelling and stopped eating. The cat died within 24 hours of these symptoms emerging. Nasal swabs from the cat were positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cat's owner, a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized (raw) milk from various farms, declined testing for bird flu. The worker had a "fear of losing employment as a consequence of communicating with public health officials and implicating farms that provided milk," the MMWR notes. However, the worker did report having notable eye irritation two days before the cat got sick. (Recent H5N1 infections in humans have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;often involved eye symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, namely conjunctivitis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worker also reported having not worn protective equipment when handling raw milk and frequently experiencing "splash exposures" to the face, eyes and clothing while working. The cat that got infected and died frequently rolled in the owner's clothes, whereas a second cat in the household that didn't get sick did not exhibit that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because neither dairy worker received testing for A(H5), whether cat 1A's owner's gastrointestinal symptoms or cat 2A's owner's ocular symptoms were because of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection or a different etiology [cause] is unknown," the MMWR says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, a data table included in the new MMWR was actually published earlier in the month, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 6. This seems to have been accidental, as the table was promptly taken down. (Live Science has asked the CDC to confirm whether this data table is the same one that was taken down, but based on that previous news story, the data appears the same.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Times report, in early February, the data table had briefly appeared in a report that otherwise focused on air quality and the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/wildfires-raging-in-la-are-being-fueled-by-santa-ana-winds-what-are-they" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/wildfires-raging-in-la-are-being-fueled-by-santa-ana-winds-what-are-they"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles County wildfires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Times reported. Prior to the wildfire report's release, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-health-agencies-communication-allowed-still-blocked-rcna190527" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-health-agencies-communication-allowed-still-blocked-rcna190527" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pause had been placed on external communications from federal health agencies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the CDC's MMWR, which had been published every week for decades.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four young children have gained life-changing improvements in sight following treatment with a pioneering new genetic medicine through UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital, with the support of MeiraGTx.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The children were born with a severe impairment to their sight due to a rare genetic deficiency that affects the AIPL1 gene. The condition, a form of retinal dystrophy, means those affected are born with only sufficient sight to distinguish between light and darkness. The gene defect causes the retinal cells to malfunction and die, with children affected being legally certified as blind from birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new treatment is designed to enable the retinal cells to work better and to survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure, developed by UCL scientists, consists of injecting healthy copies of the gene into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery. These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, so they can penetrate the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retinal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal cells&lt;/a&gt; and replace the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/defective+gene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;defective gene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition is very rare, and the first children identified were from overseas. To mitigate any potential safety issues, the first four children received this novel therapy in one eye only. All four saw remarkable improvements in the treated eye over the following three to four years, but lost sight in their untreated eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of the new treatment, reported in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;, show that gene therapy at an early age can dramatically improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sight/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt; for children with this condition—one that is rare and particularly severe. Successful gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness (RPE65 deficiency) has been available on the NHS since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;These new findings offer hope that children affected by both rare and more common forms of genetic blindness may in time also benefit from genetic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now exploring the means to make this new treatment more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor James Bainbridge, professor of retinal studies at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and consultant retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, said, "Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development. Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Michel Michaelides, professor of ophthalmology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and consultant retinal specialist at Moorfields Eye Hospital, commented, "We have, for the first time, an effective treatment for the most severe form of childhood blindness, and a potential paradigm shift to treatment at the earliest stages of the disease. The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; to change lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure to administer the treatment to the affected children took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The children were assessed in the NIHR Moorfields Clinical Research Facility, and the NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Center provided infrastructure for the research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIVERSIDE, Calif. — Four black rats in Riverside County tested positive for Bird Flu. It is the first time the H5N1 virus has been found in rats.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture &lt;/a&gt;(USDA), health officials found the four rats over the course of three days, from January 29, 2025, through January 31.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the USDA found the virus spreading to other animals, including domestic cats. In January, two house cats in the Bay Area tested positive for Bird Flu, and two tested positive in Los Angeles. Health officials in Oregon and Montana also found the virus had spread to domestic cats last month.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, the virus has also spread to marine life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 5, a harbor seal in Bristol, Massachusetts, tested positive for bird flu, and two bottlenose dolphins in Florida were also found to, also found to be infected. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild birds typically spread bird flu, and it is highly contagious, most often fatal in birds. In recent years, the virus has infected mammals as well as humans. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From March 2024 through December 2024, health officials have confirmed 61 cases of bird flu in humans, 34 of which were in California. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has also had a major impact on poultry farms and has resulted in an increase in the price of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the outbreak began in 2022, the bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus.

Essentially, kidney stones are hard deposits made up of minerals and salts that form in your kidneys. If you’ve never had one, count your blessings. If you have, then you already know you'd do just about anything to avoid another visit from these sinister stones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now, while there’s no magic spell to guarantee you’ll be kidney-stone-free for life, there are a few lifestyle changes and dietary tweaks that might tip the odds in your favor. Enter the latest research finding: data published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports &lt;/em&gt;suggests that increasing niacin intake might help reduce the risk of developing kidney stones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This article will take a closer look at the details of this new research and explore what it means for you. By understanding these findings, you’ll gain insight into how you may have one more tool in the arsenal against those pebble-sized pains in the back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kidney stones are a common issue, affecting around 11% of certain populations in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is an important nutrient that the body needs to function properly. However, while niacin plays many crucial roles in the body, it is unclear if this nutrient impacts kidney stone risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at data from a large health survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that took place from 2007 to 2018. Researchers evaluated what people ate over a 24-hour period to learn how much niacin they were consuming. They also asked participants if they had a history of kidney stones through a questionnaire.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To study the potential link between niacin intake and kidney stones, they used advanced statistical methods to analyze the data. The study included a total of 28,508 participants, making it a thorough investigation into whether niacin in your diet might affect kidney stone risk. The average age of the participants was a little over 47 years old. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After analyzing the data, researchers found that people who experience kidney stones often share certain characteristics. They are more likely to be men, older, white, have higher household incomes, smoke, exercise more and have a history of conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes. Interestingly, they also tend to consume less niacin through their diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When comparing those who ate the least niacin with those who ate the most, the latter group had about 22% lower chances of getting kidney stones. This benefit was particularly noticeable in people under the age of 60. Scientists also observed that the connection between niacin and kidney stone risk wasn't entirely straightforward—it followed an "L-shaped" pattern, showing that even a modest increase in niacin intake seemed to help reduce the risk. These findings suggest that including more niacin-rich foods in your diet may make a difference in kidney stone risk reduction, especially for younger adults.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The author of this study suggests that while the reason why niacin may impact kidney stones remains unclear, one possible reason is because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Kidney stones often form from calcium crystals in a process that involves inflammation and oxidative stress, a condition where potentially harmful molecules, known as reactive oxygen species, may damage cells. Niacin has antioxidant properties that help fight these effects. Niacin may also support the health of mitochondria, the energy producers in cells, which may help prevent crystal buildup in the kidneys. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few important limits to consider in the study. First, since it was cross-sectional, it means we can't say for sure that eating more or less niacin is what causes changes in kidney stone risk. Cross-sectional studies capture data at a single point in time, making it difficult to establish cause-and-effect relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, the researchers relied on participants to report their dietary habits and kidney stone history through questionnaires, so there's always a chance that some details were misremembered. Also, certain specifics, like the exact makeup of the kidney stones, weren't included in the database used. Lastly, eating habits can change over time, and since dietary information was recorded from 24-hour recalls, it might not represent long-term patterns. Despite these challenges, this study sheds light on how diet might help prevent kidney stones, but future studies are needed to further confirm these findings and understand the role of niacin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply To Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re someone who has experienced kidney stones (or you’d just like to avoid them), the findings of this study offer an intriguing slice of hope. It seems that niacin intake may play a role in reducing your risk of these painful deposits. While it’s not an excuse to go and raid your local supplement aisle just yet, it might be a good time to look at how much niacin you’re getting in your daily diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, it's not quite as simple as just sprinkling niacin over your dinner and declaring yourself invincible. Kidney stones can be caused by many factors—hydration levels, genetics and underlying health conditions can all influence your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This research doesn't eliminate any of those factors, but it does suggest that niacin might be one part of a bigger puzzle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s important to approach it with realistic expectations. You don’t need to overhaul your entire diet overnight or start obsessing over niacin levels. Small, thoughtful adjustments, like prioritizing foods rich in this nutrient while keeping up with other healthy habits, may make a meaningful difference over time. After all, when the alternative is potentially passing a kidney stone, any edge you can get is worth considering, right? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some foods to focus on if you are trying to increase your niacin intake:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicken Breast:&lt;/strong&gt; A lean and versatile source of protein, chicken breast is packed with niacin to support your dietary needs. Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-herb-roasted-chicken-8598690" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken&lt;/a&gt; for a simple chicken dish. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuna:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether fresh or canned, tuna offers a robust amount of niacin alongside heart-healthy omega-3s. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tuna-white-bean-melt-8763513" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tuna and White Bean Melt&lt;/a&gt; is a unique twist on a classic tuna-forward recipe. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turkey:&lt;/strong&gt; Turkey, especially the light meat, is a low-fat option rich in niacin, making it a great choice for balanced meals. Opting for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/276382/slow-cooker-turkey-thighs-with-herb-gravy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Slow-Cooker Turkey Thighs&lt;/a&gt; is a convenient way to make turkey tender and delicious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peanuts:&lt;/strong&gt; These convenient and tasty snacks are not only high in protein but also a great plant-based source of niacin. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261621/rice-cakes-with-peanut-butter/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Rice Cakes with Peanut Butter&lt;/a&gt; is an easy peanut-forward snack to try. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mushrooms:&lt;/strong&gt; Cremini and portobello mushrooms in particular are natural sources of niacin and bring a savory, earthy flavor to dishes. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275734/easy-stuffed-mushrooms/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Easy Stuffed Mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; make for a delicious dish that includes mushrooms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other common sources of niacin include brown rice and salmon—so a simple rice bowl like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/crispy-salmon-rice-bowl-8628232" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Crispy Salmon Rice Bowl&lt;/a&gt; is also a great way to add some niacin to your day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And though it seems like a simple solution, we wouldn’t recommend you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;take a niacin supplement&lt;/a&gt; without consulting with your healthcare provider. It’s always a good idea to speak with your doctor before adding a supplement to your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the science linking niacin intake to a reduced risk of kidney stones is still evolving, this research in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; holds promise for anyone hoping to steer clear of these notorious nuisances. Incorporating niacin-rich foods into your diet might just be another step toward keeping your kidneys happy and healthy. But remember, no single nutrient is a cure-all. A balanced diet, proper hydration, and an awareness of individual risk factors are all essential pieces of the puzzle. And when it comes to kidney stones, it’s always better to prevent than to pass, right?
&lt;/p&gt;

Inflammation in her body went down, her appetite was quelled, and she lost five pounds in the first week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later her doctor increased her dosage to 1.7mg, standard procedure when the patient is acclimating well and could benefit from a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Burgess began experiencing debilitating side effects, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;nausea and severe&lt;/a&gt; stomach pain. She was vomiting and had occasional diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess' goal was to lose 50 lbs with the help of Ozempic. Since starting it in 2023, she has lost 60lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized this is not okay. This is not how I wanted to lose weight,’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when she and her doctor discussed microdosing the drug - or taking less than the 0.25 mg starter dose, which she had tolerated with no side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, Ms Burgess has lost 60 lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear how many people have personalized their treatment to microdose, but for Ms Burgess it was a life-changing hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dosages of Ozempic and similar drugs, including Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound, are meant to be increased very gradually, roughly every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katie Sorensen, a nurse practitioner specializing in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, who was not involved in Burgess’ treatment, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://parade.com/health/i-tried-microdosing-on-ozempic"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The microdosing strategy has some attractive benefits, including helping to mitigate side effects and being able to customize the dose to the minimum efficacious dose for individual patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microdosing regimen has not been approved by the FDA, in part because ‘we would not be able to say for certain that a patient is reaping the full potential benefits of GLP-1 medications that have been shown in recent clinical trials,’ according to Ms Sorensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If individuals experience weight loss with small doses, it could be because they are what scientists refer to as ‘super responders.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This term describes a specific group of people who achieve significant weight loss rapidly when taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have shown most people need to remain on semaglutide or a similar drug indefinitely in order to keep the weight off, it's not clear if those rules apply to a microdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But research into the drug's long-term effects is beginning to suggest that, regardless of dosage, a person must keep taking it because, while it suppresses appetite, it doesn't permanently alter the metabolism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison did not disclose the dosage she is currently taking, but she has not experienced any adverse side effects in the two years she’s been microdosing Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her appetite is back, but the food noise has abated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I’m a big advocate now of microdosing. Going slow and staying low is my motto nowadays and I think it’s better for long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s been absolutely great.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess began microdosing Ozempic when a higher dose made her sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A UK study found that people who used Wegovy experienced rapid weight loss, dropping 18% of their weight over 68 weeks.

Determined not to let her weight loss stall after lowering her dose, she also prioritized eating more fiber and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘You can’t think you can get on a GLP-1 medication and it’s going to completely change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just a tool. You need to create sustainable healthy habits to progress in the long run, especially if you eventually get off it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who stop taking the medications do regain some or all of the weight they lost and some people end up weighing more.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study last autumn found a majority of people who stopped taking semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic - regained about two-thirds of the weight loss and had worsening health markers, including higher blood pressure and cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 12 percent of US adults report having ever used Ozempic or another similar medication for weight loss, while six percent indicated they were currently using the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 85 percent of people who had recently started medications like Ozempic discontinued use within two years, and 71 percent stopped within the first year, either because they had reached their goal weight or because the drugs were too expensive - with a price tag of approximately $1,000 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots have also been shown to raise the risk of life-altering and even deadly effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have raised concerns about popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic potentially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14380795/ozempic-patients-blind-doctors-effect.html"&gt;leading to blindness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has connected these injections to conditions that trigger inflammation and restrict blood flow to the eye, resulting in severe and sometimes irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicines have also been shown to cause stomach paralysis, a condition where the stomach muscles don't function properly, leading to delayed emptying of food into the small intestine, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13813961/Ozempic-triggered-deadly-effect-forced-ORGAN-removed-robbed-basic-human-function.html"&gt;and ischemic colitis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where reduced blood flow to the colon causes inflammation and injury to the intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DailyMail.com investigation last year also revealed that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13816987/deaths-linked-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-analysis.html"&gt;at least 160 people&lt;/a&gt; have died while taking Ozempic. None of the deaths are proven to have been directly caused by the injections, but experts say the reports indicate cases where they're suspected to have played a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 22:35:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQb2tBNGpRVVluZ0ZVVEJaMTlfZU9naURSYUREbHFJZEZvdmpmOEs1cmprdFI1bERvN1NiSno3RDQwUm1PQ3NFXzdnQzhoNllfTzVCYTd4dWp3aVRUQ1ZzS2g1TFFxc2I4WTNPcnRuTmNCTlZ3THFBNC1HaVF0amNXb29fel9fWVl4MzV6eTRjU1dKUUMxTkJ0Mm1vcVdwZVZqNElrY0RPZnprY0JGeHI4</guid></item><item><title>I tried microdosing Ozempic... what happened shocked even doctors - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison Burgess had struggled with her weight for most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 25-year-old hit roadblocks on the path to her goal of losing 50lbs, including a workout regimen that didn’t seem to be helping and a persistent sweet tooth that had her reaching for desserts more than she’d like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Burgess, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-741f30b0-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; native, was considering bariatric surgery - a procedure that makes the stomach smaller and reduces how much a person can eat - in 2023 when Ozempic and similar drugs exploded in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In March 2023, she signed up with Claya, an online weight loss treatment platform, and met virtually with a doctor who prescribed her Ozempic, the groundbreaking &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-74163000-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug given off-label to help people &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-741879f0-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injectable medication is given once every four weeks, and dosages start at 0.25 mg, typically increasing every four weeks, to be capped at 2 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Burgess started at the lowest dose and saw immediate positive results. Inflammation in her body went down, her appetite was quelled, and she lost five pounds in the first week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later her doctor increased her dosage to 1.7mg, standard procedure when the patient is acclimating well and could benefit from a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Burgess began experiencing debilitating side effects, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;nausea and severe&lt;/a&gt; stomach pain. She was vomiting and had occasional diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess' goal was to lose 50 lbs with the help of Ozempic. Since starting it in 2023, she has lost 60lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized this is not okay. This is not how I wanted to lose weight,’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when she and her doctor discussed microdosing the drug - or taking less than the 0.25 mg starter dose, which she had tolerated with no side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, Ms Burgess has lost 60 lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear how many people have personalized their treatment to microdose, but for Ms Burgess it was a life-changing hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dosages of Ozempic and similar drugs, including Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound, are meant to be increased very gradually, roughly every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katie Sorensen, a nurse practitioner specializing in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, who was not involved in Burgess’ treatment, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://parade.com/health/i-tried-microdosing-on-ozempic"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The microdosing strategy has some attractive benefits, including helping to mitigate side effects and being able to customize the dose to the minimum efficacious dose for individual patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microdosing regimen has not been approved by the FDA, in part because ‘we would not be able to say for certain that a patient is reaping the full potential benefits of GLP-1 medications that have been shown in recent clinical trials,’ according to Ms Sorensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If individuals experience weight loss with small doses, it could be because they are what scientists refer to as ‘super responders.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This term describes a specific group of people who achieve significant weight loss rapidly when taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have shown most people need to remain on semaglutide or a similar drug indefinitely in order to keep the weight off, it's not clear if those rules apply to a microdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But research into the drug's long-term effects is beginning to suggest that, regardless of dosage, a person must keep taking it because, while it suppresses appetite, it doesn't permanently alter the metabolism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison did not disclose the dosage she is currently taking, but she has not experienced any adverse side effects in the two years she’s been microdosing Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her appetite is back, but the food noise has abated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I’m a big advocate now of microdosing. Going slow and staying low is my motto nowadays and I think it’s better for long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s been absolutely great.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess began microdosing Ozempic when a higher dose made her sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A UK study found that people who used Wegovy experienced rapid weight loss, dropping 18% of their weight over 68 weeks. They regained two-thirds of that weight, or 12 percent of their original body weight in the year after dropping the weekly shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeing those first five pounds melt away motivated Ms Burgess to get the most out of her medication. Determined not to let her weight loss stall after lowering her dose, she also prioritized eating more fiber and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘You can’t think you can get on a GLP-1 medication and it’s going to completely change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just a tool.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently reported new evidence from a study of a medical device placed inside the body, a spine-&lt;strong&gt;stimulating&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;implant&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people with a muscle-destroying disease got a little stronger after using the implant. They were able to stand and walk more easily because of electrical stimulation to their spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco Capogrosso is an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburg, or Pitt, who led the research. "These people were definitely not expecting an improvement," he said. Capogrosso said, "They were getting better and better," over the study that lasted one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returning muscle function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implant was able to return some muscle &lt;strong&gt;function&lt;/strong&gt;, at least temporarily. The implant was already being tested to treat &lt;strong&gt;paralysis&lt;/strong&gt; in other patients. This new evidence suggests it might also aid diseases of the nervous system like spinal muscle atrophy, or SMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMA is a genetic disease that slowly destroys motor &lt;strong&gt;neurons&lt;/strong&gt;, nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscles. That leads muscles to waste away, especially in the legs, hips, and shoulders and sometimes those involved with breathing and swallowing. There is no cure. A gene therapy can save the lives of very young children with a severe form of the disease, and there are some medicines to slow the disease in older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulating the spinal cord with low levels of electricity has long been used to treat chronic, or long-term, pain. Capogrosso's team also has tested it to help people paralyzed by &lt;strong&gt;strokes&lt;/strong&gt; or spinal cord injury move their arms and legs with assistance. The system sends electrical signals to nerves that have stopped reacting. This has the effect of activating the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso wondered if that same technology might help patients with SMA by stimulating sensory nerves to signal damaged muscle cells causing them to move. The researchers at the University of Pittsburgh published their study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They implanted electrodes over the lower spinal cord of the three adults with SMA. Using the device did not return normal movement but with a few hours of spinal stimulation a week, all soon experienced improvements in muscle strength and function, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"You never get better"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven-year-old Doug McCullough took part in the study. "With a progressive disease you never get any better," he said, adding, “So having any improvement is just a really &lt;strong&gt;surreal&lt;/strong&gt; and very exciting &lt;strong&gt;benefit&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three subjects increased how far they could walk in six minutes by the study's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said they could walk farther because they got less tired and “even a person this many years into the disease can improve."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found the improvements did not disappear as soon as the stimulator was turned off. But they did decrease a few months after the study ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Susan Harkema led similar studies of stimulation for spinal cord injuries while at the University of Louisville. She warned that the new study is small and did not last very long but said it was an important test of the device. She said it should be tested next with other muscle-&lt;strong&gt;degenerating&lt;/strong&gt; diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said some small but longer studies are beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. wanted advertisements that promote the idea of “informed consent” in vaccine decision-making instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any drug they are prescribed. It is a cornerstone of health care delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shifting the framing of advertising for vaccines that the CDC has long recommended — like flu shots — to more heavily focus on the risks of vaccines could undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated, or to have their children immunized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Informed consent is always a must,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. But he suggested generating materials that focus heavily on possible risks without putting them in the context of proven benefits could badly hurt vaccination rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision to pull flu shot advertising is an early sign of how RFK Jr. may shift the U.S. approach to vaccinations as the nation’s top health official. Others came Thursday as well: The CDC’s influential vaccine advisory committee &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting-postponed/"&gt;postponed a meeting scheduled for next week&lt;/a&gt;, and Politico reported that RFK Jr. may remove some members of that committee and other influential public health bodies, claiming they have &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;STAT asked HHS whether the CDC had been instructed to cease promotional campaigns for several vaccines, including the Wild to Mild flu vaccine campaign, and whether the HHS secretary wanted replacements that focus on informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an emailed response, an official did not answer the second question, and denied that the CDC had been told to take down its flu vaccination campaign website — which was not the question asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No, the CDC was not told to take down the flu vaccination campaign webpage,” said an HHS spokesperson. “Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump’s agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s own &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;informational pages&lt;/a&gt; on the benefits of flu shots still remain. The materials that sources told STAT they were instructed to take down were for paid promotions on other websites. Versions of those promotions were previously visible on some CDC webpages but are no longer up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Flu vaccination can keep you from getting sick with flu,” one of the remaining pages states. “Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related doctor’s visits each year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, uptake rates for a number of vaccines have declined. About 23% of adults have received an updated Covid-19 shot. And though this flu season has been protracted, about 45% of people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have received a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this season — down about five percentage points from flu shot uptake in the pre-Covid era.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-hhs-secretary-pick-rfk-jr-financial-disclosures-biotech-investments-book-advances/"&gt;generated substantial income &lt;/a&gt;from challenging the safety of vaccines — through paid speeches, books, his former position as founder and chair of Children’s Health Defense, and as a lawyer suing vaccine manufacturers — refused repeatedly during his Senate confirmation hearings to distance himself from disproven claims about the safety of vaccines, such as the claim that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;vaccines are behind rising autism rates&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, he said during the hearing that he is not opposed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though several senators expressed concern about Kennedy’s positions on vaccines, only former Senate leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a survivor of polio, voted against Kennedy’s confirmation on the Republican side of the chamber.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) expressed serious concerns about Kennedy during the hearings on his nomination. Cassidy is a physician who strongly supports vaccination. But in the end he voted for Kennedy after receiving &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;assurances&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy would work within the current system and not undermine vaccination efforts in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The promotional campaigns the CDC was ordered to stop involved modest outlays of money, one source told STAT. They included paid ads in digital publications or promoted posts on social media platforms, the individual said. NPR &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; that the “Wild to Mild” campaign was halted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ads featured images of fierce and less threatening animals — one juxtaposed a teddy bear against a grizzly — to convey the message that even if flu vaccines do not always prevent infection, people who receive them are less likely to become seriously ill and to need hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Flu can be wild. But a flu vaccine can shield both you and your cub from flu’s more serious symptoms,” said one of the ads, aimed at pregnant people. “Ask your health care provider about a flu shot during your pregnancy to protect your baby after birth — when they’re too young to be vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other iterations of the campaign were aimed at parents, adults with chronic conditions, people over the age of 65, and health care professionals.&lt;br&gt;In the materials viewable on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250131145821/https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/toolkit/social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a now scrubbed webpage&lt;/a&gt; there was no discussion about risks from flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are few side effects from flu vaccination, and those that are reported — things like injection site reactions, headaches and fatigue — are short-lived. In some, though not all, years, flu vaccination appears to be linked to a slightly higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/guillain-barre.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a form of progressive and generally temporary paralysis. In the seasons when an increase of GBS has been seen it is at a rate of about one or two additional cases per one million doses of flu vaccine administered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being infected with the flu is known to increase the risk of developing GBS as well. Ensuring that people are aware of the risks of vaccines before receiving them is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;one of the six parts of a vaccine safety plan&lt;/a&gt; that RFK Jr. published in 2023. Already, people receive printed information with the risks of vaccines before they or their children are immunized, and advertising for specific vaccines is required to disclose side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Is your ZIP code more important than your genetic code when it comes to having a long, healthy life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics and lifestyle both contribute to how people age, the diseases they develop and how long they're likely to live. But the role the factors play and how much they influence disease development and premature death might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomics and lifestyle have more to do with healthy aging than genetics, according to a big new international study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; that says both lifestyle choices and living conditions are significantly more important than genetics to living a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, of 25 independent exposures associated with premature death, age-related diseases and healthy aging, "We find that the major drivers or premature death and aging in our sample are smoking, socioeconomic status and deprivation, ethnicity, physical activity, living with a partner, sleep and mental and physical wellness including tiredness, as well as early life exposures including health and body size at 10 years and maternal smoking around birth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They note that many factors combine to form the "environmental architecture of mortality and aging," and each may play a very small role, but adding them up creates a "substantial amount of variation for premature mortality, far exceeding" that posed by genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your income, postcode and background shouldn't determine your chances of living a long and healthy life," Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said in a news release. "But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study nuts and bolts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by researchers from Oxford Population Health in collaboration with researchers from the departments of psychiatry and anthropology at the University of Oxford; Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute, Boston; the University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University, Rotterdam; and the University of Montpellier. They also got technical help from the China Kadoorie Biobank team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data researchers used included extensive genetic and phenotype information on 502,505 people who were participants in UK Biobank research and data collection. They looked at 164 environmental facts and genetic risk scores for 22 major diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of the research was an "aging clock" that used blood protein levels to see how fast people aged. "This enabled them to link environmental exposures that predict early mortality with biological aging," the team said in background material on the study. The measure has also been validated in large studies in China and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornelia van Duijn, St. Cross professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and the paper's senior author, noted that instead of focusing on individual exposures and hypotheses, they used a hypothesis-free, lifetime exposure approach to see what drives disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genes vs. lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors explained 17% of the death risk variation, while genetic predisposition "as we understand it at present" explained just 2%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the 25 environmental factors, those with the most impact on healthy or unhealthy aging were smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity and living conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking was linked to 21 diseases, while socioeconomic factors like household income, employment and home ownership were linked to 19 diseases. Physical activity impacted 17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the factors, 23 could be changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early life exposures, including whether your mother smoked around the time of your birth and your body weight at 10 years old, influenced aging and risk of death decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental exposure had a greater effect on lung, heart and liver disease, while genetic risk was stronger for dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote physical activity. While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally," said van Duijn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, "The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate aging early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Austin Argentieri, lead author of the study at Oxford Population Health and research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the approach they used made the research the "most comprehensive to date of the environmental and lifestyle factors driving aging and premature death. These findings underscore the potential benefits of focusing interventions on our environments, socioeconomic contexts and behaviors for the prevention of many age-related diseases and premature death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente in Colorado will be an inaugural member of the newly announced Food Is Medicine Colorado coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.projectangelheart.org/"&gt;Project Angel Heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://feedingcolorado.org/"&gt;Feeding Colorado&lt;/a&gt; launched the coalition at the 2024 Colorado Food Is Medicine Summit. The event was co-sponsored by Kaiser Permanente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIMCO will be a statewide coalition of community-based organizations, state agencies, hospitals, and health care organizations. FIMCO will promote recognition of healthy food as a cost-effective way to manage health conditions in Colorado. It will also integrate Food Is Medicine into mainstream health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kaiser Permanente has been a leader in supporting Food Is Medicine efforts in Colorado and nationally,” said Kate Johnston, chief operating officer of Project Angel Heart. “We look forward to the valuable health care expertise that they will bring to this coalition."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the idea of Food Is Medicine has grown, these programs have clearly shown their clinical benefits,” said Jeff Krawcek, MD, president and executive medical director of Kaiser Permanente in Colorado. “If we can improve people’s health or prevent them from getting sick in the first place, that is a major win for health care in Colorado.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an inaugural member of FIMCO, Kaiser Permanente is the first health care organization to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to lead Colorado’s health care community in this space and gather more industry support for Food Is Medicine,” said Mike Ramseier, president of Kaiser Permanente in Colorado. “It’s part of our mission to improve the health of the communities we serve, and FIMCO is designed to make a coordinated impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food Is Medicine has the potential to reduce hospital readmissions and decrease individual treatment costs for conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. Those shifts could save the American health care system nearly $14 billion per year, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797397"&gt;a study from the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, Kaiser Permanente recently announced its &lt;a href="/news/press-release-archive/launching-the-food-is-medicine-center-of-excellence"&gt;Food Is Medicine Center of Excellence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center will shape the future of Food Is Medicine across health care. It will expand food insecurity screening for Kaiser Permanente members, expand training for health professionals, and create new approaches to Food Is Medicine interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also serve as a research hub. And the center will expand partnerships with local nonprofits, government agencies, and businesses to improve nutrition security for Kaiser Permanente members and our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente is also a founding member of the &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/02/06/tufts-university-and-leading-health-care-organizations-launch-food-medicine-national"&gt;Food is Medicine Network of Excellence&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Tufts University Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School. The network will establish best practices for implementing, evaluating, and integrating food-based interventions into health care systems and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though you can’t literally get in there with dental floss (bummer) you can create a similar effect with “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?lang=en&amp;amp;q=brain%20flossing&amp;amp;t=1740061816249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;bilateral stimulation&lt;/a&gt;” music — a trend that’s going viral on TikTok that’s said to &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-deal-with-anxiety-at-work-according-to-experts-18018600" class="T3D"&gt;help improve anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, stress, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?lang=en&amp;amp;q=brain%20flossing&amp;amp;t=1740061816249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;brain flossing&lt;/a&gt;” or “brain massage,” bilateral stimulation is a type of sound that bounces between your right and left ears. It creates a panning effect that makes it seem like the tune is gliding from one side of your brain to the other, kind of like floss. For a good example, check out this &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@flaircontentbyamber/video/7171688313349246213?lang=en&amp;amp;q=brain%20flossing&amp;amp;t=1740061816249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;link from TikTok creator @flaircontentbyamber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have anxiety, ruminating thoughts, or distracting &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/20-facts-about-adhd-no-one-ever-tells-you-17907406" class="T3D"&gt;symptoms of ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, then you might experience an immediate sense of calm while listening to bilateral music — and that’s all part of its appeal. Under @flaircontentbyamber’s video, one person said, “Why did this make me start crying? Pure relief.” Another wrote, “It quiets my ADHD and lets me focus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creator @living.withadhd also &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@livingwith.adhd/video/7142143766491598085?lang=en&amp;amp;q=brain%20flossing&amp;amp;t=1740061816249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;posted a bilateral song&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s since gained nearly 500,000 likes. “I can literally feel it moving from one side of my brain to the other,” one person wrote in the comments. Another said, “This is the first time I’ve felt that flossing/pulling/tingling feeling in my frontal lobes. Weird but nice.” Here’s what to know about brain flossing, according to an expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Does “Brain Flossing” Feel So Good?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.charliehealth.com/author/dr-caroline-fenkel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Dr. Caroline Fenkel, LCSW&lt;/a&gt;, a therapist and chief clinical officer at &lt;a href="https://www.charliehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Charlie Health&lt;/a&gt;, bilateral music is designed to engage both the right and left hemispheres of your brain in a specific pattern that promotes relaxation, focus, and even emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rhythmic left-right stimulation helps calm the nervous system, similar to how bilateral stimulation is used in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5061320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;therapies like EMDR&lt;/a&gt; [eye movement desensitization and reprocessing],” she tells Bustle. “It supports emotional processing [...] making it easier to work through feelings without being overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why this type of music could lead to an emotional release, like a big sigh or a sob sesh, but it can also feel soothing when you’re stressed. As Fenkel says, it helps you feel relaxed because it quiets racing thoughts, and that’s why it can also prep your brain for rest. The bouncy nature of the music helps block out that incessant, internal chatter that might keep you up at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say this type of music immediately quiets their mind in a way they never thought possible, “similar to the effects of &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/deep-breathing-exercises-can-help-with-insomnia-according-to-experts-heres-how-to-do-them-15826460" class="T3D"&gt;meditation or deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;,” says Fenkel. “Some research suggests it may also influence brainwave activity, shifting the brain into a calmer state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Best Times To Brain Floss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the mood to chill, pull up a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=bilateral%20music&amp;amp;t=1740078890515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;bilateral song on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; or YouTube. While it’s best to listen with headphones, you can also hold your phone horizontally in front of you to get the same effect as the track bounces between your phone’s speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can listen anytime, anywhere, even if you don’t have &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/what-its-like-to-be-on-medication-for-anxiety-and-adhd" class="T3D"&gt;anxiety or ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. “Anyone can listen to bilateral music,” says Fenkel. “It’s a simple, non-invasive tool that can support focus, relaxation, and emotional regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try it while &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-deal-with-travel-anxiety-during-the-holidays-according-to-science-13201169" class="T3D"&gt;traveling to soothe anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, while studying to block out annoying noises, or before bed when you want to keep your brain nice and quiet so you can quickly nod off. “Some people also use it during meditation or mindfulness practices to deepen relaxation,” she says.

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; — will not meet for its regularly scheduled February meeting, a senior HHS official confirmed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was to meet from Feb. 26 to 28, its first gathering since the Trump administration took office. That will not happen, Andrew Nixon, the HHS director of communications, told STAT in an email. Later on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a notice&lt;/a&gt; of the postponement was posted on the ACIP’s homepage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nixon did not directly answer STAT’s query of when the meeting would be held instead, saying only that it is “upcoming.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, whose first day at HHS was Tuesday, has denounced the ACIP in the past. During his &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/29/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-analysis-kennedy-diagnoses-problems-but-fails-with-remedies/"&gt;Senate confirmation process&lt;/a&gt;, he told the Finance Committee that 97% of ACIP members had conflicts of interest — a claim that people familiar with the rigorous vetting process ACIP members undergo have refuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CDC staff that organizes the committee’s work has for weeks been trying to get final approval from HHS to hold the meeting, without success. Until last week, the subcommittees or work groups that do the preparatory work for meetings of the full committee had been barred from meeting due to the c&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administration-orders-health-communications-pause-cdc-hhs-fda/"&gt;ommunications “pause” the administration placed on federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt; soon after President Trump’s inauguration. The subcommittee meetings were allowed to resume last week, multiple sources told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For a time, the CDC thought the ACIP meeting could take place, and in person on the agency’s campus, though plans were recently made to shift it to an online session as the secretariat waited for final approval to convene the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The meeting — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the agenda&lt;/a&gt; for which has been online since early January — was to be held to discuss multiple vaccine issues, and to vote on recommendations for the use of a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-prevent-disease-caused-chikungunya-virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;newly approved vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to prevent chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease; a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/02/18/fda-hhs-trump-zoetis-vaccines-gsk-sanofi-novo-insulin-rna-africa-roche-moderna-uk-michigan/"&gt;new meningitis vaccine from GSK&lt;/a&gt;, to be marketed as Penmenvy; as well as new recommendations on influenza and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All advisory committee meetings where votes will take place must have a period for public comment. Members of the public can submit written comments, or ask to enter a lottery to be allowed to make a verbal comment during the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But because HHS would not formally authorize the meeting to proceed, the portal through which public comments would be submitted was not opened. Sources said that this was the final trigger for the decision of the CDC’s ACIP secretariat to ask to postpone the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nixon said in his brief email that the meeting would be “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have been concerned about the future of this committee, which for years has helped the CDC decide how to use approved vaccines most effectively. Vaccines that are recommended by the ACIP must be covered by health insurance, if the CDC director signs off on its recommendations. CDC directors have rarely rejected those recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly two dozen groups of medical professionals and issue advocacy groups, including the American Medical Association, the Gerontological Society of America, and a range of individual medical professionals and public health experts wrote &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to Kennedy and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez urging them to promptly reschedule the meeting. The campaign is being spearheaded by the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Law San Francisco who follows the work of the ACIP closely, called the postponement “problematic in several ways,” noting that there were important votes set to be held.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reiss also said the move “raises suspicions that Mr. Kennedy will not keep his word to Senator [Bill] Cassidy that he will not interfere with ACIP recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a supporter of vaccines, was clearly hesitant to support Kennedy because of his controversial opinions about the safety of vaccines, which &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/rfk-jr-vaccines-autism-confirmation-hearing/"&gt;Kennedy refused to walk back during his Senate confirmation process&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy agreed to support Kennedy, however, after receiving &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;a list of assurances&lt;/a&gt;, including that Kennedy would “work within current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems, and uphold the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee recommendations.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts expressed concern that this postponement is a harbinger of the possible dissolution of the committee — at least in its present form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that Project 2025, a set of policy recommendations that was led by the conservative Heritage Foundation and that is seen by some as a playbook for Trump’s second term, states that CDC officials should not be allowed to make recommendations regarding vaccination requirements for school entry; those decisions should be left to parents and medical providers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s what this is. This is step 1 of trying to eliminate CDC as a group that makes [vaccine] recommendations,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ACIP plays several roles. It sometimes advises on which vaccines can be administered together safely. At other times the committee explores signals of risk to vaccine recipients to see whether use recommendations ought to be altered. Concerns about the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, a form of temporary paralysis, following receipt of two of the RSV vaccines for older adults led the committee to recommend &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/cdc-rsv-acip-hearing/"&gt;much more restrictive use&lt;/a&gt; of the products than manufacturers would have liked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fears about the committee’s future were only amplified when Trump signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday titled “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy.” One section of the order instructs aides to review existing federal advisory committees — ACIP is one — and report within 30 days on which should be terminated “on [the] grounds that they are unnecessary.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A CDC source told STAT that the agency was asked Wednesday to provide written justification for the existence of several federal advisory committees that operate under its aegis. There are roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/faca/committees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;20 federal advisory committees&lt;/a&gt; that advise the CDC on topics ranging from the incidence of breast cancer in young women to injury prevention and mine safety. Members of these committees &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/apply-for-membership/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are not paid employees&lt;/a&gt;, but receive travel expenses and, at least in the case of the ACIP, may be offered a $250 honorarium for the days on which they attend ACIP meetings, when they are designated as “special government employees.” Members are not paid for the time they spend on the work groups that do the bulk of the committee’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a significant development for pancreatic cancer treatment, a phase 1 clinical trial has highlighted the potential of personalized mRNA vaccines to treat the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research comes at a critical time, as pancreatic cancer is known for its grim prognosis, with less than 13% of patients surviving beyond five years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease is often diagnosed at advanced stages due to a lack of early symptoms and routine screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pancreatic-cancer-woes"&gt;Pancreatic cancer woes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is particularly challenging because around 90% of cases are found when they are already advanced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nature of this cancer often allows it to spread to other parts of the body before it can be effectively treated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are limited in their ability to cure the disease, which has led researchers to seek innovative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vinod Balachandran, who leads the Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, expressed the urgent need for new options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite advancements in treatments for other cancers, pancreatic cancer remains largely resistant, with a survival rate that has stagnated around 10% even following the best available therapies,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the COVID-19 pandemic popularized mRNA technology, researchers already explored its potential for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This innovative approach educates the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The technology is also being tested for other types of cancer, such as melanoma and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For an mRNA vaccine to be effective, it must generate a strong response from T cells, a type of immune cell that combats infections and diseases. These T cells must remain active over time to fight cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While training T cells to attack viruses is comparatively straightforward, teaching them to target cells the body has created is considerably more complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge is particularly pronounced in pancreatic cancer. For a vaccine to successfully prompt the immune system to identify tumor cells, there &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;must&lt;/a&gt; be unique targets present on those cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells develop from mutations, and these mutations can &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/pancreatic-cancer-dna-study" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;serve&lt;/a&gt; as targets. However, pancreatic tumors generally have fewer mutations available, leading to skepticism about the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines for this cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-mrna-vaccine-may-extend-life-by-8-to-10-years"&gt;New mRNA vaccine may extend life by 8 to 10 years&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent trial aimed to test this assumption by exploring the efficacy of personalized mRNA vaccines in a group with operable pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was a follow-up study to an initial trial conducted earlier in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 trials are designed to assess safety and initial effectiveness, and this new study included 16 patients whose tumors could be surgically removed—a rare situation, as only about 20% of pancreatic cancers are operable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to surgical treatment, these participants were given personalized mRNA vaccines tailored to their tumor profiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers monitored the patients for up to four years after tumor removal, assessing the vaccine’s ability to stimulate an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results showed that half of the participants—eight out of 16—responded positively to the vaccine, producing T cells capable of targeting their tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other half did not show any measurable response. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among those who responded, the vaccine appeared to &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/new-blood-test-pancreatic-cancer" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;significantly&lt;/a&gt; prolong the lifespan of the T cells, with estimates suggesting they could last nearly eight years in the body and around 20% of these cells may persist and function for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that the mRNA vaccine may not only activate an immune response but could potentially enhance the longevity of T cells, crucial for long-term protection &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; cancer recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this study marks a promising step forward in the fight against pancreatic cancer, it remains one of the first stages of research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further trials will be necessary to evaluate mRNA vaccines’ effectiveness and broader applicability in treating this challenging cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to better digestion, maintaining a healthy gut can also have positive effects on your immune system, mental health, weight and energy levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors affect gut health. However, the #1 habit to promote a healthy and diverse gut microbiome is by eating a diet that regularly contains probiotic-rich foods. We spoke with dietitians to better understand why probiotics matter and how they benefit your digestive system. We also asked them to share practical tips for adding probiotic-rich foods to your diet and other strategies to help your gut thrive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-eating-probiotic-foods-regularly-is-the-1-habit-to-promote-better-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Eating Probiotic Foods Regularly Is the #1 Habit to Promote Better Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that naturally reside in your gut. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;found in fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; like yogurt, kombucha and kimchi. From better digestion to a stronger immune system, let’s take a closer look at some benefits of eating more probiotic-rich foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotics Can Help Support Digestive Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, collectively known as the gut microbiome. A balanced and varied microbiome is important for maintaining digestive health. &lt;a href="http://www.simplywellnessllc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sammy Peterson, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and holistic health expert at Simply Wellness says that studies have found probiotics to be important for digestion, reducing inflammation and promoting overall gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find probiotics in supplements, but research suggests that getting them from whole foods is especially beneficial. A 2021 study found that eating foods like yogurt, kefir and kimchi helped increase gut bacteria diversity and reduce inflammation—key markers of good gut health—in healthy adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotics May Enhance Immune Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Did you know that approximately 70-80% of your immune system resides in your gut? A well-balanced microbiome, supported by probiotics in our diet, can help regulate immune responses and protect against pathogens, like viruses. “[Probiotics] can help restore the balance of the gut microbiota, by counteracting disruptions from antibiotics, infections and stress while naturally crowding out harmful microbes,” says Peterson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://nicoleibarrard.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Ibarra, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, media registered dietitian and owner of Altitude Nutrition &amp;amp; Fitness also emphasizes this connection, saying that studies have found probiotics and fermented foods to play a key role in supporting immune function and helping the body fight off infections.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotics May Support Mental Health and Memory &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The gut and brain are intricately connected through something called the “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001367/poor-gut-health-increases-anxiety-depression-risk-what-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;.” Preliminary research suggests that probiotics can influence this connection, potentially improving cognitive function and mood and may even help manage some mental health conditions like depression, anxiety disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Additionally, a small study in healthy adults found that drinking a fermented probiotic beverage daily for 4 weeks was associated with significant improvements in memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research is ongoing, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding kefir to your morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt; could be an easy and nutritious way to boost your mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-to-incorporate-more-probiotic-foods-into-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips to Incorporate More Probiotic Foods into Your Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding probiotics to your routine doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are some simple tips to get started:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small. &lt;/strong&gt;Peterson suggests starting with simple additions, like a small serving of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-sauerkraut-good-for-you-8729233" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; or kimchi, with meals, or sipping on kombucha in place of soda. Ibarra adds that yogurt and kefir are great starter options since their mild flavors make them easy to blend into smoothies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Daily Habit. &lt;/strong&gt;Consistency is key, so try to find a sustainable way to enjoy probiotics every day. Prep &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-snack-for-more-energy-8776152" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;yogurt parfaits for an afternoon snack&lt;/a&gt;, or enjoy a glass of kefir with breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir In Some Miso&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7958146/what-is-miso-and-how-do-i-use-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Miso, a fermented soybean paste&lt;/a&gt;, is an easy way to add probiotics to savory dishes. “Stir miso into soups, stews, chili or dressings for an extra gut-friendly boost,” recommends Peterson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Labels Carefully.&lt;/strong&gt; When buying probiotic foods, look for phrases like “live and active cultures” on the label. When possible, opt for refrigerated versions, as shelf-stable fermented foods are often pasteurized, which kills the beneficial bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-improve-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Improve Gut Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While probiotics are great for your gut, they’re just one part of the equation for a healthy digestive system. Here are a few additional habits to consider:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Plenty of Prebiotic Foods.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; are non-digestible fibers that feed the good bacteria in your gut. You can find them in a variety of plant-based foods like garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas and oats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to prebiotics, eating more total fiber supports digestion and overall gut health.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A simple way to do this is by incorporating a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables into your meals throughout the week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving.&lt;/strong&gt; “Engaging in regular physical activity as part of your everyday routine, even as simple as a 15-minute walk, can help enhance gut bacteria diversity,” says Peterson. Exercise also helps reduce inflammation, which Peterson says can support optimal gut barrier function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Consistent Eating Pattern. &lt;/strong&gt;Ibarra suggests spacing meals 3 to 4 hours apart to keep your digestive system running smoothly. “When you skip meals or go several hours without eating, it slows your digestive system down, which can lead to constipation and other digestive symptoms,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi to your diet is a simple and flavorful way to nourish your gut. Not only are probiotic-rich foods important for your digestive system, but they may also help strengthen your immune system and even boost your mood. Pairing these foods with other healthy habits like eating fiber-rich foods, not skipping meals and engaging in physical activity can set the stage for a happy, healthy gut.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

AUGUST 06: A view of the sign of Center for Disease Control headquarters is seen &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; in Atlanta, Georgia, United States .

&lt;p&gt;The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has terminated a successful flu vaccination campaign educating the public on the efficacy and benefits of flu vaccines, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" aria-label="NPR"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign, which uses infographics by depicting wild animals next to more tame animals, seeks to promote awareness on how immunization can help protect individuals from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" aria-label="webpage"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has now been archived, although some information on the flu vaccination campaign can still be found &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html" aria-label="online"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html"&gt;online&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The HHS had allegedly reviewed the campaign and decided it would not continue, as reported in NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the campaign is to inform the general public that vaccines still provide the best protection against the common flu. Although vaccines do not necessarily prevent the flu and individuals can certainly get the flu even after vaccination, the rate of complications like infection of the lung are significantly diminished, and symptoms from flu for those vaccinated tend to be much milder when compared to those who get the flu and are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of this important campaign could not come at a more inopportune time. Flu cases are the highest they have been in the last decade, with at least 29 million flu illnesses this season, 370,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message also remains indispensable given the current Texas measles outbreak, with 58 reported cases. Although the majority of cases have been reported in those unvaccinated, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html" aria-label="four individuals"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;four individuals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; claim that they have received the measles vaccine. The flu vaccination campaign would help educate people on a common question- why are people who are vaccinated getting measles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timely infographic demonstrates that immunization does not necessarily prevent individuals from getting the infection, but rather provides protection and makes symptoms more tame or mild. This critical information is necessary so the public understands the efficacy of vaccines and why vaccinated patients can still get infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminating the campaign also comes at a time when thousands of probationary workers in the most influential federal health care sectors have been laid off, including personnel at the HHS, NIH and CDC. As I explained recently in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/" target="_self" aria-label="Forbes"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these public health experts are critical in protecting and safeguarding health for Americans and individuals all around the world. These workers have been instrumental in carrying out groundbreaking research that have helped discover cures and vaccines. They have been indispensable in containing deadly infectious diseases, in developing key tests that help us identify various diseases and help communicate important public health information so all of us can stay safe and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It has been only one month into the Trump presidency, and science and public health have been under constant fire. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/" target="_self" aria-label="Foreign aid"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/"&gt;Foreign aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help fight important diseases like Malaria, TB and HIV has been curtailed. Trump’s Secretary for Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed by the Senate, a well-known vaccine skeptic that has repeatedly spread misinformation that vaccines cause autism. And now, vital public health information is being taken down from websites, threatening the public’s ability to understand public health and make important informed decisions about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 represents a time of enormous public health challenges, from threats of the bird flu, to the common flu surging to outbreaks of Measles and Ebola being reported across the globe. This is not a time for putting the brakes on public health. If anything, the Trump administration should be putting their foot on the accelerator to ensure there is adequate staff to address all these public health issues. If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that there must be transparency and a wealth of important information accessible to everyone so people can make decisions to protect themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing healthcare personnel and purging public health websites will do nobody any good.&lt;/p&gt;

The primary cause of death during a cocaine overdose is stroke or cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since its heyday in the 1980s, the rate of cocaine overdose deaths nationwide has varied widely over the years.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But around 2015, the year in which Dr Palamar and his colleagues say the fourth wave of the drug crisis kicked off, cocaine deaths rose precipitously.

&lt;p&gt;A painful burning sensation in a woman's legs turned out to be the result of a parasite burrowing into her brain, her doctors have revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old, from New England, likely contracted the parasite while travelling in Hawaii, according to a case report published Feb. 13 in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms began with a strange burning sensation in her feet. Over the coming days, the pain spread up her legs, and the impacted areas became sensitive to even the lightest touch. She was also fatigued, but she initially attributed that to jet lag following a three-week trip to Thailand, Japan and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to an emergency department about the sensations in her legs, but her exams came back normal and she was ultimately discharged. Days later, the sensations spread to her truck and arms and she developed a headache. So she went to a second emergency department, and again, her exams were "reportedly normal," although her immune-cell count was up. She received medications that relieved her headache before being discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 scary parasitic diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about a week of these symptoms, the woman developed confusion and her partner brought her to hospital once again. Her blood tests and kidney function were still normal, and microscopic examination of her blood showed no obvious signs of parasites. However, one thing that did stand out was an elevated level of a type of white blood cell called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; these cells help the body fight off foreign invaders, including parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team then performed a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to draw out a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid surrounds the spinal cord and brain. This test also revealed a very high level of eosinophils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her results were consistent with a condition known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/parasitic-meningitis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/parasitic-meningitis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophilic meningitis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a rare form of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord often caused by parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the case report, the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis is rat lungworm (&lt;em&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis), &lt;/em&gt;a parasite that lives in many tropical and subtropical regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ruling out other culprits, the team determined &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; was behind the woman's case. While the parasite was not detected in the patient's blood, further testing of her cerebrospinal fluid revealed genetic traces of the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adult form of the parasite primarily lives inside rodents. Their larvae then pass out through the rodent's feces, at which point they are eaten by slugs and snails. These larvae mature inside the mollusks until their host is eventually eaten by a rat or other rodent, and the life cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a human eats an infected mollusk that's raw or undercooked, or a raw vegetable that has been contaminated with their slime, they can also become infected. Shellfish, including land crabs and freshwater prawns, may also become contaminated if they eat an infected slug or snail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all people who ingest &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; experience symptoms, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/angiostrongylus/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/angiostrongylus/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, in some cases the larvae migrate to the host's central nervous system and reach the brain — in some lab animals, this can happen within four hours of ingestion, the case report notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the human brain, the parasite can trigger headaches, a stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, tingling or burning sensations and eventually, seizures and vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; infections resolve on their own as the parasites die off, even in cases of meningitis, the CDC says. In those cases, supportive treatments might include painkillers and antiinflammatories. That said, these infections can sometimes be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the woman's case, the patient was given a 14-day course of antiparasitic medication, together with a steroid drug to help bring down inflammation in her nervous system. She was discharged from hospital after six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent infection with rat lungworms like &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; , the CDC recommends that people not eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs, shrimp or prawns. They should wear gloves and wash hands after handling snails or slugs in the garden. The agency also adds that people should always wash fresh produce thoroughly and avoid eating uncooked vegetables in areas where the parasite is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN-AN2HkijRUkVUv0xCkRcg6S5KwqMbn4yU" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN-AN2HkijRUkVUv0xCkRcg6S5KwqMbn4yU slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48000"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48001"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48002"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths.

But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPTExxTFI5RVA0MVJjcExqbHJsa0Eyc21WLXBhOUVJVFdyazVoajdHUHU4Q3V3enA5ZktMN2pHYndSOEVMcE4tZ2FBRG9yRXhIbVdoYXl0cXVuSWRlU0xDMmxBUDdybldrTUYycXFFOHg4NFN2M1NGX1JDZktDeXFUUy0tNHVzeEpYUUFVTDB2VmNRZlRkNHc</guid></item><item><title>A CDC vaccine committee meeting, the first of Kennedy's tenure at HHS, gets postponed - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORTBXS01rRmwzZlNzbXBZMU5qYnZnd0Z0TjVtYmFBRlBJZ0F4a0lMS0JxRUt2aG5FOFBuc1VvYUFIUTNNcFVOUHZ5V2YtTk8zTWdGdG1IWTNfd253MFVlbmtjTkJwX0Y4cGx4Q0VwcWFUbW44SDJCVndFT0hZZUFlREl2UkN4Ri1KX3ExTzVzV1dzUTlGV2paWjEtUC1iQjRBdnlfU1pqd3TSAVZBVV95cUxQZ1BiMFJENndmanJBMkZCRFlnR1pkcE5xSzU5N3gzdWx0RUlUM0RQSzRTRDhDanlocExfelV1X25hR1pYaWtKZXF1b0RxUWEzclNrX3FmZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for next week — the first since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandresults" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Identification of First Case and Public Health Notification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the index cat (cat 1A, one of three cats in household 1), aged 5 years, exclusively indoor, spayed female domestic shorthair, experienced decreased appetite, lack of grooming, disorientation, and lethargy, followed by progressive neurologic deterioration. On the second day of illness, the cat was evaluated at a local veterinary clinic; on the fourth day, the cat was referred to the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Medical Center (VMC), a tertiary care facility with advanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities where, because of rapid disease progression, cat 1A was euthanized. Because the cat’s owner had known occupational exposure to dairy cattle, and because highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus was known to be circulating in dairy cattle on Michigan dairy farms, upon approval from the state veterinarian, cat 1A’s remains were submitted to MSU’s veterinary diagnostic laboratory (VDL) for necropsy. Brain and nasal swabs tested by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were positive for influenza A(H5) virus.* Genetic sequencing results identified HPAI A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the sequencing results; the virus was indistinguishable from viruses circulating in Michigan dairy cattle&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). This identification of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in a domestic house cat resulted in initiation of a public health investigation by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MDHHS/MMDHD). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Investigation and Public Health Response — Household 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat 1A lived in a household with two adults, one of whom worked on a dairy farm in a county known to have HPAI A(H5N1)–positive dairy cattle; two adolescents (adolescents 1A and 1B); and two other exclusively indoor cats (cats 1B and 1C) (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Cat 1B was reported to have signs of watery, purulent eye discharge, increased respirations, and decreased appetite 4 days after onset of illness in cat 1A. MSU VMC requested that the owner obtain a swab from cat 1B because the cat was too ill to be taken into the clinic, but specimens were not submitted by the owner. Cat 1B’s illness signs were reported to have resolved 11 days after cat 1A’s illness onset. Cat 1C had no signs of illness when it arrived at MSU VMC and received negative test results for influenza A 11 days after cat 1A’s illness onset. No other indoor or outdoor pets were reported. All four household members had daily contact with all three cats in the home. Although the dairy farm where the adult household member worked was not known to be affected by HPAI A(H5N1) virus, it was located near other affected farms.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; This dairy farmworker did not work directly with animals but worked on the dairy farm premises. The worker reported removing work clothes and boots outside when returning to the household; these items were then brought to a location in the home that was not accessible to the cats. The cats and household members did not consume unpasteurized milk or milk products.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical examination of cat 1A by veterinary staff members was notable for signs of severe neurologic disease (obtundation, abnormality of cranial nerves, and abnormal motor function in all four limbs), anorexia, and lethargy. The cat initially had signs of ataxia, decreased appetite, swollen right jaw, abnormal gait, and hiding behavior. Some improvement and return of appetite occurred on day 3, 1 day after the cat received subcutaneous antibiotics. However, on day 4, it could not hold up its head, had an unsteady gait, and displayed all initial signs again; the cat was euthanized on day 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected from three household 1 members (the non farmworker adult and the two adolescents) 11 days after onset of illness in cat 1A; specimens were sent to MDHHS, where they tested negative for influenza A viruses by RT-PCR. The dairy farmworker declined influenza testing. Only one of the three persons tested (adolescent 1A, who had no comorbidities) experienced signs or symptoms of illness (cough, sore throat, headache, and myalgia), which began 6 days after illness onset in cat 1A). The household 1 members who received testing received a 10-day course of twice-daily oral oseltamivir as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) at the time of testing; the dairy farmworker declined testing and PEP.&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; Adolescent 1B reported a “dry croupy” cough 6 days after onset of illness in cat 1A that was attributed to severe allergies. Communication with public health representatives ended before final resolution of adolescent 1B’s symptoms was reported. Only adolescent 1A received any positive laboratory test result; this test was for rhinovirus/enterovirus on a multiplex PCR BioFire Film Array Respiratory Panel at MDHHS. Cat 1A’s owner, the dairy farmworker, had regular contact with cat 1A and adolescent 1A; the farmworker reported 1 day of vomiting and diarrhea that preceded onset of illness in cat 1A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Investigation and Public Health Response — Household 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six days after referral of cat 1A to MSU VMC, cat 2A, an exclusively indoor intact male Maine Coon cat aged 6 months from a second household (household 2), was brought by its owner directly to MSU VMC with a 1-day history of progressive neurologic deterioration, anorexia, lethargy, and facial swelling. On initial physical examination of cat 2A, it was found to be obtunded, with abnormalities of cranial nerve function, abnormal motor function, puffiness of the eyes and nose, and minimal movement; the cat died within 24 hours of onset of illness signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat 2A lived with one additional indoor cat (cat 2B) and its owner, a dairy farmworker. Nasal swabs from cat 2A tested by RT-PCR at MSU VDL, 1 day after onset of cat 2A’s illness signs and upon initial examination, were positive for influenza A viruses and were confirmed as HPAI A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 at the United States Department of Agriculture’s NVSL. Cat 2B did not show any signs of illness, and nasal swabs tested negative for influenza A viruses. Cat 2A’s owner transported unpasteurized milk from various farms in a Michigan county that included farms with dairy cattle confirmed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus and lived in the same county where cat 1A’s owner lived. Cat 2A’s owner did not wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling raw milk; reported frequent milk splash exposures to the face, eyes, and clothing; and did not remove work clothing before entering the home when returning from work. Cat 2A’s owner reported that cat 2A would roll in the owner’s work clothes, whereas cat 2B did not exhibit this behavior. Cat 2A’s owner experienced eye irritation that began 2 days before the onset of illness signs in cat 2A but reported no other symptoms. The owner did not receive testing for influenza and declined oseltamivir and further contact with public health officials, stating fear of losing employment as a consequence of communicating with public health officials and implicating farms that provided milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Screening and Testing of Veterinary Staff Members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veterinary staff members who handled the infected cats at the local veterinary practice or MSU VMC were contacted and enrolled by public health authorities for 10 days of symptom monitoring after their last exposure to the cats. Overall, 24 veterinary staff members, including one veterinarian, five nurses, three technicians, five assistants, two caregivers, three interns, and five students, were potentially exposed to the two ill cats; 18 (75%) were contacted and monitored, but because of their limited exposure, they were not offered PEP.&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; PPE protocols are in place for all patients managed in MSU VMC’s isolation unit, where the cats were treated and in laboratory units where specimens were tested. For HPAI A(H5N1), recommended PPE include a Tyvek suit, boot covers, nitrile gloves, a surgical head cover, and a face mask. Veterinary staff members were reported to likely wear surgical masks for the initial encounter of cat 1A and N95 masks thereafter. Varying levels of PPE use were reported by veterinary staff members, which ranged from only using gloves to following full protocol. Laboratory staff members wear either powered air-purifying respirators or N95 respirators. Among seven persons who reported signs or symptoms after exposure to the ill cats, including four who reported nasal congestion and three who reported headache, five agreed to testing; all received negative influenza A RT-PCR test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="bg-gray-l2 col-md-9 float-left mb-3 order-0 "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke is a complex mixture of gases and airborne particulate matter; urban fires and conventional wildfires emit different air pollutants. The Atmospheric Science and Chemistry mEasurement NeTwork (ASCENT), a new, advanced air quality measurement network, provides real-time measurements of the chemical constituents in fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the January 2025 Los Angeles fires, ASCENT recorded an approximate 110-fold increase in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead levels compared with values from the previous few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban fires emit air pollutants that pose risks different from those of conventional wildfires. It is important for epidemiologic studies to consider PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5 &lt;/sub&gt;composition when assessing the impacts of urban fire smoke exposure. Health officials should communicate protective measures to the public (monitor air quality forecasts and follow guidance by local emergency management officials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 7, 2025, the Eaton Canyon and Palisades fires blazed across the Los Angeles region, driven by exceptionally dry conditions and Santa Ana wind gusts approaching 100 mph (161 kph). The fires spread rapidly into densely populated neighborhoods along the wildland-urban interface, destroying approximately 16,000 structures. As of February 10, 2025, a total of 29 deaths had been identified.* In addition to the deaths and destruction of property, wildfires emit a complex mixture of air pollutants and contribute to elevated concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;; particulate matter with a diameter &amp;lt;2.5 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;m), degrading air quality many miles downwind. Exposure to wildfire PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; has been linked to adverse health effects including increased asthma cases, respiratory symptoms, aggravated respiratory diseases, and increased overall mortality (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;–&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;). Unlike conventional wildfires that primarily burn natural fuels (e.g., grasslands or forests), the Eaton Canyon and Palisades fires ignited significant portions of the built environment, in which painted surfaces, pipes, vehicles, plastics, electronic equipment, and the structures themselves became the fuel. This widespread combustion of synthetic materials has increased concerns about the toxicity of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, because a large proportion of the structures affected by the fires were built before 1978, when use of leaded paint was still common. This report focused on measuring airborne PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead during the Los Angeles urban fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandoutcomes" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Outcomes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atmospheric Science and Chemistry mEasurement NeTwork (ASCENT)&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; is a new, nationwide, multi-institutional initiative funded by the National Science Foundation, to provide continuous measurements of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; chemical components (organics, inorganics, metals, and black carbon) across 12 sites in the United States, including seven urban and five remote or rural areas.&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; All ASCENT sites were operating and sampling ambient air as of May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles ASCENT site in Pico Rivera, approximately 14 miles (23 kilometers) south of the Eaton Canyon fire, has been operating since July 2023. During and immediately after the Los Angeles fires, southward winds transported the fire plume to the ASCENT site. Hourly PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead measurements recorded during and after the fires were reviewed to assess their contribution to atmospheric lead levels. Because this analysis consists of a review of routinely collected environmental data and does not include human subjects, human subjects review was not required by the authors’ institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During January 2–6, 2025, the average PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration recorded at the Los Angeles ASCENT site was 0.00068 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. From January 8 to January 11, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration increased approximately 110 times with an average concentration of 0.077 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Recorded PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration peaked at approximately 0.5 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on January 9. By the evening of January 11, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration had returned to levels similar to those before the fire. The presence of heavy metals such as lead is not unusual in urban fire emissions, particularly in California, where legacy pollutants from older infrastructure, industrial sources, and soils can be remobilized during fires (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;). For example, during the 2018 Camp fire, monitors recorded ambient PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5 &lt;/sub&gt;lead concentrations that averaged 0.13 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; during a period of 17 hours (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few data illustrate the health effects of lead from inhalation compared with other exposure routes. The ASCENT real-time measurements of airborne lead and other chemical constituents in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; provide valuable PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; chemical composition data that can be combined with health data to examine health effects of individual smoke components from the Los Angeles fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="preliminaryconclusionsandactions" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Preliminary Conclusions and Actions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preliminary Conclusions and Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead is a toxic air contaminant that is distributed in multiple human tissues and accumulates in teeth and bones; it affects nearly every organ system, posing significant health risks, particularly for children, who are more vulnerable to its neurodevelopmental effects (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). Regulatory efforts, especially the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, have resulted in a sharp decline in airborne lead levels during the past 45 years.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; The current National Ambient Air Quality Standard for lead in total suspended particles over a 3-month rolling average is 0.15 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.** Measures including removing lead from gasoline and leaded pipes and the banning or limiting of lead in consumer products, such as residential paint, have led to a 97% decrease in airborne lead concentrations in the United States since 1980 (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). However, unlike chronic lead exposure, which has been widely studied, the health effects of brief, elevated lead exposures, such as those described in this report, are not well understood. Additional health research is needed, because airborne lead levels alone do not necessarily indicate exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is not a single entity but comprises a complex mixture of chemical components with dynamic size distributions, temporal and spatial variations, and toxicity. Whereas the health effects of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure are well documented, studies assessing which sources, chemical compounds, and sizes of particles contribute to health effects are lacking. ASCENT fills in this gap by providing high time-resolution and chemical composition measurements of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; across dynamic size ranges with advanced air quality measurement technologies. The new availability of real-time measurements of the many chemical constituents in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, and time-resolved particle size distributions in diverse U.S. locations, has the capacity to improve understanding of health effects associated with particulate matter exposure and contribute to building a foundation for protecting public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

However, new research has suggested that the current recommended levels may not be sufficient to prevent cognitive impairment, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from UC San Francisco, published in Annals of Neurology, found that even older individuals with so-called healthy levels of B12, showed signs of cognitive decline and brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Vitamin B12 is associated with maintaining cognitive health and preventing neurological issues as we get older, there is a need to revise the healthy range as it may not be enough to maintain older people's brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study published in Annals of Neurology, older, healthy volunteers, with low levels of B12, but still in the normal range, displayed signs of neurological and cognitive deficiency. The levels are currently considered healthy but low enough to cause damage to the brain’s white matter – the nerve fibres that enable communication between areas of the brain. The older adults with these levels got test scores associated with slower cognitive and visual processing speeds, compared to those with higher B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms,” said senior author Ari J. Green, MD, of the UCSF Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia. “Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment with an average age of 71 were involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their Vitamin B12 levels averaged 414.8 pmol/L, which is well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers considered the biologically active component of B12, which provides a clearer picture of how much vitamin the body can utilise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the cognitive test, participants with lower active B12 levels had slower processing speed, which indicated subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. Such participants also showed significant delays in responding to visual stimuli, which pointed to slower visual processing speeds and sluggish brain conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MRIs also showed a higher volume of lesions in the white matter of the participants which could be linked with cognitive decline, dementia or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to redefining B12 deficiency, clinicians should consider supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits,” Co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said. “Ultimately, we need to invest in more research about the underlying biology of B12 insufficiency, since it may be a preventable cause of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Research finds popular dietary supplement can cause cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>'A stiff breeze could have blown him over' | 9NEWS Investigates: The arrest and death of Jim Purdy - 9News.com KUSA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxQcVR2V1BYcV9lNXlVa1otVXU1eWtucVduVmdkWEJHLUtpM3ZaNVNYN3ZMSVVEN3J2RjQ4YVo1SFJTYkMyVWZ3TVY3dU0xYVctczBwZ281V2lCdVNXWG50S3BhSUtqLVBsZkg0MlBXc3h1dzhUWEVEZ3RwN1ZSdVZwNUVLdEhES01sNEdJXy1pU1FIaWRJU01Lb0d2RTNzYVI2Zl9iZGUxMGNWZloxT3RNd2txb3Nqd0JyVUl1QlUxYnFlX29FSmtYUU50bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

However, post-vaccination, a few reported some side effects such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus, and dizziness. A recent study by Yale researchers has delved deep into this little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study posted online, the researchers have characterized this condition and also studied the immunological patterns that differentiate those with PVS from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and co-senior author of the study published Feb. 19 as a preprint on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; said in a release. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic symptoms of PVS include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excessive fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;brain fog&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insomnia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms develop shortly after vaccination, which is within a day or two, and can get more severe in the days that follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” Harlan Krumholz, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at YSM and co-senior author of the study adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed blood samples from people in their Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) study to understand long COVID and post-vaccine syndrome (PVS). They compared 42 people with PVS symptoms to 22 people without symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found differences in immune cells between the two groups. Those with PVS had lower levels of effector CD4+ T cells and higher levels of TNF-alpha+ CD8 T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found differences in antibody levels. People with PVS who never had COVID-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the virus's spike protein. This was likely because they received fewer vaccine doses than those without PVS. With fewer shots and no prior infection, their immune systems had less chance to build protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they found that some people with PVS had higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, even if they had never been infected. Normally, the spike protein stays in the body for only a few days after vaccination, but in some PVS cases, it was still present more than 700 days later. This lingering spike protein has also been linked to long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising, to find spike protein in circulation at such a late time point. We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS who didn’t have any measurable spike protein. But it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,” Iwasaki noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz further added that PVS might be similar to other infections that lead to chronic symptoms, each through different biological pathways. “One person might develop chronic symptoms due to immune dysregulation, while another experiences lingering effects from viral reactivation. We need to map these different pathways carefully to understand what is happening in each case. This work is just beginning, and further studies are essential to guide diagnosis and treatment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shakira's Health Crisis: Fans Rally Outside Hospital Following Her Statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers added that a deeper understanding of PVS is required to make better &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/seeing-the-invisible/does-the-estimate-of-154-million-lives-saved-by-vaccines-since-1974-stack-up/" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with fewer side effects. “For instance, if we can determine why spike protein is persisting for as long as it is in some people, maybe we can remove it — with monoclonal antibodies, for example — and maybe that could help reduce PVS symptoms,” Iwasaki adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Yale scientists link Covid vaccines to alarming new syndrome causing 'distinct biological changes - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogJBVV95cUxQYzNCWkJfRGdUM3N3cWNiWDZ4eVk1b09jdUVPU0tHODBuVTJocnJTY1NOQjNDeVVDR1F3dFQtTVFORVRSVTB2akFkWkh1RnRVbjlKUnlRTThXcE5KNVUtU01Bb1VxSmJyVEhkZkY5WHFTaFN5d0Fwc1g4Ymw3cHZGRTF1ZjAwT2VCUUxEYXhaRUFBNXJKUlpQZk1fVEhsZjY2ZEd0Q0lSRXJvTWhwTVI2QTFXVktZdDBWaGtBUl9qWDZiU3cwRzdCNGtSWHY2VDBlUlhQd0doU3BpN3pWTGt6eGlsUW1ibGI4R3BqbzlZR2lRbWJ1QW45UHBYcDhDTV85VXU3QXVkdllEV0tWMjFsbHhDS0NBRm1aSVNxX3RzeXBuUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in preventing millions of deaths during the pandemic. However, post-vaccination, a few reported some side effects such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus, and dizziness. A recent study by Yale researchers has delved deep into this little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study posted online, the researchers have characterized this condition and also studied the immunological patterns that differentiate those with PVS from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and co-senior author of the study published Feb. 19 as a preprint on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; said in a release. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic symptoms of PVS include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excessive fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;brain fog&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insomnia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms develop shortly after vaccination, which is within a day or two, and can get more severe in the days that follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” Harlan Krumholz, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at YSM and co-senior author of the study adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed blood samples from people in their Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) study to understand long COVID and post-vaccine syndrome (PVS). They compared 42 people with PVS symptoms to 22 people without symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found differences in immune cells between the two groups. Those with PVS had lower levels of effector CD4+ T cells and higher levels of TNF-alpha+ CD8 T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found differences in antibody levels. People with PVS who never had COVID-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the virus's spike protein. This was likely because they received fewer vaccine doses than those without PVS. With fewer shots and no prior infection, their immune systems had less chance to build protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they found that some people with PVS had higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, even if they had never been infected.

This finding is consistent with the expectation that the treatment increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2024.08.009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="444" data-end="816"&gt;Depression, or major depressive disorder, is one of the most common mental health conditions. It is characterized by persistent sadness, a loss of interest in activities, and emotional or physical symptoms that interfere with daily life. Treatment options include psychotherapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and social support, depending on the severity of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="818" data-end="1281"&gt;Drugs used to treat depression are called antidepressants. There are several types of antidepressants, each with a different mechanism of action. One frequently used type is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These drugs act on the systems in the brain that use the neurotransmitter serotonin (or 5-HT). It is believed that they increase the availability of serotonin in the brain, although more specific data on the mechanism of action are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1738"&gt;Study author Vibeke H. Dam and her colleagues aimed to explore whether the binding of serotonin to 5-HT4 receptors in patients with major depressive disorder is associated with cognitive and depressive symptoms following antidepressant treatment. They hypothesized that treatment with SSRIs would reduce the binding of serotonin to these receptors in the brain and that this change would be accompanied by changes in depressive symptoms and verbal memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1740" data-end="2112"&gt;The study included 100 participants who had not previously been treated with antidepressants. They were recruited from the mental health system in the capital region of Denmark and enrolled in the NeuroPharm depression study, an open, nonrandomized 12-week clinical trial. Participants were between 18 and 65 years old and exhibited moderate or severe depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2114" data-end="2687"&gt;Participants were assigned to take escitalopram, an SSRI, for 12 weeks, starting at doses of 10 to 20 mg/day. The initial dose was adjusted by clinicians as necessary. At the start of treatment, participants underwent positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their brains. These scans were repeated after eight weeks of treatment. Participants also completed a series of cognitive tests at the start of the study and after 12 weeks. Because many participants dropped out of the study, complete data were collected from only 39 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2689" data-end="2944"&gt;Results showed that the initial level of 5-HT4 receptor binding activity in the neocortex, neostriatum, and hippocampus was not associated with the participants’ response to antidepressant treatment (i.e., whether their symptoms improved and by how much).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2946" data-end="3302"&gt;However, 5-HT4 receptor binding activity decreased by 9% during the eight weeks of treatment in the neostriatum. There were no changes in 5-HT4 receptor binding activity in the neocortex or hippocampus. Interestingly, participants who experienced the smallest decrease in 5-HT4 receptor binding activity tended to show larger improvements in verbal memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3304" data-end="3571"&gt;The neostriatum is part of the basal ganglia and plays a role in mood regulation through its connections with the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. Dysfunctions in this region are linked to mood disorders such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initiation of antidepressant SSRI/SNRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors / serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors] treatment of otherwise untreated patients with MDD [major depressive disorder] induces a reduction in cerebral 5- HT4Rs that is consistent with increases in synaptic extracellular 5-HT [serotonin] independent of overall clinical response. However, the less it was reduced, the better patients performed on verbal memory tasks,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="4065" data-end="4480"&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. However, it should be noted that the study design does not allow for any causal inferences to be made. Because the study did not include a control group or any other type of control, it cannot be definitively concluded that the observed reductions in receptor activity were caused solely by the medications used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2024.08.009"&gt;Effect of Antidepressant Treatment on 5-HT4 Receptor Binding and Associations With Clinical Outcomes and Verbal Memory in Major Depressive Disorder,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Vibeke H.

&lt;p&gt;While sex is built into the very definition of an STI, experts caution that it is possible to contract one without getting it on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/14/health/stds-spike-in-nyc-alarming-health-data-shows-heres-why/"&gt;Sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt; — which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/prevalence-incidence-and-cost-estimates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;affect 1 in 5 Americans&lt;/a&gt; — are most commonly found on the genitals, anus and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2022/default.htm#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20more%20than%202.5,from%20all%20STI%20prevention%20partners." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, STI rates are on the rise, putting millions of people’s lives at risk from entirely preventable infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sexually transmitted infections — which affect 1 in 5 Americans — are most commonly found on the genitals, anus and mouth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fizkes – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“STIs must be a public health priority,” the CDC warned. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health agency noted that “the most alarming concerns” revolve around syphilis cases — which are at the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/31/lifestyle/syphilis-cases-soar-to-highest-level-in-70-years-cdc-sounds-alarm/"&gt;highest level they’ve been in more than seven decades.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Distressingly, syphilis is among the number of STIs you can contract without having intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s possible to get an STI without having penetrative sex. Herpes, syphilis and HPV can all be passed via skin-to-skin contact with an infected area of the body,” &lt;a href="https://www.evvy.com/contributor/olivia-cassano"&gt;Olivia Cassano&lt;/a&gt; of Evvy, a company that offers vaginal health services, including at-home microbiome tests, clinical care and coaching, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Skin-to-skin transmissions also include sharing bodily fluids through actions like mutual masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassano noted that in addition to skin-to-skin contact, STIs can be transmitted via oral sex. Specifically, both gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect the throat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both infections can also infect the eyes, which contain mucous membranes that STIs can easily invade. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacteria from gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect the eyes through direct contact with semen or vaginal discharge from an infected person — or a person rubs their eyes after touching infected genital areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another STI eye infection is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/24/health/cluster-of-sexually-transmitted-eye-syphilis-cases-point-to-one-man-cdc/"&gt;ocular syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, which develops when the Treponema&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pallidum bacterium enters the body, usually through sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Penetrative sex isn’t the only way to catch an STI, so it’s best to inform yourself and be prepared before any kind of sexual contact,” warned Cassano.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cassano explained that while the vast majority of STIs are transmitted via some form of sexual contact, caution should be used when sharing razors, needles and sex toys. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Roman – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She urged the orally active to use dental dams as a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassano explained that while the vast majority of STIs are transmitted via some form of sexual contact, caution should be used when using or sharing razors, needles and sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.evvy.com/blog/can-you-get-an-std-without-having-sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Evvy&lt;/a&gt;, “Infections like HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C can also be spread through sharing needles or other equipment that comes into contact with infected blood, like during intravenous drug use or through unsterilized tattoo needles.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, Cassano explained that STIs can be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She stressed the importance of consistent condom use for sexually active people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;STI cases are on the rise in the US.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Saiful52 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How to further guard against contracting or spreading an STI? “Have open communication with sexual partners and get regular STI screenings!” she urged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.universaldrugstore.com/health-news/sexual-health-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Universal Drugstore&lt;/a&gt;‘s “Sexual Health Index,” certain states are hotspots for STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi, for one, was ranked as the “worst affected” by &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/health/weird-place-you-can-get-an-sti-that-everyone-can-see-revealed/"&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt;, with one of the highest chlamydia rates in the nation of 700 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIV is most prevalent in Georgia, with 23.1 cases per 100,000 residents, a figure that is more than double the national average. On the other hand, Minnesota has the fewest HIV cases, with only 4.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug, which is the active ingredient of many pain-relief medications, is one of the few considered safe to take during pregnancy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings suggest, however, that doctors should reconsider prescribing medications with acetaminophen to mothers during pregnancy, the researchers said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the prior studies asked women to self-report whether they had taken Tylenol or anything that contained acetaminophen,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/brennan-baker/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brennan Baker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Seattle Children’s Research Institute. Baker also works in the lab of Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.peds.uw.edu/directory/sheela_sathyanarayana/1330" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sheela Sathyanarayana&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a UW Medicine pediatrician.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This medication was also approved decades ago, and may need reevaluation by the FDA,” said Sathyanarayana, the paper’s senior author.  “Acetaminophen was never evaluated for fetal exposures in relations to long-term neurodevelopmental impacts.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is widely used during pregnancy, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7192766/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;41–70% of pregnant individuals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, Europe and Asia reporting use. Despite acetaminophen’s classification as low risk by regulatory agencies such as the FDA, accumulating evidence suggests a potential link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including ADHD and ADHD autism spectrum disorder, the researchers noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research tracked a cohort of 307 women from 2006 to 2011, who agreed to give blood samples during their pregnancy.  The researchers tracked plasma biomarkers for acetaminophen in the samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children born to these mothers were followed for 8 to 10 years. Among the women who did not use acetaminophen during pregnancy, the rate of ADHD was 9%, but for the women who used acetaminophen, the ADHD rate among their offspring was 18%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen metabolites were detected in 20.2% of maternal plasma samples. Children whose mothers had these biomarkers present in their plasma had a 3.15 times higher likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis compared with those without detected exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was stronger among daughters than sons, with the daughters of acetaminophen-exposed mothers showing a 6.16 times higher likelihood of ADHD while the association was weaker and nonsignificant in males. Researchers did not know why the association was stronger in females.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investigators’ analysis used data from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) &lt;a href="https://candlestudy.uthsc.edu/what-candle/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research cohort&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which comprised 1,031 pregnant individuals in Memphis, Tenn., who were enrolled between 2006 and 2011.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By happenstance, and not by design, the study cohort included only Black women, Baker said, adding that the results could be generalized to woman and children of any race or ethnicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mothers often are advised to turn to acetaminophen, the primary agent in Tylenol, rather than ibuprofen, which is more likely to adversely affect the fetal kidney or heart, Baker said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(Acetaminophen) is really the only option to control fever or pain during pregnancy,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is a mother to do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is obviously more work that needs to be done in this area,” he said. “And we need to continually update our guidance.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he suggested, during prenatal visits, patients should discuss the dosage of a drug that contains acetaminophen or talk about what pain it is intended to help manage, he said. Another drug class, such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554507/#:~:text=Triptans%20comprise%20a%20class%20of,lasting%20at%20least%204%20hours." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;triptans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; is safe and effective for managing migraines, he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to find out if some people can tolerate acetaminophen during pregnancy with no ill effects on the fetus while others cannot, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that research findings on the effects of the drug and its potential risks during pregnancy have not been consistent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently released in Sweden, showed no link between maternal acetaminophen use and ADHD in their children; while another &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/6/1702/739709" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out of Norway, did in fact find a link. The study out of Sweden, however, relied on self-reported data, Baker noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study out of Sweden, however, reported that only 7% of pregnant individuals used acetaminophen,” Baker noted. “And that study could have underestimated the exposure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it goes back to how the data was collected,” he added. “The conflicting results means that more research is needed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical societies and the FDA should update guidance on the use of acetaminophen as safety data emerges, Sathyanarayana said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (UG3UH3OD023271). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UW Medicine Newsroom</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:09:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTDRrTnVZdHBVUk9PaUF6YmFOY0thOHBCNXJsZ1FFUldjZ1dCMTRNWmY5Q1V4X0ZlUExrT21HRXBEMHV6NzVFd21mX3RDOEdmMlRlUHJrOC1WcG5ZX2Z4aW5iRTJkWWVTa05XZ1lXX2hHUGlJWUxucUZGbUpoc2M5VkZoQmpxNnVVNlFUZmtPWkdudUZMMEdj</guid></item><item><title>This is the best time to go to bed to stay healthy as you age - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNdHVmWW9Ga0JlQ0xTSmkzM2tlb3NkajZINGkzTzdzTWd0NjhuT0Y4elNxMmtBU1VzZ3JBMi16MURScGZ1NlpRbUVBOEFranFyN2JJemtlU3NoSUNGOWRUNWhWZXV1LU9OSGZuVVBOamRyT0ZxUnhBQ3pLT0xYRlQ2NXF3VXFjUGU5Z1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep/deep-sleep"&gt;Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the ideal amount of deep sleep is 1.4-2 hours, or 20-25 per cent of our overall sleep. However, the amount a person gets can vary depending on factors including age, genetics and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most sleep cycles last between one and two hours, and if we lose even half an hour of sleep, we might lose the deep sleep part which is vital for the brain’s cleaning,” says Dr Sabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Deep sleep ‘washes out’ brain toxins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although scientists have long known about the restorative properties of sleep, it was in 2013 that a team from the University of Rochester Medical Centre in the US identified a system in the brain akin to a dishwasher’s rinse cycle, which is activated during sleep. They found a series of tiny channels surrounding the brain’s blood vessels that allow pulses of cerebrospinal fluid to wash in and be pushed through the brain tissue. As it leaves, it carries the day’s metabolic waste with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They named it the glymphatic system because of its similarity to the body’s lymphatic network, except managed by the glial cells, which support the brain’s neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain isn’t like other organ systems, such as the liver, where cells regenerate – our neuron levels aren’t replenished,” says Dr Ahmad Khundakar, a senior lecturer in biomedical science at Teesside University, whose specialism is dementia and neuroscience. “Because of that, if proteins build up, they can eventually cause neurodegeneration. The glymphatic system is very important as a clearance mechanism to flush out these proteins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, brain changes associated with dementia also &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5910033/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;disturb sleep&lt;/a&gt;, disrupting the synchronised brain waves which happen during deep sleep – a vicious cycle, which prevents the glymphatic system working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with Alzheimer’s, abnormal levels of beta-amyloid protein clump together to form plaques. Tau protein also accumulates and begins sticking together in tangles. These harm the communication between neurons, eventually causing them to die off and the brain to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another protein, alpha-synuclein, is naturally abundant in our brains but in many people with Parkinson’s, it clumps together in masses called Lewy bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often, we see a combination of different protein build-ups in the brains of people with dementia,” he says. “It’s very rare that you get pure Alzheimer’s or pure Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do we get less deep sleep as we age?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies and children have a large amount of slow wave sleep, before this begins to decline from early adulthood onwards. As we age, we begin to have relatively short periods of slow-wave sleep and fewer of them, making our sleep lighter and more fragmented. Although the reason is not yet fully understood, it is thought to be due to the lower levels of growth hormone and melatonin our bodies produce. “Our circadian rhythm is disrupted as we grow older, and that deeper sleep is harder to reach,” says Dr Sabia.&lt;/p&gt;

Interest in alternative births has also been tied to mistrust in the mainstream U.S. healthcare system due to factors like an increase in c-sections, disproportionate rates of non-white maternal deaths in hospitals, and implicit bias in medical care. As alternative practices increase in popularity, doctors are concerned about the influence of social media posts that don’t always tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s important to share information and give evidence to show that this is not all rainbows and sunshine,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/dawn-nolt-md-mph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dawn Nolt" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/dawn-nolt-md-mph" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Dawn Nolt&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and author of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/2/e2021055554/184545/Risks-of-Infectious-Diseases-in-Newborns-Exposed?autologincheck=redirected" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="pediatrics report" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/2/e2021055554/184545/Risks-of-Infectious-Diseases-in-Newborns-Exposed?autologincheck=redirected" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;pediatrics report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on alternative perinatal practices. “There are risks to some of these things.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many alternative birth practices have not been studied comprehensively.

There’s also triple the risk of neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Midwives have been around for centuries for a reason,” Rankins said. “Having someone present who understands birth and can address potential problems is lifesaving.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rankins noted that having a midwife attend to a home birth is essential. She partners with midwives in her community to provide a safe place for transfer to the hospital when needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis shared that she has personally witnessed devastating outcomes from freebirths and is concerned that social media has glamorized the trend, causing some people to forgo medical resources that they could have otherwise accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I understand and appreciate that there is mistrust in medicine … but there are ways to have an unmedicated, natural experience while still having medical support to ensure a safer and better outcome for you and the baby,” Dennis said. “If someone is considering a freebirth, I would encourage them to really ask themselves why and explore deeply what they are trying to gain … and see if there are ways that it can be accomplished by still being supported by someone who is licensed to practice medicine.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lotus Birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like freebirth, lotus birth appeals to those who seek natural experiences. A lotus birth involves leaving the baby attached to the umbilical cord and placenta until they fall off, which can take as few as &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="five days and up to 15 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;five days and up to 15 days&lt;/a&gt;. The placenta is typically covered with salt and herbs to minimize odor and is carried close to the baby in a bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACOG and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have not taken a position on lotus birth, and the practice has not been fully studied. However, the AAP released Nolt’s report in its journal, Pediatrics&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;to help physicians understand the practice and treat patients who may have been involved in a lotus birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In our research, the impetus for lotus birth … is the idea that there is a spiritual connection of the placenta to the baby and that there needs to be a nonviolent separation of those two entities,” Nolt said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This spiritual connection is hard to prove or disprove, and Nolt said that medical professionals are expected to follow proven practices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We as physicians try to think more about what science there is and risk/benefit to the baby,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report found no evidence-based benefit to babies with lotus birth. Risks include infection from the dead tissue, tearing of the umbilical cord and jaundice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proponents of lotus birth have noted the advantages of extra blood flowing from the placenta to the baby, but the same outcome can be achieved by delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, a standard practice when there is no distress. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis For Morning Sickness &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis has been used to ease nausea for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thousands of years" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;thousands of years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so&lt;span&gt; it’s not entirely surprising that people have tried it to treat morning sickness — but physicians warn against it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite this, a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="analysis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; examined 90,000 umbilical cords sampled from 2019-2023 and found that 20% tested positive for cannabis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum and was so miserable that I probably would have tried almost anything to feel better, but I’ll tell you, that would not have included marijuana,” Dennis said. “That’s because there is no demonstrated safe level of marijuana in pregnancy.” Hyperemesis gravidarum is a rare form of morning sickness that causes persistent vomiting that can lead to dehydration and other medical issues. It is typically treated with anti-nausea prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dennis pointed out that it would be unethical to clinically test cannabis use during pregnancy, but collected case reports have demonstrated the outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found historically, and continue to find now, that there are higher numbers of people who have early pregnancy exposure to marijuana, that there is no safe level,” Dennis said. “It does increase the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including smaller birth weight. Depending on how much someone is using and how long they are using throughout pregnancy, there can be withdrawal in newborns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use during pregnancy has also been tied to abnormal brain development and other &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/pregnancy.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="complications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/pregnancy.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt;, but more research is needed.

Interest in alternative births has also been tied to mistrust in the mainstream U.S. healthcare system due to factors like an increase in c-sections, disproportionate rates of non-white maternal deaths in hospitals, and implicit bias in medical care.

There’s also triple the risk of neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Midwives have been around for centuries for a reason,” Rankins said. “Having someone present who understands birth and can address potential problems is lifesaving.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rankins noted that having a midwife attend to a home birth is essential. She partners with midwives in her community to provide a safe place for transfer to the hospital when needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis shared that she has personally witnessed devastating outcomes from freebirths and is concerned that social media has glamorized the trend, causing some people to forgo medical resources that they could have otherwise accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I understand and appreciate that there is mistrust in medicine … but there are ways to have an unmedicated, natural experience while still having medical support to ensure a safer and better outcome for you and the baby,” Dennis said. “If someone is considering a freebirth, I would encourage them to really ask themselves why and explore deeply what they are trying to gain … and see if there are ways that it can be accomplished by still being supported by someone who is licensed to practice medicine.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lotus Birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like freebirth, lotus birth appeals to those who seek natural experiences. A lotus birth involves leaving the baby attached to the umbilical cord and placenta until they fall off, which can take as few as &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="five days and up to 15 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;five days and up to 15 days&lt;/a&gt;. The placenta is typically covered with salt and herbs to minimize odor and is carried close to the baby in a bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACOG and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have not taken a position on lotus birth, and the practice has not been fully studied. However, the AAP released Nolt’s report in its journal, Pediatrics&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;to help physicians understand the practice and treat patients who may have been involved in a lotus birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In our research, the impetus for lotus birth … is the idea that there is a spiritual connection of the placenta to the baby and that there needs to be a nonviolent separation of those two entities,” Nolt said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This spiritual connection is hard to prove or disprove, and Nolt said that medical professionals are expected to follow proven practices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We as physicians try to think more about what science there is and risk/benefit to the baby,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report found no evidence-based benefit to babies with lotus birth. Risks include infection from the dead tissue, tearing of the umbilical cord and jaundice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proponents of lotus birth have noted the advantages of extra blood flowing from the placenta to the baby, but the same outcome can be achieved by delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, a standard practice when there is no distress. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis For Morning Sickness &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis has been used to ease nausea for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thousands of years" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;thousands of years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so&lt;span&gt; it’s not entirely surprising that people have tried it to treat morning sickness — but physicians warn against it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite this, a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="analysis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; examined 90,000 umbilical cords sampled from 2019-2023 and found that 20% tested positive for cannabis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum and was so miserable that I probably would have tried almost anything to feel better, but I’ll tell you, that would not have included marijuana,” Dennis said. “That’s because there is no demonstrated safe level of marijuana in pregnancy.” Hyperemesis gravidarum is a rare form of morning sickness that causes persistent vomiting that can lead to dehydration and other medical issues. It is typically treated with anti-nausea prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dennis pointed out that it would be unethical to clinically test cannabis use during pregnancy, but collected case reports have demonstrated the outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found historically, and continue to find now, that there are higher numbers of people who have early pregnancy exposure to marijuana, that there is no safe level,” Dennis said. “It does increase the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including smaller birth weight.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;American doctors, who tracked over 37 million people, said the injections put users at higher risk of nonarteritic ischemic anterior optic neuropathy (NAION) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The condition, known as an 'eye stroke', occurs when the vessels supplying blood to the optic nerve become blocked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, they &lt;span&gt;said while the exact cause was unclear, the rapid drop in blood sugar caused by the drug could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;damage blood vessels in the eyes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is because the sudden change in pressure can cause fluid to leak out of delicate blood vessels in the retina, leading to swelling and damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around half a million people in the UK and some 15million in the US are now thought to be using the jabs, which can help them lose up to 20 per cent of their bodyweight in just a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the researchers from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, found of the 37 million adults, there were 166,932 patients on type 2 diabetes drugs, including semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2024.6555?guestAccessKey=9cc7cefb-e963-490d-bbd1-8ad419a0b542&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=022025"&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said: 'We observed an increased NAION risk with semaglutide exposure relative to non-exposure.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They also observed an 'increased risk' among those on semaglutide compared to 'users of non–GLP-1 drugs empagliflozin and sitagliptin,' they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They added: 'In the absence of a known mechanism for this association, we urge clinicians to weigh the concern for an increased risk of a rare but potentially blinding eye condition with the many therapeutic benefits of semaglutide.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are currently no treatments for NAION or an 'eye stroke', which affects around one in 10,000 people, and vision often does not improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other strokes caused by a loss of blood supply, there is no weakness, numbness or loss of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People typically suffer sudden vision loss in one eye, without any pain, and patients often notice the issue on waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as a separate study &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2829326"&gt;published in the same medical journal&lt;/a&gt; last month suggested that the drugs may trigger debilitating vision issues including NAION. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14380795/ozempic-patients-blind-doctors-effect.html"&gt;noted this was likely due&lt;/a&gt; to the fact the jabs rapidly lower blood sugar levels which could damage blood vessels in the eyes — not that the injections themselves were 'toxic'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report detailed the cases of nine adults, aged 57 on average, who took either  semaglutide or tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven were later diagnosed with NAION. But most noticed their vision improving within days or weeks of stopping the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the report, one &lt;span&gt;woman in her 50s developed NAION the day after her first semaglutide injection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She woke up the morning after the injection with 'painful vision loss' in her left eye. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed swelling in her optic nerve and damaged blood vessels in her retina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman stopped taking semaglutide and her insulin, with follow-up appointments confirming her vision returned to normal two months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, t&lt;span&gt;wo weeks after restarting semaglutide to control her diabetes, the vision loss returned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was diagnosed with severe optic nerve swelling, and her vision returned to normal seven months later. &lt;/span&gt;It was unclear if she stopped semaglutide a second time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials in Denmark, where Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk is based, are also currently &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14205789/officials-ozempic-cause-blinding-eye-disease-Denmark-EU.html"&gt;investigating the links between semaglutide and vision loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like any medication, the jabs are known to cause side effects that vary in both frequency and severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other reported problems include constipation, fatigue, stomach pain, headaches and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bizarre symptoms, such as hair loss, have also been reported among some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have also long told how they are treating increasing numbers of slim women who end up in hospital after falsely telling online chemists they are overweight to pass eligibility checks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35 and at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, or those who have a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, law forbids the sale of such drugs without a prescription from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December, advertising officials issued a warning to advertisers, businesses and influencers to remove online and social media ads for weight-loss prescription-only medicines targeted at members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This followed a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14083761/social-media-influencers-thousands-prescription-Mounjaro-jabs.html"&gt;MailOnline investigation&lt;/a&gt; that found social media influencers were being encouraged to illegally promote prescription weight-loss jabs to their thousands of&lt;span&gt; followers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:11:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Study: Bird Flu May Spread Through the Air - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMzJ0cGRVSWN3bC1DYXhMLUZYVmRhY3pXN0ZaaXNzVXlJbUJER2NiblQ3XzEwZTNYZ1l2UzZNY1d1YzZXQXpfdDk1ZjhHSlVpMlVQZHpNMVlIQ1FqZEFZZ1liekluTy13YndJeXh6eUk2YXktNzBsSlNZSU1aLXpqNDdrLS1CYXVGMGVqUElWb9IBlAFBVV95cUxPaFNFMGE4ZzZrZEVNMnJfVmIwaTNzRG93bFBpRmdLdE4xYzlNWXo1cEJZcUtRbXdfUHpkQkt2bUkzVzdMRFhHUWxmNlluX2NWWHFuS0Qzc2oyWExCUnpHUmllZmxBVTlqMkVYRWVweEtIWHg2U2xxVmp0czN1dm45MEJoaDhaMFJ6MTdZcnJOM1NBZEY5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The highly contagious H5N1 bird flu virus may be spreading through the air under certain conditions, according to a new study from the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government veterinarians made the discovery while investigating a mysterious outbreak at a highly secured chicken farm last February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The farm had strict biosecurity measures — filtered well water, one-way airflow fans and fencing to keep wild animals out. Yet, the virus still infected the flock, causing thousands of bird deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely culprit? Wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamil Sedlak, senior study author and director of the State Veterinary Institute in Prague, said that after all the possibilities were explored, windborne spread was most likely cause in this case, CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts traced the virus back to a duck farm nearly 5 miles west of the chicken facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duck farm, near a lake that hosted wildlife, had far less biosecurity and had been hit by a massive outbreak days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird flu swept through the duck farm rapidly —  800 ducks died on the first day. Within two days, 5,000 had died. A few days later, the entire 50,000-bird flock was culled to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the chickens at the breeding facility became sick slowly. Birds near air intake vents were the first to die, suggesting they were exposed to virus particles carried by the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers checked the weather data from that week, which revealed perfect conditions for windborne spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a steady breeze from west to east (from the duck farm to the chicken farm). There was also a lot of cloud cover, which blocked UV light that usually kills viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, there were cooler temperatures —between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, which is ideal for virus survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that under certain specific conditions, the spread of the avian influenza virus by wind can occur,” Sedlak told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were published on the preprint server bioRxiv, should be considered preliminary until they are peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Influenza Ecology, said windborne spread has been suspected before but is hard to prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The whole idea of potentially being sort of wind-driven has been out there for a while,” Webby, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He noted that the current strains of bird flu circulating in animals don’t easily infect people and would likely need to mutate more to become a serious human threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very low-risk for humans to be infected with the virus like that, but I think it happens,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Osterholm also warned that wind-driven spread might explain unusual cases, such as the three veterinarians who tested positive for H5N1 antibodies after attending a conference, despite having no direct contact with sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not only how much virus is blowing out into the air but also where it lands, said Dr. Montserrat Torremorell, professor and chair of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, who reviewed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torremorell recommended farms consider filtering the air in barns, in addition to following current precautions such as personal protective equipment and restricted access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the airborne transmission should be on the table,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;


                    

                    
                &lt;/div&gt;

Women between the ages of 40 and 54 who were not yet menopausal were at the highest risk and were 45 percent more likely to develop long covid than men of the same age&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UHKVSPGVARCHPJ7MVE3VQLMAAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, among women ages 40 to 54 who had already experienced menopause and women ages 18 to 39, there was no significant difference in long-covid risk compared to men in the same age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VZUMI3BRTJC7TCGGWXC6EJKDPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This suggests that hormones involved in menopause, fertility and pregnancy may play a role, and may be protective factors against long covid, said &lt;a href="https://directory.uthscsa.edu/academics/profile/shahdp"&gt;Dimpy Shah&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of population health sciences with the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="7BRMH4RVIVF6HJZAM6TY3SXHRU" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="7BRMH4RVIVF6HJZAM6TY3SXHRU"&gt;Higher estrogen levels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KSE77P2RAFGX7DW6MAXG2HDCOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During menopause, estrogen levels in women &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2717878/"&gt;tend to drop&lt;/a&gt;. Shah said. And while adult women under the age of 40 have high levels of estrogen, they also tend to have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1583036/#:~:text=A%20consistent%20pattern%20of%20age,39%2Dyear%2Dold%20groups."&gt;higher levels&lt;/a&gt; of progesterone, a hormone that helps to balance and regulate estrogen in the body, she said. This is especially true if they are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558960/"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KPC7OEJV4VAW3ARXJZVD2NERAA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both estrogen and testosterone interact with the immune system in ways that are not yet fully understood. But generally, experts said, higher levels of estrogen may be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4226184/#:~:text=Estrogens%20influence%20immune%20and%20inflammatory,pregnancy%2C%20and%20menopause%20%5B9%2C"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-020-01998-9"&gt;chronic&lt;/a&gt;, longer-term &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02279/full"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt;, which may help explain why women are &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722"&gt;almost twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; as men to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ENWQGGVQMVC7FAKU7U7XF5CM6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shah cautioned that further study is needed on the role of hormone levels in the development of long covid, though hormones may not completely explain the long covid risk among some women. It probably is a combined effect of age, pregnancy and menopause, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORKIQUYGFVHW7NTLJWTT2G3AHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study found that women ages 55 and older — who would be menopausal — had a 34 percent higher risk of developing long covid than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OX2VC3UIYNHOLIBLHRUSCWRRII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shah also said that other factors, such as preexisting differences between men and women in their rate of having autoimmune diseases and other comorbidities, could be playing a role, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2N2PEXVHFHXRG4YP674UNZBB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/akiko-iwasaki/"&gt;Akiko Iwasaki&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, said the findings suggest that hormones play a key role in long covid, and hormone-replacement treatments may be beneficial for long-covid patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63CUQUIWJNF6TERO565GTRVSEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anecdotally, she said some of her long-covid patients have seen their symptoms improve while taking low-dose testosterone treatments. In women, testosterone helps to regulate the immune system and prevent it from being overactive, she explained, so testosterone therapy could be helping to reduce their inflammation and autoimmune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="NL7PEYAO45FZRN7OB75YQYGBNI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="NL7PEYAO45FZRN7OB75YQYGBNI"&gt;Different symptoms among men and women&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TAMFGJE57VENXBHM5NNIRFGY7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The RECOVER study also noted that men and women with long covid experienced different types of symptoms, which, Iwasaki said, mirrored the results of &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.24303568v1.full"&gt;her own research&lt;/a&gt; and suggests that in some cases, long covid in men and women may actually be different yet related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSYNTE47B5CWRFUUWBZ6Q76FAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“When I first saw the study, I thought, ‘Wow, a lot of the differences they’re seeing are exactly what we see in our work,’” she said. “This is revealing more subsets of long covid that may be triggered by different causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5PMRO5J6X5ARPNSF4UPHMFG7GA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her research suggests that men with long covid are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction, whereas women are more likely to experience hair loss, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry eyes, and a loss of smell and taste.

Her &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.18.599612v1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that while women who developed long covid tended to have a normal-looking immune system response to kill the coronavirus, they then experienced increased inflammation, even after the virus is gone — compared with women who recovered, who were able to resolve this inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QCKM44AQ7ZHMHEY64TO5ALHSXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Women with long covid also had increased levels of a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/02/01/why-women-have-more-autoimmune-diseases/"&gt;gene that is associated with autoimmune disease, called Xist&lt;/a&gt;, compared with women who did not develop long covid, Blish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5KQ6G3JZQ5BCLMJ67K4DMQ6L24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In contrast, Blish said, men with long covid appear to have a harder time killing off the coronavirus in the first place, which suggests that their symptoms may be a result of a more persistent infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ENIDNKUKQ5EHBPKPUPWG3JH3KI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both of these immune system responses need to be studied further, she said, but these results suggest that the prevention and treatment of long covid in men and women could vary significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WOD4LQ5UARFZHO3O3RMZFGERKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even if they end up in the same place, the underlying drivers of disease can be quite different,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FRMPTGEU2RH3JBDPXMZ2V7RRIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One limitation of the RECOVER study is that it did not include data about participants’ hormone levels, menstrual cycles, pregnancies or use of hormone-related medications such as birth control. However, Shah said, the study did collect biological specimens from participants that she hopes to use in research to analyze their hormone levels throughout their coronavirus infection and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUGZBSRJZJGVXITYPUB6FHRQWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the meantime, she hopes that the results of her recent study could help validate women’s experiences with the disease. She said that this study offers proof that women’s concerns about long covid are valid and that it could help encourage women — especially those ages 40 to 54 — experiencing lasting symptoms after a coronavirus infection to seek help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VNTV6LRBQBBGFMQ2MX7PQQQ3NU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you feel something is wrong, don’t just ignore it,” Shah said. “Go see a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:58:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQeG9uYkp2MHBhQmJ4V3hsdE1fblAwNDM3dXphSF9uVmRtdko2cmJJTEZqcmhXai1VYWREajRuYTIxUmtoZUVhWTlWWlZhU0d6azJ3NzRJMmVNcmZPWktRS2dtaF9mQ0pGVlJtWWFmMlNxSWJrZzJDRkdMN2VycEpFU3JkV05lV2hQczRrM1FfUkxjMDQ</guid></item><item><title>Experts warn weight-loss diet followed by millions can trigger deadly kidney condition - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A diet loved by influencers and celebrities, including podcasting giant Joe Rogan, could trigger a serious kidney disease, US medics have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media is awash with accounts hyping the carnivore diet, which sees proponents mainly or only consume animal-based foods like steak, eggs and butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advocates claim to have seen a &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14283535/havent-eaten-carbs-fruit-vegetables-SIX-YEARS-effect-body.html"&gt;huge a range of health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, including weight-loss and easing of gut symptoms, by making the switch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors from the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-955f2b30-efa1-11ef-b21b-53e6bc0bcea1"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; University School of Medicine have now warned the diet could lead to increased risk of agonising kidney stones — stone-like lumps in the organ that form from excess waste products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, large stones block the flow of urine out of the body, leading to potentially life-threatening infections and risking &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-955d5670-efa1-11ef-b21b-53e6bc0bcea1"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics' warning was sparked by a recent case of a patient who adopted the diet after learning about it on &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/youtube/index.html" id="mol-955e67e0-efa1-11ef-b21b-53e6bc0bcea1"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and suffered major complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524014199"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, they stated that the 68 year-old man lost two-stone while only eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, tests performed a year after he began his diet revealed that his body was in the earliest stages of forming the painful crystals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS says meat is a good source of protein which the body needs to maintain and build muscle, and can also provide a good source of vitamins and minerals like iron, zinc and B vitamins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Social media is awash with accounts hyping the carnivore diet, which sees proponents mainly or only consume animal-based foods like steak, eggs and butter.

He was also given medication to help with gout, a type of arthritis and the condition he was attempting to treat with the extreme eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the medics reported their patient remained kidney stone free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case they said it highlighted the potential risks a carnivore diet posed for kidney stone formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This patient’s urine studies demonstrate the potential hazards of the carnivore diet,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to increased animal protein, the exclusion of dairy products, and the removal of fruits and vegetables, the diet creates an optimal environment for the development of all stone types.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The advent of social media and the use of such communication for health information will make fad diets a continually growing issue.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics said a wealth of evidence showed eating too much meat contributed to kidney stones by increasing levels of uric acid in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 'acidic environment' helps the waste products to crystallise, they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, large stones block the flow of urine out of the body, leading to potentially life-threatening infections and risking &lt;a target="_self"

He was also given medication to help with gout, a type of arthritis and the condition he was attempting to treat with the extreme eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the medics reported their patient remained kidney stone free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case they said it highlighted the potential risks a carnivore diet posed for kidney stone formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This patient’s urine studies demonstrate the potential hazards of the carnivore diet,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to increased animal protein, the exclusion of dairy products, and the removal of fruits and vegetables, the diet creates an optimal environment for the development of all stone types.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The advent of social media and the use of such communication for health information will make fad diets a continually growing issue.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics said a wealth of evidence showed eating too much meat contributed to kidney stones by increasing levels of uric acid in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 'acidic environment' helps the waste products to crystallise, they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Women between the ages of 40 and 54 who were not yet menopausal were at the highest risk and were 45 percent more likely to develop long covid than men of the same age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, among women ages 40 to 54 who had already experienced menopause and women ages 18 to 39, there was no significant difference in long-covid risk compared to men in the same age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This suggests that hormones involved in menopause, fertility and pregnancy may play a role, and may be protective factors against long covid, said Dimpy Shah, an assistant professor of population health sciences with the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher estrogen levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During menopause, estrogen levels in women tend to drop. Shah said. And while adult women under the age of 40 have high levels of estrogen, they also tend to have higher levels of progesterone, a hormone that helps to balance and regulate estrogen in the body, she said. This is especially true if they are pregnant, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both estrogen and testosterone interact with the immune system in ways that are not yet fully understood. But generally, experts said, higher levels of estrogen may be associated with chronic, longer-term immune responses, which may help explain why women are almost twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shah cautioned that further study is needed on the role of hormone levels in the development of long covid, though hormones may not completely explain the long covid risk among some women. It probably is a combined effect of age, pregnancy and menopause, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study found that women ages 55 and older - who would be menopausal - had a 34 percent higher risk of developing long covid than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shah also said that other factors, such as preexisting differences between men and women in their rate of having autoimmune diseases and other comorbidities, could be playing a role, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, said the findings suggest that hormones play a key role in long covid, and hormone-replacement treatments may be beneficial for long-covid patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Anecdotally, she said some of her long-covid patients have seen their symptoms improve while taking low-dose testosterone treatments. In women, testosterone helps to regulate the immune system and prevent it from being overactive, she explained, so testosterone therapy could be helping to reduce their inflammation and autoimmune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Different symptoms among men and women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The RECOVER study also noted that men and women with long covid experienced different types of symptoms, which, Iwasaki said, mirrored the results of her own research and suggests that in some cases, long covid in men and women may actually be different yet related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I first saw the study, I thought, ‘Wow, a lot of the differences they’re seeing are exactly what we see in our work,’” she said. “This is revealing more subsets of long covid that may be triggered by different causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her research suggests that men with long covid are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction, whereas women are more likely to experience hair loss, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry eyes, and a loss of smell and taste. Women with long covid had a greater number of more severe symptoms then men, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Comparing long covid in men vs. women is a useful way to understand the disease because there can be such “dramatic differences” in the immune system responses between the two, said Catherine Blish, an immunologist and a professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women’s experience of an autoimmune response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women with long covid seem to experience more of an autoimmune response, Blish explained. Her research indicates that while women who developed long covid tended to have a normal-looking immune system response to kill the coronavirus, they then experienced increased inflammation, even after the virus is gone - compared with women who recovered, who were able to resolve this inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women with long covid also had increased levels of a gene that is associated with autoimmune disease, called Xist, compared with women who did not develop long covid, Blish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In contrast, Blish said, men with long covid appear to have a harder time killing off the coronavirus in the first place, which suggests that their symptoms may be a result of a more persistent infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both of these immune system responses need to be studied further, she said, but these results suggest that the prevention and treatment of long covid in men and women could vary significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even if they end up in the same place, the underlying drivers of disease can be quite different,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One limitation of the RECOVER study is that it did not include data about participants’ hormone levels, menstrual cycles, pregnancies or use of hormone-related medications such as birth control. However, Shah said, the study did collect biological specimens from participants that she hopes to use in research to analyze their hormone levels throughout their coronavirus infection and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, she hopes that the results of her recent study could help validate women’s experiences with the disease. She said that this study offers proof that women’s concerns about long covid are valid and that it could help encourage women - especially those ages 40 to 54 - experiencing lasting symptoms after a coronavirus infection to seek help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you feel something is wrong, don’t just ignore it,” Shah said. “Go see a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/02/20/los-angeles-homes-after-fires/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Their homes survived the L.A. fires.

But the U.S. hasn't contributed its information on what's spreading there since January, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For seasonal influenza, which forced schools to shut down in some American states earlier this month, the data isn't being shared, Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the WHO's global influenza program, told journalists in a webinar on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) normally participate in global discussions hosted by WHO on influenza vaccinations twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed seasonal flu information is important to monitor outbreaks globally and to inform which influenza strains should be included in vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere's following winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since 20th January, CDC has not yet reported into the WHO platform of Flunet and FluID," Zhang said, referring to two databases for influenza surveillance. As of last week, the U.S. was publicly releasing some flu information nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, he called for his country to leave WHO, starting in January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;Former World Health Organization assistant director-general for health security Keiji Fukuda has also worked at the U.S. CDC and attended WHO's influenza vaccine meetings.  (Alain Grosclaude/AFP/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A WHO meeting is scheduled for next week in London to discuss the composition of influenza vaccines. So far, WHO says the U.S. has not indicated whether it will attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, participants look at the data to come to a consensus on if the strains in the previous seasonal vaccine are still thought to work or if they need to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanta Subbarao says the U.S. also contributes expertise on vaccine effectiveness and key material used by vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subbarao, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist and influenza scientist now working at Laval University in Quebec City, served as director of WHO's Collaborating Centre for Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. It is one of five such centres for human influenza along with the U.S. CDC in Atlanta, England, China and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH | ERs under pressure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mediaEmbed"&gt;&lt;div class="player-placeholder-ui-container " data-cy="player-placeholder-ui-container"&gt;&lt;div class="player-placeholder-video-ui" title="Flu cases usually wind down this time of year.

Quebec alone saw 4,600 cases last week, with some ending up in the ICU.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is a very bad time for the flu vaccine," Subbarao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CDC and FDA are very actively involved normally in this process, so it's a little hard for me to fathom what it will look like without them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subbarao said the U.S. collaborating centre often receives influenza viruses from Canada and other parts of the Americas as well as Africa and parts of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC, the FDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment from CBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;U.S. makes a 'big difference'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a physician and epidemiologist who has attended influenza vaccine meetings and worked for both WHO and CDC, said it's crucial for U.S. experts to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;U.S. participation is important to be able to accurately predict which influenza strains are going to be circulating in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, virologists say. (Lou Benoist/AFP/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interpretation of that data is so important," Fukuda said in an interview. "Hearing your peers discuss how they're looking at it may change how you look at it and these kinds of interactions are how we come up with the best formulations for vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. participation is crucial to be able to accurately predict which influenza strains are going to be circulating in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the United States is so geographically large, because it is so populous, it really does make a big difference to know which of those influenza strains … are the ones that are going to be predominant and essentially win the race against the other influenza viruses," said Rasmussen. She studies a range of viral pathogens, including flu, and isn't participating in WHO's influenza vaccine meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO's influenza surveillance program includes about 130 member states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC released weekly seasonal flu information on Feb. 14, as well as an update on cases of H5N1 avian influenza that has infected nearly 70 people in the U.S., including a death. Most of those infections have been among farm workers exposed to infected poultry or cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists are watching closely to see if H5N1 or another type of influenza virus gains the ability to spread easily from person to person. That's caused previous global flu pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Canadian government announced the purchase of 500,000 doses of an &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/h5n1-vaccine-canada-1.7462802" target="_blank"&gt;H5N1 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to help protect those most at risk, such as farm workers and people who handle live avian influenza virus in labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO said its influenza vaccine meeting will continue whether U.S. delegates show up or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:34:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTFA5V09mazhqcXdGV0NaZEM1TFRZellSU2pLUXNNUW5Ed0lnXzZmeUNlUUNJU0JQUDJIcHRzcDB6TU4yel9EX1N0S0ZnZVM1MXJYZm5KT2ZOZXQtTUVxeUhIVk8xSHfSAUdBVV95cUxPYndPRjR3dUhCd3ZTQ21jekY5OHdSYS14OFMwTmRsZHlyTGNqNGtUQTVTajB3T1lBcGtMd3U2RjhybDYyU29aMA</guid></item><item><title>Doctor warns 'early' sign of dementia appears when watching TV - what to look out for - Daily Express US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS0hlR2dwc2VnQnVJQlI4cGFqVlltRlNGS3VmWmdERW1Wb0lTTndObWxxNnZjZzVINWhTb3JQWUVuVm0tWl9rSDdLZ3pJcnB2V3F3bzIxMTQzUjJxQ1hYRlE3WjZpRGd3R3RVNEphejdsYXJBMVhjNUo1X1lqNm5pMGYtbkUyLWtMaDk1U1dkMVJIMFNDQ25hUEI1c2V5Y3NU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dementia expert &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/164100/doctor-warns-early-sign-dementia-appears-watching-tv" target="_blank"&gt;has raised the alarm, cautioning that an "early" indicator of the condition&lt;/a&gt; could surface during a familiar activity such as watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Rittman, a neurology consultant, highlighted some of the early &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Bruce Willis unrecognizable after health update during LA fires visit" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/160753/bruce-willis-unrecognizable-steps-out-los-angeles-fires-pictures" target="_blank"&gt;signs that a loved one could be affected&lt;/a&gt; by the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Warning over injury which 'may double' risk of developing dementia" href="/lifestyle/life/163944/warning-injury-double-risk-developing-dementia" target="_blank"&gt;Dementia encompasses a spectrum of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that accompany t&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Night-time dementia warning sign in your sleep 'decades' before symptoms appear" href="/news/health/163548/night-dementia-warning-sign-sleep-decades-before-symptoms" target="_blank"&gt;he gradual worsening of brain function&lt;/a&gt;; in the US alone, nearly &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Dementia experts highlight unusual kitchen habit as early warning sign" href="/news/health/163166/dementia-signs-alzheimers-warning-fridge-kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;a million individuals are grappling with its challenges&lt;/a&gt;, and that number is predicted to swell with the demographic shift toward an older population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the hallmarks of dementia like memory loss are widely recognized, some manifestations may not be as apparent. In an article for Alzheimer's Research UK, Dr. Rittman conveyed the complexity of diagnosing dementia in its nascent phases and how it can easily be mistaken for other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged the common uncertainty faced when changes are noticed in someone you know, "And that means it can be hard to know how much to worry if you think someone might be a bit different than when you last saw them. That's understandable – it's something many of us know very little about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a YouGov survey revealed a gap in public awareness, with less than half of those surveyed (49%) capable of identifying "memory loss" as a consequence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mere 12% of the 2,162 respondents were aware that the disease leads to a loss of independence, while a significant portion (22%) confessed to having no clue about the repercussions of living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a surprising finding, given how dementia will impact so many of us", Dr Rittman expressed. "It is important, then, to raise awareness of early signs of dementia so people with symptoms can be referred to a memory clinic for a full assessment and an accurate, timely diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An early diagnosis means that people with dementia and their loved ones can plan for the future, access the right care and support, and consider the option of taking part in research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rittman then highlighted some of the key symptoms to be aware of. He stated, "When it first starts, dementia's signs and symptoms are often mild and not that easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mild forgetfulness, changes to perception or the way we speak can be early indications that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Miss:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/163145/donald-trumps-words-super-bowl"&gt;Donald Trump's telling words at the Super Bowl exposed by lip reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/163166/dementia-signs-alzheimers-warning-fridge-kitchen"&gt;Dementia experts highlight unusual kitchen habit as early warning sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/161023/five-early-signs-dementia-including-one-shows-bed-night" target="_blank"&gt;Five early signs of dementia - including one that shows in bed at night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really important to know that these kinds of symptoms can have other causes, such as low mood, or the side-effects of medications.

You may notice someone asking the same question in quick succession or struggling to remember the names of objects around the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People may find they struggle to concentrate on daily tasks, or they may find following the storyline of a TV program difficult for example."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:13:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS0hlR2dwc2VnQnVJQlI4cGFqVlltRlNGS3VmWmdERW1Wb0lTTndObWxxNnZjZzVINWhTb3JQWUVuVm0tWl9rSDdLZ3pJcnB2V3F3bzIxMTQzUjJxQ1hYRlE3WjZpRGd3R3RVNEphejdsYXJBMVhjNUo1X1lqNm5pMGYtbkUyLWtMaDk1U1dkMVJIMFNDQ25hUEI1c2V5Y3NU</guid></item><item><title>From green tea to turmeric: Scientists warn against 5 foods that may be damaging the liver - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8wFBVV95cUxObXVBeW9uVUdNRTNQWmptbmhVcGpiMmw0Y1ZZNTJhd052YllqYWVCWGNzaU9RQnJHZHhrY0tqZ1NNa3BYUlk0SG1sWTFJZmV6SXFRZExfdlhYUGwwdVZJdGJvZDJPYWJxTHVwdTVFUFlhSlpnZ1NOOXFTUEs1X0NlNndDc2VOdVZPcF9NNVBTWlpDOTBVRFRBWnBzcjZkdmdPdlB4cjRsMWlNSGxDdTNjNVhCbnBycGI3UEhFQnVzeDlWUXdTMjdobmt1aTFFWFV5T0dVMDE2NVpxam5vVnd1TnFRaklidHdIalgxREl5cTVCYmPSAfgBQVVfeXFMTTBZblVaVGhxVENMZE82LTlRU0lYZ1NkNGxvRXc4dHlLeGJJU2VPcFJfdXFmZkl0QXdqWC14RVFycXBoaERiWWNGMUJwenN0V1pmMnlNcl9qbG5HTlNmNzlNWTNSM2t3Mkk4d1lFcm5fdGs5RXN5YUtyV01YdDh5aXB5aWlCaDZCaHdzNGNPMmctaTF6M3lGdDF2WWh5MmJWNXkzUlVyazJrcDAxQ2tiMmRFMEpwaloyRjFkNU5nOFZHTGFaR0ttbVBmNFFXSFpXWDhEOG01N3F3akt3bWVpTXhBLUpRQUFoSHQ2My0wTGlKeEJWcHZIai0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, where health often takes a backseat, mostly due to an unhealthy diet, we tend to compensate for it by popping dietary supplements. From multivitamins to calcium and fish oil, you can easily find OTC supplements in nearby stores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;58% of U.S. adults take dietary supplements, including 64% of women and 51% of men, according to the 2017–18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A 2024 poll suggests that 75% of adults take supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; points out that drug-induced acute live failure tied to herbal and dietary supplements had increased eightfold from 1995 through 2020. The herbal and dietary supplements contribute to roughly 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide, according to 2017 research published in the journal Hepatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean you should toss away your multivitamin stash and other dietary supplements? However, it is important to know what you are incorporating into your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan noted last year that 15.6 million Americans consume products containing at least one of these six botanicals linked to liver damage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garcinia cambogia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red yeast rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black cohosh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a previous study, we found that there was a great deal of mislabeling of some of these products. We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50% mismatch between the stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming. If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it’s basically a coin flip if that’s true or not,” senior author Dr. Robert Fontana, a Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We weren't aware that so many people were taking these supplements. So, when doctors see patients in the office, they don't necessarily ask about supplement use or take into consideration their effects," Likhitsup, who's also a transplant hepatologist adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies also suggested that toxic heavy metal contamination was found in some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-supplements-to-avoid-if-you-want-to-live-longer/articleshow/117403418.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplements.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the FDA regulates supplements, the federal agency does not review them for safety, quality, and effectiveness. The FDA regulates them as food, not drugs. So, it is up to the manufacturers to properly label their products, and then the FDA reviews after they hit the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to stop your nails from breaking often&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to stay safe is to communicate with your healthcare providers about the supplements you are taking. Also, don’t fall for ‘megadosing’ trends for speedy results. The Office of Dietary Supplements, part of the National Institutes of Health, has established daily upper limits (ULs) for safe consumption. For instance, adults shouldn’t consume more than 100 micrograms of vitamin D in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>HHS cancels the CDC’s ‘Wild to Mild’ flu vaccine campaign: Report - Washington Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxOd0FmdEVpaThvdkoybWI0c2YyblRrLV9tZHMxejhMZlM5dVpheTlsWG5ySXhCeG5KVVZEc083bXAwY0sxNlJOVGEwQTJwcTdxdlVfNEtYNWt0VF9xYkwzMnJmaF9SQlNtVFNDc0tNSTNEYklkVFBoOWxKMlFYQktKRnRfTHNQQjdQUlM4eFRseW9oeVdHRmNNTU9iUGc1RVZ2eHdZMDZzeWtxNVJTSUtFQXB4NF85dFZJeUVmcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cf-column"&gt;

But it’s not all a figment of the imagination either — narcissists are also more likely to be excluded from groups due to their strong personality types. Over time, this exclusion can exacerbate narcissistic traits further, creating a “self-perpetuating cycle,”  researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YULDLDPXHZCZFMME62JJ25SIQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study sheds new light on how personality traits can impact everyday life, according to lead author &lt;a href="https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/personen/christiane-buettner/" target="_blank"&gt;Christiane Büttner, of the University of Basel in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. “Many people think of narcissism in terms of entitlement and arrogance, but our research highlights that narcissists also frequently experience social pain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5CQQJZOVREYZA4LCJLP5KVF5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner worked with a global team of researchers, which used large-scale surveys, sampling and controlled experiments on people based in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Germany, the United States, Britain, Switzerland and New Zealand. While the negative impacts of social exclusion are well documented, Büttner wanted to understand who was being excluded most often and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YZCIQZ3SZNGSDHMYIGO6FHBZYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts regard narcissism as a continuous trait; however, the research team focused on those with higher narcissism scores and “grandiose narcissists” in particular. Büttner said she regards this as an “intriguing personality trait,” as it involves a desire to dominate social situations and a heightened sensitivity to social cues. It’s in contrast to vulnerable narcissism, which is more closely linked to insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLMXAYF5EBCGVFPAH24EQ6KEI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the biggest questions going into this research was whether narcissists might actually report less&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;ostracism because their grandiose self-image could shield them from perceiving negative treatment, or whether they would report more ostracism due to heightened sensitivity to social cues,” Büttner told The Washington Post in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O62JWWM7AVAWPICGAX2O6RNIUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Our findings strongly supported the latter: narcissists, particularly those high in the antagonistic, rivalry facet of narcissism, report being ostracized more frequently.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HR76XF3DBVALRECSJ3A2MWY7DY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However her team made a striking discovery, finding that “it’s not just a matter of perception — narcissists are actually excluded more often,” Büttner said. Results showed “ostracism and narcissistic traits reinforce each other over time,” she said, meaning that for those cast out of a group dynamic, it can become a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHHERF536BFOFMUTRLH2X3XICY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers used data from &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jbnst-2018-0022/html" target="_blank"&gt;Germany’s Socio-Economic Panel&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running survey of approximately 22,000 households, and homed in on 1,592 people with higher narcissism scores.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Narcissistic traits were assessed based on a short form of the &lt;a href="http://www.persoc.net/persoc/uploads/Toolbox/NARQ_English.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between two subfacets — admiration and rivalry — with people grouped into personality types based on their responses to statements such as: “I deserve to be seen as a great personality”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and “Most people are somehow losers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NDTVDLJP5D53PSZTQDUN3ME2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Levels of ostracism were assessed based on responses to statements such as “Other people have ignored me” or “Other people have shut me out from conversations,”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;with participants asked to answer on a scale between 1 (meaning never) and 7 (always).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JUBU3BW56JA4NN3G3XYWVXM5VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers focused on whether people&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;had reported ostracism over a two-month period in 2015 and found that “individuals with higher levels of narcissism retrospectively report getting ostracized more frequently than individuals with lower levels of narcissism.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QWMBBWTNLBHGBD2SBBQZBCQDOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They also carried out six follow-up experiments involving&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;more than 2,500 people in total. One of these included a virtual ball-throwing game where two other players either included or excluded the participant. The participant was then asked to report on how many throws they had received and whether they felt they had actively participated in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XX3NIGE2RNBXVA6EZ6M2GMZTQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another experiment involved hypothetical discussions where the participant was told someone “must have forgotten” that they attended a concert together, and asked if they felt they had been excluded. Taken together, researchers said they found people with higher narcissism scores were more likely to perceive ambiguous social interactions as deliberately exclusionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DQKXA7F42FALBOYKH257B2NJ3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A final piece of the puzzle involved analyzing&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;14 years of data from a &lt;a href="https://osf.io/75snb/wiki/Publications/" target="_blank"&gt;national survey in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; of more than 72,000 people. It showed feelings of exclusion were followed by changes in narcissism levels a year later — and vice versa — demonstrating that “ostracism seems to solidify narcissistic traits over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N3CPQNQXYVHMDKVNRSYZGAURXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For Büttner, the most interesting takeaway was that not only do narcissists view themselves as victims of social exclusion, but their behavior actively contributes to it in a cycle that can “fuel the development of narcissistic traits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COI4VXBPMJCKRE27SSV6IKIJWU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This means that narcissists who are excluded may become even more narcissistic in response, potentially increasing their likelihood of future exclusion,” she said. “That’s an important insight because it suggests that ostracism doesn’t just happen &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; narcissists, instead, it seems to be part of a self-perpetuating cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KDDMA2US6VG7NEY2GY6W6JDB4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the research, said the findings back up previous findings that narcissists are “hypersensitive” to social exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UXAGE744YVB3RCHFQCJBCHCOOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We already know that narcissists tend to be selfish and lack empathy for others, and that over time they become less well-liked and cause conflict in their relationships,” she told The Washington Post in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JGYH5Z7RNZCYTCSXZ3HGCXQO6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The findings are in line with our previous research showing that narcissists can be paranoid that others mean them harm, even when there is no evidence for this. Our research suggests that this is due to narcissists’ constant need to defend their grandiose yet fragile sense of self — they are always on the lookout for ego-threat so they can deflect it quickly,” Hepper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CHE4ZXKWYNF6TPEZ7EIAIZKFUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner said one of the study’s main limitations was that while the team used&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;multiple methods like surveys, experiments and longitudinal data, most of the researchers’ findings relied on self-reported experience of ostracism. While experiments helped to bridge this gap, further observational research could be done to develop understanding, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I3TIFFKTARFDRBLOSELR5XLXWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another potential limitation to the new study’s findings was that narcissism was studied in healthy, student, community and representative samples, the research said, and severely narcissistic individuals may react differently.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Previous studies indicate that even small increases in narcissism have been shown to increase aggression, stop the forming of successful relationships and lead to mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQLLUQSLBBCQJPFJSKQNSCMJ74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, Büttner said the findings could have implications for managing conflict in large groups, such as the workplace or on social media. How to disrupt such behavioral patterns or prevent them occurring in the first place are also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“important questions for future research,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LMHCQY23OVCP7HB4BB7DQE6UZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner noted that narcissism is “a risk factor for downstream mental health consequences of ostracism, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PC3MSDA4ANBBTM2ESHNFSOR37U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Addressing these dynamics in structured ways, whether in workplaces, therapy, or social interactions, could help reduce the negative consequences of exclusion for both narcissistic individuals and those around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:08:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPS3JWYW1lb3V5Q3g3V1hzVHB2bVBCUGdMMzYyVExYbXZ1R1R4Q210MW9DUFIteUFkcDhlSldZMGhmMVI1Mlp4ZklUaW1xcXdQUzRUREZ4bWJCVUJ0QUFRRDFjc3UtamFJS0I5aV90RS1rSWhGN2pvSnpFamJtdjNZS19yX2xFMDZGbEpBMzNaNEt2RURZelBOb29TeWkzbDVE</guid></item><item><title>Narcissists are significantly more likely to feel excluded, new study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPaTExYVR0ajM2a3owU0dEZENRX0J6a2phRFlBRG8wZjRfSFRTMnNYOG40MUthWVV0MmRaMDZpN1VSLUxTVUVmUmdaQ0d4WTRpNlBnM0FRaDJhLVp2aC1YSFpqXzliOUgzVWZGSHBPbXRaY25oc1AxTFVfWGVvTjhEdFhBVjhLNUh1c1NmUk9VWnZvZElHcWdFUmZDRdIBkgFBVV95cUxQSXVBS2NmV3Y3R25oRnZWcnM0QUVBTXlRZ2RHRU9MdXVuT1B3SUVHbDcxdnhWVTM3bUxSU0wwaDMzbTJjczBmVThvUlFJRFVLMVR0RWFpQ21OaEg4N2x1WTJOUWRnTDQtdDgtRGxhdWo4aEVpVkVvNTVGUjF6cDB6Sm5ZZ2hBd01EWEg3ODdnQjBVdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Grandiose narcissists, also known as overt narcissists, are particularly notorious for their &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/health/narcissism-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;inflated sense of self-importance&lt;/a&gt; and relentless need for attention — traits that may match the description of someone you just thought of. Unlike covert narcissists, who mask their behavior with self-pity, grandiose narcissists rely on charm and manipulation to thrive.

            Now, a new study has found&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;grandiose narcissists are not only more likely to feel ostracized but are also genuinely excluded more often than those with less egocentric personalities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9fyf50006356m0ym5mzes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000547" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, examined 77,000 participants across multiple studies, controlled experiments and real-world scenarios, to identify why narcissists experience higher levels of exclusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7c9g2jf0009356m7x4pz9y6@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="how-narcissism-and-exclusion-fuel-one-another" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        How narcissism and exclusion fuel one another
&lt;/h3&gt;

            Narcissists often display disruptive behaviors in social settings, such as aggression or arrogance, that increase the likelihood of others distancing themselves over time. These self-absorbed individuals are also highly sensitive to social status and ambiguous cues, making them more likely to perceive exclusion even when it’s not happening, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000e356mlbqa4y4l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a very thin-skinned quality to narcissistic people, so if they even get a whiff that they are being left out, they’re going to be acutely aware of that,” said Los Angeles-based licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Ramani Durvasula, who treats people with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank"&gt;narcissistic personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; and has written several books on the topic, including “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-You-Identifying-Narcissistic/dp/0593492625" target="_blank"&gt;It’s Not You&lt;/a&gt;: Identifying and Healing From Narcissistic People.” “It’s picking up a glance or not liking a social media post.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000f356mwsnqkg8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Durvasula, who was not involved in the research, noted these perceived slights are usually unintentional — someone may simply be too busy to engage with a post or look away without realizing it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000g356mxhw8s2sr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when narcissists overreact to perceived acts of ostracism, friends, family members or colleagues may start avoiding them out of concern for their behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000h356mde911xn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To navigate relationships with narcissists, Durvasula recommends a strategy known as disengagement — intentionally withdrawing contact or interactions. Narcissists often interpret this behavior as exclusion, but it may be necessary for your mental health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000i356moxx4bw36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nevertheless, these actions create a destructive cycle identified in the study that explains how narcissism and ostracism fuel each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9lypf001p356mdetuiksi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists tend to view themselves as victims when they feel ostracized. This victim mentality intensifies their antagonistic behaviors, pushing people even further away, said Christiane Büttner, lead study author and social psychologist at Switzerland’s University of Basel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000j356mck6cmvv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This suggests that ostracism doesn’t just affect narcissists in the moment — it might shape their personality development in ways that perpetuate future exclusion,” Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000k356mkh4w5iae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study examined individuals who scored high on narcissism tests, it did not specifically focus on those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6710132/" target="_blank"&gt;pathological narcissism&lt;/a&gt;, Durvasula noted. She said she believes the effects of narcissism and exclusion would be even more extreme in individuals with clinical narcissistic personality disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000l356muwxfgy08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also found that individuals who exhibit narcissistic rivalry, viewing others as competition and acting more aggressively, are more likely to be ostracized than those with high levels of narcissistic admiration, who seek attention and status in socially engaging ways rather than isolating themselves, Büttner said. This pattern is particularly common in workplace dynamics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000m356m3ln8mn6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s actually a natural social perceptiveness narcissistic people have, which is why they can be quite successful in leadership and business,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000n356mmgpxvc8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, narcissists typically only use this skill when it benefits them and blame others in most situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9grj5000c356motpl0agu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissistic behaviors need to be addressed early on. This proactive approach is challenging because schools can attempt to enforce anti-bullying policies to counteract such behavior, but outside of the classroom, social exclusion is harder to control, Durvasula said, pointing to the example of a child not being invited to a birthday party.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0s000u356m5trmxaxk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that anti-bullying practices should be just as much about anti-ostracism behaviors to look out for the kid who may not be fitting in with peers as well and monitoring the situation,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000v356mmvpu7le3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If children don’t receive therapy for narcissistic traits, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to change as they enter adulthood, and narcissistic tendencies may intensify over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000w356myb6jxg66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To improve, narcissists need consistent intervention through therapy. Therapists must also be mindful of developmental traumas, childhood environment, attachment issues and any other psychological factors that may have shaped their narcissistic personality, according to Durvasula.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000x356msl6x7tw6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually the (final straw) that gets a narcissistic person to therapy is either sadness or anxiety, but they will still often pin it to something happening outside of them,” Durvasula said. “My boss is never fair to me, I can’t get promoted, I don’t have enough money, my spouse is mean to me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000y356my8abaeip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Social skills training or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; could help narcissists challenge assumptions that people are excluding them, while doing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation and reframing negative thoughts could help them develop healthier coping mechanisms to prevent future ostracism, Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7c9hi300010356macx4wbqt@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="handling-a-relationship-with-a-narcissist" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Handling a relationship with a narcissist

            The study primarily examined examples of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/health/energy-vampire-in-person-work-wellness/index.html"&gt;in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;, but Durvasula said dealing with a narcissist in a family or friend circle is often more challenging due to the deeper emotional history involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0015356m6a5jympj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether you’re navigating a work or personal relationship with a narcissist, Durvasula suggests empathic disengagement or yellow rocking, a strategy of remaining pleasant and polite in their presence without overperforming or sacrificing your mental well-being to satisfy them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0017356m8bq2klzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists in work and personal relationships create challenges for others who have to manage their disruptive behaviors and pick up more responsibilities because they can’t rely on them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0018356m90xr3qgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In work settings, this might look like a narcissist colleague not pulling their weight in a team of five. Other team members may hesitate to confront this person for fear of the reaction, ultimately picking up their share of the work instead, Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0019356mbqfx8vb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Family members face similar challenges, often creating backup plans to avoid last-minute chaos, as they can’t rely on a narcissist to follow through on commitments, such as picking someone up from the airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l001a356m5e9ht9w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when to disengage fully, Durvasula said it’s a personal decision. Some people may need to cut ties after just a few negative experiences, while family members might tolerate behavior for years or even decades from some narcissists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Nevertheless, these actions create a destructive cycle identified in the study that explains how narcissism and ostracism fuel each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9lypf001p356mdetuiksi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists tend to view themselves as victims when they feel ostracized. This victim mentality intensifies their antagonistic behaviors, pushing people even further away, said Christiane Büttner, lead study author and social psychologist at Switzerland’s University of Basel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000j356mck6cmvv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This suggests that ostracism doesn’t just affect narcissists in the moment — it might shape their personality development in ways that perpetuate future exclusion,” Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000k356mkh4w5iae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study examined individuals who scored high on narcissism tests, it did not specifically focus on those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6710132/" target="_blank"&gt;pathological narcissism&lt;/a&gt;, Durvasula noted. She said she believes the effects of narcissism and exclusion would be even more extreme in individuals with clinical narcissistic personality disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000l356muwxfgy08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also found that individuals who exhibit narcissistic rivalry, viewing others as competition and acting more aggressively, are more likely to be ostracized than those with high levels of narcissistic admiration, who seek attention and status in socially engaging ways rather than isolating themselves, Büttner said. This pattern is particularly common in workplace dynamics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000m356m3ln8mn6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s actually a natural social perceptiveness narcissistic people have, which is why they can be quite successful in leadership and business,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000n356mmgpxvc8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, narcissists typically only use this skill when it benefits them and blame others in most situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9grj5000c356motpl0agu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissistic behaviors need to be addressed early on. This proactive approach is challenging because schools can attempt to enforce anti-bullying policies to counteract such behavior, but outside of the classroom, social exclusion is harder to control, Durvasula said, pointing to the example of a child not being invited to a birthday party.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0s000u356m5trmxaxk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that anti-bullying practices should be just as much about anti-ostracism behaviors to look out for the kid who may not be fitting in with peers as well and monitoring the situation,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000v356mmvpu7le3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If children don’t receive therapy for narcissistic traits, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to change as they enter adulthood, and narcissistic tendencies may intensify over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000w356myb6jxg66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To improve, narcissists need consistent intervention through therapy. Therapists must also be mindful of developmental traumas, childhood environment, attachment issues and any other psychological factors that may have shaped their narcissistic personality, according to Durvasula.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000x356msl6x7tw6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually the (final straw) that gets a narcissistic person to therapy is either sadness or anxiety, but they will still often pin it to something happening outside of them,” Durvasula said. “My boss is never fair to me, I can’t get promoted, I don’t have enough money, my spouse is mean to me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000y356my8abaeip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Social skills training or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; could help narcissists challenge assumptions that people are excluding them, while doing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation and reframing negative thoughts could help them develop healthier coping mechanisms to prevent future ostracism, Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7c9hi300010356macx4wbqt@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="handling-a-relationship-with-a-narcissist" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Handling a relationship with a narcissist
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hdod000s356mfjkxp01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study primarily examined examples of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/health/energy-vampire-in-person-work-wellness/index.html"&gt;in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;, but Durvasula said dealing with a narcissist in a family or friend circle is often more challenging due to the deeper emotional history involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0015356m6a5jympj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether you’re navigating a work or personal relationship with a narcissist, Durvasula suggests empathic disengagement or yellow rocking, a strategy of remaining pleasant and polite in their presence without overperforming or sacrificing your mental well-being to satisfy them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0017356m8bq2klzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists in work and personal relationships create challenges for others who have to manage their disruptive behaviors and pick up more responsibilities because they can’t rely on them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0018356m90xr3qgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In work settings, this might look like a narcissist colleague not pulling their weight in a team of five. Other team members may hesitate to confront this person for fear of the reaction, ultimately picking up their share of the work instead, Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0019356mbqfx8vb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Family members face similar challenges, often creating backup plans to avoid last-minute chaos, as they can’t rely on a narcissist to follow through on commitments, such as picking someone up from the airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l001a356m5e9ht9w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when to disengage fully, Durvasula said it’s a personal decision. Some people may need to cut ties after just a few negative experiences, while family members might tolerate behavior for years or even decades from some narcissists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

It taps into a very real cultural moment where everyone seems obsessed with aging... and how to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While getting older is technically a good thing, it’s also understandable to want to look and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63497087/how-to-age-well-biohacking-longevity-tips/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63497087/how-to-age-well-biohacking-longevity-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="feel as young as possible" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;feel as young as possible&lt;/a&gt;.

The idea of "reverse aging," or turning back your actual "biological clock" (a.k.a. the age of your cells) is really buzzy right now thanks to a bevvy of longevity bros, biohacking podcasts, and a general trend towards preventative health practices. And a growing body of research suggests it may actually be possible—on some level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The idea of "reverse aging" is a little complicated, but doctors say that it is possible to hack your health to get the most out of your lifespan.

As mentioned, there has been some research on animals that seems to suggest it's possible. One study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.04.522507v1.full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.04.522507v1.full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bioRxiv" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2023 that found that a certain cocktail of proteins helped elderly mice live twice as long as their counterparts who didn’t get the cocktail. The mice who received the intervention also had DNA hallmarks that were similar to younger animals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another 2023 study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867422015707" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867422015707" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cell" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gave engineered mice (i.e. mice that have been genetically modified in a lab setting) a certain drug that altered their DNA. The mice were first given a drug to speed up their aging, and then given a cocktail that seemed to reverse some of those changes in their muscles, kidneys, and eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;And a 2024 study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867424009140" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867424009140" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cell" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that monkeys who were given a daily dose of metformin (a medication used to treat diabetes) had slower age-associated brain decline than those who didn’t get the drug. Those metformin-taking monkeys also had brain activity that was similar to monkeys that were about six years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But despite these interesting results, research on the concept of "reverse aging" is still ongoing, and scientists are limited to animal cell data at this point. “There is a long distance between local effects on cells and rejuvenating the entire body’s aging processes, which involve multiple cell types, organs, and function,” Dr. Tallia says. “For centuries, humans have been looking for the ‘Fountain of Youth,’ but it is fair to say that we aren’t there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-help-reverse-cell-aging" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to help reverse cell aging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Right now, there’s no magic drug or treatment that will help reverse your biological age, but doctors universally agree that certain lifestyle modifications can go a long way toward helping you to live a longer, healthier life—and even potentially look and feel better than you do now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;To be fair, if you're already health-conscious, none of these "hacks" are all that surprising, and Dr. Fudyma says they're really just “the basics” of good health. But given how essential these steps can be in protecting your cell health, they’re worth considering if you don't already have them in rotation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="20" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Aim for at least seven hours of quality sleep a night&lt;/strong&gt;. “This helps us recharge and restore several cellular functions,” Dr. Fudyma says. “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that restful sleep is also potentially helpful for reducing the risk of dementia.” FYI, this is a *minimum* amount. Everyone needs different amounts of sleep, but the general rule of thumb is that you should aim for between&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" seven to nine hours per night" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt; seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt;.

And establishing regular sleep patterns (consistent bedtime and wake-up times) is also important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Follow a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g27157249/high-protein-vegan-meals/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g27157249/high-protein-vegan-meals/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="plant-forward diet" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;plant-forward diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This doesn't mean you can't eat animal products. But you might consider following a Mediterranean-style diet (making sure to get plenty of fish), Dr. Mandelbaum says. Dr. Fudyma also recommends doing your best to limit &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ultra-processed foods" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; in your diet, along with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a20052150/is-red-meat-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a20052150/is-red-meat-bad-for-you/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="red meat" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Try to maintain a healthy weight&lt;/strong&gt;. Being overweight or having obesity can be hard on your body in multiple ways, and that stress will ultimately increase your biological age, Dr. Fudyma says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Get in 150+ minutes of exercise a week&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63797315/how-exercise-lowers-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63797315/how-exercise-lowers-dementia-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Physical activity is good for your brain" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Physical activity is good for your brain&lt;/a&gt; and your body, Mandelbaum points out. “When you exercise, you improve your brain function through Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF),” he says. Working out regularly can also lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, boost your memory, and lower your risk of depression—all of which can support a better biological age, he says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Cut back on alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;. “There’s &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598179/lies-about-alcohol/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598179/lies-about-alcohol/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="more and more evidence" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;more and more evidence&lt;/a&gt; coming out that links alcohol consumption to &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cancers" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="poor overall health" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;poor overall health&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Fudyma says. If you do drink alcohol, he recommends scaling back a little or even considering cutting it out entirely. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Don’t smoke&lt;/strong&gt;. “Smoking is definitely something that leads to biological aging,” Dr. Fudyma says. “It’s incredibly beneficial for the aging process to stop.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Slather on sunscreen&lt;/strong&gt;. Skin cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20clinical%20trials%2C%20and%20more." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20clinical%20trials%2C%20and%20more." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="most common" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; type of cancer in the US, making it really important to protect your skin. Dr. Tallia recommends using sunscreen regularly and doing your best to avoid spending too much time in the sun to lower your risk. This will keep your skin cells fresh and healthy (plus, fewer wrinkles!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Stay on top of your oral hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;. Chronic inflammation from poor oral hygiene can contribute to the aging process, Dr. Fudyma says. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10669972/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10669972/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has even linked bad oral health to a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Try to tamp down on stress&lt;/strong&gt;. Some level of stress is inevitable in life, but Dr. Fudyma says that doing what you can to dial it down by meditating or slowing down in general can be helpful. Emotional stress puts physical stress on your body and cells, which can increase your biological age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-can-you-really-reverse-your-age" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much can you really reverse your age?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There’s no hard and fast answer to how many years you can clip off your biological age, and doctors are hesitant to pinpoint an exact range.

Even for frail older adults—those at elevated risk of adverse health outcomes—greater activity was associated with lower dementia risks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers found dementia risk decreased with higher amounts of physical activity. Dementia risks were 60% lower in participants in the 35 to 69.9 minutes of physical activity/week category; 63% lower in the 70 to 139.9 minutes/week category; and 69% lower in the 140 and over minutes/week category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For their analysis, the researchers analyzed a dataset covering nearly 90,000 adults living in the U.K. who wore smart-watch-type activity trackers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was published online January 15 in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our findings suggest that increasing physical activity, even as little as five minutes per day, can reduce dementia risk in older adults,” says study lead author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3809/amal-asiri-wanigatunga"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amal Wanigatunga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, PhD, MPH, assistant professor in the Bloomberg School’s Department of Epidemiology. Wanigatunga is also a core faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health and has a joint appointment at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “This adds to a growing body of evidence that some exercise is better than nothing, especially with regard to an aging-related disorder that affects the brain that currently has no cure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dementia, usually from Alzheimer’s disease, is one of the most common conditions of old age. It is estimated to affect about seven million people in the U.S., including about a third of those who are 85 years or older. Although the risk of dementia rises with age, studies in recent years have suggested that dementia is somewhat preventable, within a normal lifespan, by lifestyle changes that include better control of cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar, and being more active.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The minimum amount of activity needed to reduce dementia risk meaningfully isn’t yet clear. For many older individuals, especially frail ones, the high amounts of exercise recommended in official guidelines are unattainable and may discourage any exercise at all. Both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.K. National Health System recommend that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week, an average of 20 minutes per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For their study, Wanigatunga analyzed data on British adults generated as part of the UK Biobank project, a long-running, ongoing study of approximately 500,000 individuals. The dataset for the new study covered 89,667 adults, mostly in their 50s and older, who used wrist-worn accelerometers to track their physical activity for a week during the period from February 2013 to December 2015. Follow-up of their health status extended for an average of 4.4 years, through November 2021, during which 735 of the participants were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The analysis compared individuals whose trackers showed some weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity to those whose trackers showed none and accounted for age and other medical conditions. The associations between higher activity and lower dementia risk were striking. Participants in the lowest activity category, ranging from one to 34.9 minutes per week, had an apparent risk reduction of about 41%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the researchers took into account participants who met their definitions of frailty or “pre-frailty,” they found that the association between more activity and less dementia was essentially unchanged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This suggests that even frail or nearly frail older adults might be able to reduce their dementia risk through low-dose exercise,” Wanigatunga says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wanigatunga notes that the study was not a clinical trial that established causation indicating that exercise reduces dementia risk, but its findings are consistent with that hypothesis. To check the possibility that their findings reflected undiagnosed dementia leading to lower physical activity, the researchers repeated their analysis but excluded dementia diagnoses in the first two years of follow-up. The association between more activity and lower dementia risk remained robust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wanigatunga and his colleagues recommend that future clinical trial-type studies investigate low-dose exercise as an important initial step towards increasing physical activity as a dementia-preventing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity at Any Dose Reduces All-Cause Dementia Risk Regardless of Frailty Status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” was co-authored by Amal Wanigatunga, Yiwen Dong, Mu Jin, Andrew Leroux, Erjia Cui, Xinkai Zhou, Angela Zhao, Jennifer Schrack, Karen Bandeen-Roche, Jeremy Walston, Qian-Li Xue, Martin Lindquist and Ciprian Crainiceanu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Funding for the study was provided by the National Institute on Aging (K01 AG076967, R01 AG075883).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;# # #&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="IT"&gt;Media contacts: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jonathan Eichberger &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:je@jhu.edu"&gt;&lt;span&gt;je@jhu.edu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span lang="IT"&gt;Kris Henry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:khenry39@jhu.edu"&gt;&lt;span lang="IT"&gt;khenry39@jhu.edu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="IT"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;                 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a growing number of scientific studies have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease isn't just a disease, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;it's an infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly spread&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing," &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324298"&gt;Dominy said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's important, because while &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg" alt="dentist checking x rays" class="wp-image-152675 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene? (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-gray-long-sleeve-shirt-holding-black-tablet-computer-v_2FRXEba94"&gt;Jonathan Borba/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that low levels of gingipains were evident even in people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's could be a smoking gun – suggesting they might have developed the condition if they had lived longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our identification of gingipain antigens in the brains of individuals with AD and also with AD pathology but no diagnosis of dementia argues that brain infection with &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; is not a result of poor dental care following the onset of dementia or a consequence of late-stage disease, but is an early event that can explain the pathology found in middle-aged individuals before cognitive decline," the authors explained &lt;a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau3333"&gt;in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a compound formulated by the company called COR388, showed in experiments with mice that it could reduce bacterial load of an established &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; brain infection, while also reducing amyloid-beta production and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have to wait and see what future research will uncover about this link, but the research community is cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Drugs targeting the bacteria's toxic proteins have so far only shown benefit in mice, yet with no new dementia treatments in over 15 years it's important that we test as many approaches as possible to tackle diseases like Alzheimer's," chief scientific officer David Reynolds from Alzheimer's Research commented in a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/bacteria-behind-gum-disease-linked-to-alzheimers/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau3333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story was published in January 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers developed a neural network model showing that people fine-tune their attention based on past experiences with distractions. Unlike traditional models that study one task with a single distraction, this study tested multiple simultaneous distractions, simulating real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people primarily adjust by suppressing previously distracting inputs rather than enhancing focus on a task.

To deal with this, a person could adjust their attention to downplay those crunch noises or focus their hearing on the speaker. But understanding how human brains do this has been a challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with a new neural network model, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have a better tool to uncover what brain mechanisms are at play when people need to focus amid many distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107902"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key innovation in this work is that usually researchers study this problem with only one source of relevant information and one source of distracting information. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model, now published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that people focus not by concentrating extra hard on a subject, but by ignoring inputs that were distracting in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous work showed that when people encounter a very difficult task, they adjust their attention to make them impervious to new distraction,” said study author Wouter Kool, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at WashU. “However, it remained unclear how they adjusted their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not that people may not do both forms of attention control — concentrate and reduce distractions — but how they do that can be affected by the difficulty of previous tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our work, previous difficulty also clearly affected their sensitivity to current difficulty,” Kool said, summarizing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key innovation in this work is that usually researchers study this problem with only one source of relevant information and one source of distracting information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this older work is the Stroop task, which includes a list of words for colors that can match or not match the color in which the word is printed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By investigating the delay in reaction time when participants are asked to name the color of mismatching words, researchers have created simple neural network models to understand how humans focus on tasks. But again, that’s one distraction, one task. Kool’s postdoctoral researcher Davide Gheza wanted to change it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We increased the sources of distraction, mimicking a cocktail party or a conference meeting,” Gheza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Stroop task that involves simple colored words, their task requires to choose among two complex stimuli with varying shapes, colors, borders and motion directions. This is meant to bring four total sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running participants through a series of trials where each of the four sources could be either the target task or one of the distractions, “we found strong evidence that people were really modulating their attention to the distractor and not so much to the target,” Kool said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People tune their attention very specifically,” he said. “If something or someone was distracting before, you learn to ignore them in the future, but you stay open to other inputs that might help complete the task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be testing this model on brain data collected while participants perform this task in an MRI scanner. Gheza and Kool believe this will help them pin down what specifically is happening in people’s brains while they encounter and overcome multiple sources of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was financially supported by a Multi-University Research Initiative grant (ONR/DoD N00014-23-1-2792) to Kool and by a McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience grant to Gheza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this attention and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c607f646d6a6a697e4c7b797f786022696879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Shaffer – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-02088-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distractor-specific control adaptation in multidimensional environments&lt;/a&gt;” by Wouter Kool et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distractor-specific control adaptation in multidimensional environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behaviour requires humans to constantly manage and switch between multiple, independent and conflicting sources of information. Conventional cognitive control tasks, however, only feature one task and one source of distraction. Therefore, it is unclear how control is allocated in multidimensional environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, we developed a multidimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use this task to test whether people adapt to previous conflict by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong evidence for the latter hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, control adaptation was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent trials, with no evidence for generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new neural network model shows that our results can only be simulated when including multiple independent conflict-detector units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results call for an update to classic models of cognitive control and their neurocomputational underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:58:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9sTGtONkdPZHNlZzlIcEZhaW8wN19aRnBuYkdoUnRGU2s0WjdTWDBwWGU0WWtFSldzamV4QlRGY29wU0hJSDQweXJNZVhDZkMtQXQxRzE1cHBJOUtfM09OMVdyQ1ZSS0pRc1R1SXY2czdqdmwyVjFtX0JR</guid></item><item><title>In Texas, vaccine-choice activists are ascendant - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxObjU2U1hIT0NZbG5tbHRELUU2UmhMbl9JT0NtUVBrN2FOQnhvZUVQcW1MM3d0R2FwSVhtZGg4d1Bkb2dlU2lvcXFfZ2l1cU1DeE9HMGVyY2FxM0c3U0xOeEthdktYeDI3WjRQc2x2amhmUkYxTzZ5cmhISzdQbXI1VDdESFNVdGNCYlQ1ZzMzN2xzQU1FNUd1SXIyQU1sa2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-80cr42 e1lrptjp2"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;n the oil&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;towns&lt;/small&gt; of west Texas a measles outbreak is spreading.

As well as being used in sweet foods and drinks, they are found in many savory products, such as ready meals, ketchups and sauces, and even bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most commonly used is aspartame, also known by its brand names, which include Nutrasweet®, Equal®, and Sugar Twin®. It is 200 times sweeter than sugar so, although it contains calories, much less is needed to give the same level of sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10822749/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that artificial sweeteners may have adverse health effects, particularly if consumed often. They have been associated with several health conditions, including affecting the functioning of the gastrointestinal system, causing headaches and taste alteration, and increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-071204" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (CVD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study investigating the effect of aspartame in mice has provided further evidence that it may contribute to CVD risk, and outlines how it might do this. The study found that aspartame triggered spikes in release of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323760" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; — the hormone that controls blood glucose — leading to the build up of fatty plaques, or &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:atherosclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125000063?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence linking aspartame consumption to increased risk of atherosclerosis through an insulin-mediated inflammatory pathway.

They also assessed the health of their blood vessels at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Insulin spikes after consuming aspartame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 30 minutes of consuming aspartame, the mice’s insulin levels increased significantly. The researchers noted that this was not surprising, given that there are sweetness-detecting receptors lining the mouths, intestines, and other tissues of both mice and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These receptors help guide insulin release after sugar is eaten. Aspartame, being 200 times sweeter than sugar, seemed to trick the receptors into triggering much higher insulin release.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not only directly after aspartame consumption that insulin levels were raised. Mice on the aspartame diet had persistently high insulin levels, suggesting that long-term consumption of this artificial sweetener may lead to &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/305567" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research adds to growing concerns about the metabolic effects of artificial sweeteners.

The data indicate that aspartame triggers insulin spikes via parasympathetic activation, leading to chronic hyperinsulinemia. This, in turn, upregulates CX3CL1, an immune signal that attracts inflammatory cells, exacerbating arterial plaque formation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 4 weeks of the aspartame diet, the mice started to develop atherosclerotic plaques in their arteries, which increased by the 8 and 12-week point. In mice fed sucrose, the plaques did not develop until the 12-week point, although these mice did gain weight and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/people/yihai-cao" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yihai Cao;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yihai Cao&lt;/a&gt;, who studies chronic diseases related to blood vessel disorders at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that the discovery of CX3CL1 was unexpected, but might help the development of more effective drugs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because [CX3CL1] is transmembrane protein, it will be locked on the endothelial cells lining in the inner layer of blood vessels. In this way, it can trap moving inflammatory cells in the blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi explained why replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners might not decrease risk of metabolic disorders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This mechanism could explain why diet soda drinkers, despite avoiding sugar, still show a heightened risk for metabolic diseases. Chronic insulin elevation is a well-known risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and the inflammatory response triggered by CX3CL1 may contribute to long-term cardiovascular damage.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limiting aspartame intake may benefit health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073617" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that he and his team plan to verify their findings in people.

These neurons, located in the ventral striatum, separately process better-than-expected and worse-than-expected outcomes. In experiments with mice, silencing these neurons altered their anticipation of rewards, affecting their decision-making behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that the brain tracks a full range of possible rewards, rather than just an average, which aligns with machine-learning models of decision-making. If confirmed in humans, the findings could explain difficulties in assessing risks seen in conditions like depression and addiction. Future research will explore how uncertainty influences this brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Neural Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; One group processes better-than-expected outcomes, while another tracks worse-than-expected ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision-Making Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain represents a full spectrum of possible rewards, not just averages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Clinical Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could help explain impaired risk assessment in conditions like depression and addiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day, our brain makes thousands of decisions, big and small. Any of these decisions — from the least consequential such as picking a restaurant to the more important such as pursuing a different career or moving to a new city — may result in better or worse outcomes.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the brain gauge risk and reward in making these calls? The answer to this question continues to puzzle scientists, but a new study carried out by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Harvard University offers intriguing clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107898"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These two groups of brain cells work together to form a representation of the full distribution of potential rewards for a decision. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published Feb. 19 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and supported in part by federal funding, incorporated machine-learning concepts into mouse experiments to study the brain circuitry that supports reward-based decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists uncovered two groups of brain cells in mice: one that helps mice learn about above-average outcomes and another associated with below-average outcomes. Together, the experiments showed, these cells allow the brain to gauge the full range of possible rewards associated with a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that mice — and by extension, other mammals — seem to be representing more fine-grained details about risk and reward than we thought before,” said co-senior author Jan Drugowitsch, associate professor of neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed in humans, the findings could provide a framework for understanding how the human brain makes reward-based decisions and what happens to the ability to judge risk and reward when reward circuitry fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning illuminates reward-based decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have long been interested in how the brain uses past experiences to make new decisions. However, according to Drugowitsch, many traditional theories about such decision-making fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugowitsch uses the example of selecting a restaurant: If you’re in the mood to play it safe, you might choose a restaurant with a menu that experience tells you is reliably good, and if you feel like taking a risk, you might opt for a restaurant that you know offers a mix of exceptional and subpar dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the restaurants differ considerably in their range of offerings, yet existing neuroscience theories consider them equivalent when averaged, and thus predict an equal likelihood of choosing either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that this is not how humans and animals act — we can decide between seeking risks and playing it safe,” Drugowitsch said. “We have a sense of more than just average expected rewards associated with our choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, machine-learning researchers developed a theory of decision-making that better captures the full range of potential rewards linked to a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They incorporated this theory into a new machine-learning algorithm that outperformed alternative algorithms in Atari video games and a range of other tasks in which each decision has multiple possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They basically asked what happens if rather than just learning average rewards for certain actions, the algorithm learns the whole distribution, and they found it improved performance significantly,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;paper, Naoshige Uchida, professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, and colleagues reanalyzed existing data to explore whether this machine-learning theory applied to neuroscience, in the context of decision-making in rodent brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that in mice, activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine — which plays a role in reward-seeking, pleasure, and motivation — corresponded to reward-learning signals predicted by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Drugowitsch said, the work suggested that the new algorithm was better at explaining dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How mouse brains represent a range of rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Drugowitsch teamed up with co-senior author Uchida to take the research a step further. Together, they designed mouse experiments to see how this process plays out in a brain region called the ventral striatum, which stores information about possible rewards associated with a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine activity only provides the learning signal for expected rewards, but we wanted to find representations of these learned rewards directly in the brain,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained mice to associate different odors with rewards of varying magnitudes — in essence, teaching mice the range of possible outcomes of a choice. They then presented the mice with odors, and observed licking behavior (mice lick more in anticipation of better rewards) while recording neural activity in the ventral striatum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team identified two distinct groups of neurons in the brain: One that helps a mouse learn about better-than-expected outcomes and another tied to worse-than-expected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can think of this as having an optimist and a pessimist in your brain, both giving you advice on what to do next,” Drugowitsch explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers silenced the “optimistic” neurons, the mouse exhibited behavior suggesting that it anticipated a less appealing reward. Conversely, when the researchers silenced the “pessimistic” neurons, the mouse behaved as if it expected a higher value treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These two groups of brain cells work together to form a representation of the full distribution of potential rewards for a decision,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers see many future directions for their work, including how the brain makes decisions when there is more uncertainty about what each initial option represents and how their findings apply to more general reasoning about the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugowitsch noted that more research is needed to confirm the results in humans and to adapt the findings to the complexity of human decision-making. However, based on the parallels between mouse and human brains, he believes the work may already shed some light on how humans assess risk in decisions and why people with certain conditions such as depression or addiction may struggle with such assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship, funding, disclosures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors on the paper include Adam Lowet, Qiao Zheng, Melissa Meng, and Sara Matias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01NS116753; F31NS124095), the Human Frontier Science Program (LT000801/2018), the Harvard Brain Science Initiative, and the Brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this decision-making and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5135343f3f38220e3f34303d3e3f11393c227f393023273023357f343524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dennis Nealon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dennis Nealon – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08488-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;An opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Jan Drugowitsch et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:35:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5LMEFBbFNmNEU2M2tGNkJtQVRsaDN2RFQ4eHB2QVFmQXhTMVZlSnZud2FhZ19wVU95QndRdndTQkwzOGVfZ1lraG5jSzlsdWx2czNpSlNPRkxaUHBnUWJsRkJKZ1B1SVFFVWpxTWRKcU0xX1U1NzJsSXdR</guid></item><item><title>Why Is This Indonesian Volcano Spewing Blue Lava Instead of Red?

&lt;p&gt;In the eastern reaches of &lt;strong&gt;Java, Indonesia&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Kawah Ijen&lt;/strong&gt; volcano stuns the world with a spectacle of &lt;strong&gt;neon-blue flames&lt;/strong&gt; lighting up its crater at night. While it appears as if the volcano is spewing &lt;strong&gt;blue lava&lt;/strong&gt;, the truth is even more fascinating. This rare phenomenon, combined with one of the &lt;strong&gt;most acidic lakes on Earth&lt;/strong&gt; and a grueling sulfur mining industry, makes Kawah Ijen one of the most extraordinary and perilous volcanic sites on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Science Behind the Blue Flames&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the mesmerizing sight, the &lt;strong&gt;blue glow&lt;/strong&gt; seen at Kawah Ijen is not actual lava, reports &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-does-indonesian-volcano-burn-bright-blue-180949576/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Smithsonianmag&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it results from the &lt;strong&gt;combustion of sulfuric gases&lt;/strong&gt;. When sulfur-rich gases escape from the volcano’s cracks at temperatures reaching &lt;strong&gt;600°C (1,112°F)&lt;/strong&gt;, they ignite upon contact with oxygen, producing vibrant &lt;strong&gt;blue flames&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;molten sulfur&lt;/strong&gt; continues to burn as it flows down the slopes, creating the illusion of glowing&lt;strong&gt; blue rivers&lt;/strong&gt;. This spectacle is only visible at night since daylight overpowers the &lt;strong&gt;luminescent effect&lt;/strong&gt;. While other volcanoes worldwide also release sulfuric gases, Kawah Ijen’s chemical composition and gas concentrations make this phenomenon particularly intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The World’s Most Acidic Crater Lake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the summit of Kawah Ijen lies a surreal &lt;strong&gt;turquoise crater lake&lt;/strong&gt;, which holds the title of the largest acidic lake on Earth. Its extreme acidity is due to &lt;strong&gt;high levels&lt;/strong&gt; of sulfuric and hydrochloric acid, giving it a pH as low as &lt;strong&gt;0.13 in its center&lt;/strong&gt;—so acidic that it can dissolve metals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lake isn’t just a scientific &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/nasa-curiosity-rover-captures-clouds-mars/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79093" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;curiosity&lt;/a&gt;; it’s also a source of environmental concern. The &lt;strong&gt;Banyupahit River&lt;/strong&gt;, which originates from the lake, carries its acidic waters downstream, affecting aquatic life and vegetation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its stunning appearance, the lake is &lt;strong&gt;extremely dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;, and prolonged exposure to its acidic fumes can cause &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/8-signs-your-mental-health-is-declining/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75990" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;severe health issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Harsh Reality of Sulfur Mining&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its natural beauty, Kawah Ijen is a working volcano, where hundreds of &lt;strong&gt;sulfur miners&lt;/strong&gt; risk their lives daily. The volcano’s fumeroles release thick clouds of &lt;strong&gt;toxic gases&lt;/strong&gt;, and miners use&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/danger-in-the-pipes-drinking-water-map-reveals-states-worst-hit-by-lead-contamination/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73589" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; simple pipes&lt;/a&gt; to channel and condense the sulfur, allowing it to solidify into bright yellow blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These workers then break the sulfur by hand and carry loads of up to &lt;strong&gt;90 kilograms (200 lbs)&lt;/strong&gt; down the steep crater—sometimes multiple times per day. Without proper protective equipment, many suffer from &lt;strong&gt;respiratory diseases&lt;/strong&gt; due to prolonged exposure to hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With an &lt;strong&gt;average life expectancy of only 40 years&lt;/strong&gt;, these miners endure some of the harshest working conditions in the world, making Kawah Ijen not just a place of natural wonder, but also of human struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Balance Between Tourism and Conservation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blue flames of Kawah Ijen have become a major tourist attraction, drawing adventurers from all over the world. Guided treks begin in the early hours of the morning, allowing visitors to witness the mesmerizing blue glow before sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;strong&gt;rising popularity of the site&lt;/strong&gt; comes with environmental and safety concerns. Unregulated tourism and increasing foot traffic threaten the delicate ecosystem of the &lt;strong&gt;acidic lake and sulfur fields&lt;/strong&gt;. At the same time, tourists venturing too close to the flames without proper gas masks risk severe &lt;strong&gt;respiratory distress&lt;/strong&gt; from the toxic fumes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Efforts are being made to ensure that conservation measures are put in place while allowing sustainable tourism, but striking this balance remains a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Place of Danger and Wonder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawah Ijen is a land of extremes, where &lt;strong&gt;fire burns blue, water is acid&lt;/strong&gt;, and miners battle&lt;strong&gt; deadly gases daily&lt;/strong&gt;.

It is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with around one million deaths and two million new cases reported in 2020. This disease primarily affects people over 50, and its increasing prevalence poses a growing challenge to healthcare systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRC originates in the colon or rectum, where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and can spread to other organs, such as the liver and lungs. Conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, are often accompanied by significant side effects like immunosuppression, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-develop-worlds-first-universal-gene-therapy-for-anemia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anemia&lt;/a&gt;, and organ toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, cancer cells frequently develop resistance to these drugs, diminishing their effectiveness. These challenges highlight an urgent need for safer, more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research offers hope by exploring alternative treatments derived from natural compounds.

The plant is known for its greenish-silver leaves and strong aromatic scent. It has long been valued in traditional medicine for its diverse therapeutic properties, including &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fish-guts-could-be-the-future-of-skin-care-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibacterial&lt;/a&gt;, antifungal, antispasmodic, and vasorelaxant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret behind these medicinal properties lies in its rich phytochemical composition. The plant contains a variety of compounds, including flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, monoterpenoids, and essential oils. These natural chemicals are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic effects. They not only boost the immune system but also demonstrate significant anticancer properties by targeting cancer cells selectively, leaving healthy cells unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.sharjah.ac.ae/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sharjah&lt;/a&gt; revealed that an extract from Artemisia herba-alba exhibited strong anti-cancer properties against colorectal cancer cells. Published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.4715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, the research highlights the plant’s potential to disrupt cancer cell growth and induce cell death without harming normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results suggest that Artemisia herba-alba has great potential as a new tool in fighting CRC (colorectal cancer),” said Dr. Lara Bou Malhab, the study’s lead author and research associate at Sharjah University’s Research Institute for Medical and Health Sciences. “It could be a promising natural ingredient for new cancer treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_artemisia_herba_alba_targets_cancer_cells"&gt;How Artemisia herba-alba Targets Cancer Cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved extracting active compounds from the aerial parts of Artemisia herba-alba collected from southern Jordan. After drying and grinding the plant material into fine powder, researchers used a methanol-based extraction process to obtain the highest concentration of phytochemicals. This extract was then tested on eight different colorectal cancer cell lines to evaluate its impact on cancer cell growth, survival, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The effect of A. herba-alba extract on different cell cycle regulatory and apoptotic markers proteins.

The extract not only inhibited the growth of cancer cells but also triggered apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death crucial for eliminating cancer cells. It disrupted the cell cycle by reducing the activity of proteins like Cyclin B1 and CDK1, which are essential for cancer cell division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the extract blocked the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, a key driver of cancer development and progression. This pathway plays a significant role in cell survival, proliferation, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-mrna-vaccine-revolutionizes-pancreatic-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism in cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;. By inhibiting this pathway, Artemisia herba-alba effectively starved the cancer cells of the signals they need to grow and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current study underscores the extract's selective cytotoxicity against CRC cell lines, highlighting its potential to serve as a complementary treatment to existing cancer therapies,” Dr. Bou Malhab explained. “Our findings highlight the immense potential of Artemisia herba-alba as a natural source for developing innovative therapies against colorectal cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_frontier_in_cancer_treatment"&gt;A New Frontier in Cancer Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of Artemisia herba-alba's anticancer properties is significant for several reasons. First, it offers a potential alternative to traditional chemotherapy, which often causes severe side effects and faces issues of drug resistance. Natural compounds like those found in Artemisia herba-alba provide a more targeted and less toxic approach to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The effect of A. herba-alba on different cell death markers p-AKT and p-mTOR. (CREDIT: Food Science and Nutrition) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, this study emphasizes the importance of exploring traditional medicinal plants as sources of new therapeutic agents. In many cultures, Artemisia herba-alba has been used for centuries to treat a range of health issues, including fever, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory problems. Its potential as an anticancer agent not only validates traditional knowledge but also opens up new avenues for scientific exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s success is also credited to the collaboration between researchers from the University of Sharjah and the University of Jordan. The botanical identification of the plant specimens was conducted by Prof. M. Hudaib, an expert in Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry at the &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ju.edu.jo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Jordan's School of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers emphasized the importance of further investigation to fully understand the molecular mechanisms behind Artemisia herba-alba's anticancer effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bou Malhab stressed the need for continued research to explore the clinical efficacy of Artemisia herba-alba, stating, “Our findings demonstrate its cytotoxic effects, ability to induce apoptosis, and its capacity to arrest the cell cycle. This suggests a wider therapeutic significance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_future_of_artemisia_herba_alba_in_cancer_therapy"&gt;The Future of Artemisia herba-alba in Cancer Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential of Artemisia herba-alba as a natural anti-cancer agent is groundbreaking. As CRC cases continue to rise worldwide, there is an urgent need for treatments that are not only more effective but also less harmful than conventional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed through further research and clinical trials, Artemisia herba-alba could become an essential component of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/study-links-coffee-to-cancer-heart-disease-and-parkinsons-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It might be used in combination with existing treatments to enhance their effectiveness and reduce side effects. Additionally, its natural origin could lead to more affordable cancer treatments, making them accessible to a broader population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the journey from laboratory research to clinical application is long and complex. More in-depth studies are required to understand the exact mechanisms of its anticancer action, optimal dosage, and potential side effects. The researchers call for extensive preclinical and clinical trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of Artemisia herba-alba in treating colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where cancer remains one of the leading &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/groundbreaking-cancer-treatment-destroys-99-of-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;causes of death&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of new, effective, and safe treatments is a beacon of hope. Artemisia herba-alba, an ancient remedy, may well be the key to modern cancer therapy, providing a natural and powerful weapon against one of the deadliest forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPbG1SaGlybmU4dEhKTVJuRTdqVlpTNk5RNnVOTEZKa3NrQUg3SFFaRDVrSjJaRTlzdEhNR3dKWXVvMS1pZ0JsaXVBQVlvNjg3emROeC1ORndacDBhYzJJZklBYzQzd2w2bFlsbDdlWmlRX1l1LVpzM1AzeTQ4YXVzOFg1dDBFRmo1Y25sWS1QRE0wemtweDU4QWdTTE5Ndw</guid></item><item><title>Valley man's near-amputation sparks warning for Black Arizonans - ABC15 Arizona in Phoenix</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQemZSRHlYNGtQYjFYYnFKME1teEE4eHY2MjZaRU0zaVVWUHBRTEZrejNGMGRwX1g1QzJkdGctel91MEoteTJ2WnAtcHVoMmVnM0NHSE9EdWtsNHlfaXVGWDBVZElITHVBNm9GdjEwaUJxOTZjUGl2QS14S19XSFlLekFBOVlYSW1PQk9qQjczSkF0Q2FLS3ZaR2lsQU0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURPRISE, AZ — A nagging foot wound that wouldn’t heal turned into a life-altering diagnosis for Gregg Province, a Surprise man who is now raising awareness about Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.), a serious but often underdiagnosed circulatory condition that disproportionately impacts Black Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Province thought his non-healing foot wound was just a minor issue when he visited the podiatrist, but doctors discovered a 99% blockage in one of his lower leg arteries. He needed immediate surgery or risked amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The doctor] looked at the foot and said, told Lynn, take him to the emergency room now," Province recalled the physician telling his wife. "I didn’t know what was going on until I woke up from surgery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/peripheral-artery-disease#:~:text=Language%20switcher&amp;amp;text=Also%20called%20peripheral%20arterial%20disease,other%20parts%20of%20the%20body." data-cms-ai="0"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;, Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) occurs when fatty deposits build up in the arteries reducing blood flow to the limbs, most commonly the legs. If left untreated, patients risk amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about the limbs, P.A.D. is strongly linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. The disease is most common in Black Americans, affecting nearly 1 in 10 over age 40, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/facts-about-peripheral-artery-disease-pad" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Province never thought he was at any risk given he was active in his younger years—playing basketball, tennis, and softball—but as he aged, his activity level decreased while his love for treats, like double chocolate muffins and potato chips, didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought I was the cat’s meow, playing sports," Gregg laughed. “But my vices caught up to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After surgery to clear his arteries, Banner Health’s Dr. Ankur Shukla prescribed lifestyle changes and physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first sign that people will complain of is that they will say, 'Hey, Doc, when I'm walking to the grocery store, my legs start to cramp up,' or 'Hey, when I'm going out to the mailbox, my leg starts to cramp up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Dr. Shukla said P.A.D. is manageable, especially if it's caught early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg’s wife, Lynn, came to Dr. Shukla was pages full of questions after the surgery and came away from it with a renewed drive to focus on her and her husband's physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I told him, ‘I can want this for you, but if you don’t want it for yourself, there’s nothing I can do,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was Gregg’s wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with Lynn’s support, he’s walking regularly, watching his diet, and spreading the message to others—especially Black Arizonans—about the importance of early detection and not ignoring your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The doctor can’t fix everything wrong with us. We have to fix it upstairs first—and just don’t wait," Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing leg pain or wounds that won’t heal, talk to your doctor today—early intervention could save your limb or even your life.&lt;/p&gt;

EatingWell design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronica Rouse, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Easy Steps To Lower Cholesterol &lt;/em&gt;points out a study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complete protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Full-Fat Dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but new research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A 2023 review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.” Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Shellfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but moderate coffee consumption (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to heart-health benefits. Rouse states, “A 2022 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a nutrient-packed vegetable loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cocoa is rich in flavonoids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips for Supporting Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:25 to 36 grams of fiber per day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on soluble fiber sources, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to prioritize omega-3 fatty acids from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out some foods with a bad reputation can actually have surprising heart-health benefits. Eggs, full-fat dairy, shellfish, coffee, potatoes and dark chocolate can all be part of a heart-friendly diet when enjoyed in moderation and prepared in healthy ways.

EatingWell design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;1. Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronica Rouse, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Easy Steps To Lower Cholesterol &lt;/em&gt;points out a study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complete protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Full-Fat Dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but new research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A 2023 review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.” Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Shellfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but moderate coffee consumption (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to heart-health benefits. Rouse states, “A 2022 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;5. Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a nutrient-packed vegetable loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;6. Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cocoa is rich in flavonoids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Other Tips for Supporting Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:25 to 36 grams of fiber per day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on soluble fiber sources, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to prioritize omega-3 fatty acids from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turns out some foods with a bad reputation can actually have surprising heart-health benefits. Eggs, full-fat dairy, shellfish, coffee, potatoes and dark chocolate can all be part of a heart-friendly diet when enjoyed in moderation and prepared in healthy ways.

Rats fed the Med diet’s mix of olive oil, fish and fibre showed increases in four beneficial types of gut bacteria, compared to rats eating a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These bacterial changes were linked to improvements in memory tasks, learning and ‘cognitive flexibility’: the ability to adapt to new information. The study also found some slight improvements in the rat’s spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Spatial memory is important because getting lost is one of the first signs of Alzheimer’s and we know from large population studies that people who eat a Med diet have a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/mother-dementia-85-eat-reduce-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced incidence of dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduced incidence of dementia&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr Faye Begeti, a neurology doctor and neuroscientist at Oxford University Hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More research in humans is needed but its findings add to increasingly compelling evidence of the importance of the complex links between the gut and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So how can we cultivate a healthy gut that will also help to boost our brain’s cognitive skills? Here are seven things to try, based on the latest research and what the experts advise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;1. Eat your greens to reduce cognitive decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating one to two servings of green leafy vegetables daily is associated with slower cognitive decline - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Granny was right to emphasise the importance of eating up your &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/green-mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dark, leafy greens;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;dark, leafy greens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a US &lt;a class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5772164/#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of men and women aged between 58 and 99 years old, eating one to two servings of green leafy vegetables daily was associated with slower cognitive decline, with the group who ate their green veg having brains that were cognitively 11 years younger than those who didn’t eat regular greens. The greens that were eaten included spinach, kale, collards and lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The diversity of plant foods also matters for our gut/brain health. “The more types of fibre and polyphenols we consume, the better our gut microbes can thrive – this is why eating a variety of plant-based foods (rather than just focusing on one or two specific ones) is so important,” says Dr Caitlin Hall, a neuroscientist and dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Eat probiotics to boost your memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chickpeas are a great source of prebiotics - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a class="link " href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424099/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by King’s College London last year, researchers found that adults aged over 60 who were given a prebiotic supplement rich in inulin performed better in memory tests used to capture early signs of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We can’t digest prebiotic fibres ourselves, but they feed our gut microbes, helping them to produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the UK we’re missing about 35 per cent of the fibre we should be eating, and prebiotic fibres are particularly useful for our guts. In studies, we tend to use supplements as it’s easier to isolate that ingredient, but ideally, we want to look at a food-first approach. Inulin, for example, is found in asparagus, leeks, onions and garlic,” says Dr Emily Leeming, a dietitian, scientist and author of &lt;em&gt;Genius Gut: The Life-Changing Science of Eating for your Second Brain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Legumes such as chickpeas, lentils and beans are also a good source of brain-boosting prebiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Drink kefir for improve your memory and mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be wroth making kefir yourself, as not all commercial brands contain traditional grains - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two interesting studies have shown that drinking kefir, a fermented milk, is beneficial for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the first &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1028415X.2022.2046963" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, adults who drank the milk for four weeks improved their “relational memory”. “This is the type of memory that helps you to remember where your keys are and people’s faces and names,” Dr Leeming explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the second &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(13)00292-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers did brain scans on women who drank kefir twice daily for four weeks and then showed them negative and positive images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The researchers were looking at their emotional reactions, and they discovered that those drinking kefir had less of an emotional reaction to the negative images, which suggests that the fermented drink was making them more emotionally resilient. Mouse studies have also shown that consuming kefir grains seems to boost the neurotransmitters involved in reducing stress and anxiety,” Dr Leeming explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kefir is readily available to buy, although Dr Leeming suggests making it yourself, as not all commercial brands contain traditional grains. “You can easily buy the kefir grains, add them to milk, leave them for a day or so, and then strain,” she says. You can try kefir as a drink, have it with cereal, add it to your yogurt, or use it to make a creamy, tangy salad dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Have berries to help you focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries are a great source of polyphenols, along with dark chocolate, coffee and tea - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Berries are rich in polyphenols and flavonoids are good for focus, fatigue and your brain’s processing speed, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/are-smoothies-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:berry smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;berry smoothie&lt;/a&gt; at 9am could help your brain stay sharp throughout the day, one &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2685#B31-nutrients-11-02685" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests. In the research, one group had a smoothie with berries blended in, and the other had a placebo. By 3pm, the placebo group were experiencing the traditional afternoon energy slump, but the group who drank the berry smoothie maintained their energy, focus and mental performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another &lt;a class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8180591/#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; analysed how polyphenols impact cognition and found that they improved ‘visual information processing speed’ which is how fast your brain can take in and interpret what your eyes see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Polyphenols are also found in dark chocolate, extra virgin olive oil, coffee, tea and many fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;5. Eat breakfast to feed your brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Our brain is our most energy-hungry organ in our body, consuming 20 per cent of our energy daily, so it’s important not to skip a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Multiple studies have shown that adults who skip breakfast tend to have a lower mood and eat less fibre, which is already a problem. Even having something small is going to be a supporting start to our day, and good for our microbes,” says Dr Leeming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Aim for a balance of protein and healthy fats for stable blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;6. Pack in omega-3 to feed your gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oily fish, such as salmon, are packed with omega-3s which help feed our brains - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research shows eating fish supports brain structure and reduces inflammation, thanks to DHA, a type of omega-3 found in high levels in fish. Yet in the UK we have low levels of omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Omega-3s have a direct influence on the cell membranes of our brains, but they’re also recognised as a potential prebiotic, having a similar effect to fibre in terms of feeding our gut microbes,” says Dr Leeming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Omega-3 is also found in walnuts and chia seeds, but this form is harder for our bodies to absorb than the DHA found in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Non-vegetarians should aim for two portions of fish a week and if you’re a vegetarian, look into an omega-3 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why reducing stress is also important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your gut and brain health isn’t just about what’s on your plate. “Because the gut and brain are so interconnected via the gut-brain axis, &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/toxic-stress-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; can also alter the gut microbiome, reducing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help protect against inflammation in the brain.

    &lt;p&gt;Research shows eating fish supports brain structure and reduces inflammation, thanks to DHA, a type of omega-3 found in high levels in fish. Yet in the UK we have low levels of omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega-3s have a direct influence on the cell membranes of our brains, but they’re also recognised as a potential prebiotic, having a similar effect to fibre in terms of feeding our gut microbes,” says Dr Leeming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 is also found in walnuts and chia seeds, but this form is harder for our bodies to absorb than the DHA found in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-vegetarians should aim for two portions of fish a week and if you’re a vegetarian, look into an omega-3 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why reducing stress is also important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut and brain health isn’t just about what’s on your plate. “Because the gut and brain are so interconnected via the gut-brain axis, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/toxic-stress-risk/"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; can also alter the gut microbiome, reducing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help protect against inflammation in the brain. Managing stress through movement and mindfulness doesn’t just improve digestion—it actively supports memory, focus, and long-term brain health,” says Dr Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So find stress relief that works for you. That might be breathwork, yoga or even just regular five-minute screen breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is also a proven stress reliever.

After the doctors ran CT and MRI scans of his head, they were shocked to find a huge pocket of fluid where his brain was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In scans shared with medical journal The Lancet, the main part of the man's brain area appears black, indicating where the build up of fluid was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man discovered he had been living with just half a brain after being hit by leg pain. The above image shows a build up of fluid - the black area - where his brain was mean to be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drainage tubes in the patient's brain had narrowed, causing a build up of fluid to accumulate over the decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This caused his brain to squeeze into a narrow layer pushed against the rim of his skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, his skull had also enlarged. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case, Lionel Feuillet, a neurologist at the Mediterranean University in Marseilles, said at the time the case report was published in 2004: 'We were very surprised when we looked for the first time the CT scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The brain was very, very much smaller than normal. This case is unique to our knowledge.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Feuillet said that his team had 'never encountered such severe hydrocephalus before' and it is likely the man had the condition from birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to see how his condition had affected his mental ability, the doctors carried out a series of psychological tests on the male patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were further surprised to find that he was still able to function sufficiently with an IQ of 75, at the lower end of the 'normal' range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man also had built a successful life for himself, with a wife, two children and a job as a civil servant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After treatment, the man made a complete recovery although subsequent scans showed no change to the size of his brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scans revealed only a narrow rim of brain material pressed against the man's skull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Feuillet said that the problems with his left leg were a neurological symptom of the man's brain condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, hydrocephalus or 'water on the brain' affects one out of every 770 babies, making it as common as Down syndrome and more common than spina bifida or brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is most common in both infants and older adults and it can be asymptomatic, which explains why the man went for years without noticing an impact to his health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the common symptoms, when they do surface, include h&lt;span&gt;eadaches, n&lt;/span&gt;ausea and vomiting, difficulty walking, vision problems, memory problems, incontinence and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment is shunt surgery and if it is left&lt;span&gt; untreated, hydrocephalus can be fatal due to increased pressure compressing the brainstem, which is responsible for regulating heart rates and breathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A patient's prognosis after surgery depends on their age and general health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After treatment, the man made a complete recovery although subsequent scans showed no change to the size of his brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:22:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Man, 44, learns he's been living with half a BRAIN after subtle sign - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNeldjRGI4dmVmVGpTVHRBdTk2aE5WS0JlekpCLUpHSjZYSVViTGRwX0liZjlXTHJDa3cwd2d1LUVveVZrZVg1c0VFQ2gyb3lzZXJXdG9KTmlSTjVBeUs1eGdkQ2hwRjM1cDZ0T0hBU0pPc0sxLVpuVXBPdzdSbEp4a08xbkVPekZ3UDY5NHdwVU1YZ3JjbnIwbkZ0dlJmREFwa05ya0RTTTdYNXEwbmhYX2FpMDBHRzZ2aFE3UmZ0VVc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man discovered he had been living with just half a brain after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14405067/teens-stomach-sign-deadly-brain-tumour-left-week-live.html"&gt;being hit by a common symptom&lt;/a&gt; that plagues millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unnamed 44-year-old from the south of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/france/index.html" id="mol-e0ec9db0-eed6-11ef-8420-3fb9a6b84a55" class=""&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; started feeling a mild pain and weakness in his leg for around two weeks, which prompted him to visit his doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a third of Americans suffer from some form of leg pain, which is usually down to muscle strain, arthritis or harder-to-identify causes, like vascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After doctors ruled out those common physical causes, they were concerned it could be due &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14406171/Killer-disease-paralysis-brain-swelling-Britain-ticks.html"&gt;to a neurological condition&lt;/a&gt; that affects nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there weren't any notable abnormalities in his medical history, they noticed that he had had a shunt surgery when he six months old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A shunt surgery - which involves implanting a thin tube into the brain to drain away excess fluid to another part of the body - was performed as he had an excess buildup of fluid on his brain but there was no cause identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shunt was then removed when he was 14 years old.

(Vercammen was not involved in the new study.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering these treatments should have an "in-depth conversation" with a doctor about the potential benefits and weigh them against the "significant risks" involved, according to Vercammen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These risks include the possibility of serious side effects, such as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain swelling and bleeding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain swelling and bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the substantial financial costs associated with treatment, even if you have insurance coverage," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who may benefit from these treatments, Hartz recommended they talk to their doctors and review the potential risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This information could help contextualize how the medications may benefit them in terms of independence," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the makers of Leqembi and Kisunla to request comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/two-alzheimers-drugs-help-patients-live-independently-home-longer-periods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Two Alzheimer’s drugs help patients live independently at home for longer periods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Two Alzheimer’s drugs help patients live independently at home for longer periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1hLW1CMkVUemlWN0hnXzJCUGQyTlF2YnFCdk5rcW1fbGU1XzVaeUlVLTlWb1dGbXZrRlZSc2QtMDVIUU4ySHJoaVJPclBBRWxNaTRaMFM4Yi1teXhYMXZSQlhPb0g3eDhTbWdzb0pDMnc1Wi1xVUVr</guid></item><item><title>New Five-Type Index Provides Doctors Guide for Long COVID - Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNd1lBSVRSQ0ZpMkdMZ0wtRk9WdnJXdHNsX295VTJyRmlYWG9GXy1uREtOTEJuZDU4dWdYaTZEM2o4OEJvT0V5Q1d4ejR3d0I3cV92OGFPUTZlNlQxQVpCeWxvY1pEUGEyRHMwRnY2TzBTZEVEZnpuekUzc18wV2VCWm9ZanV0cU1JRXVQdXRCaTJ2MlZBeDZGUVBaSW11RFJOeV9Hc0tR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of long COVID patients has identified five distinct subtypes that researchers say will help doctors diagnose the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2828329?guestAccessKey=77bdd800-1217-41f0-bada-33a43d62bde1&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=121824"&gt;new five-type index&lt;/a&gt;, developed by federal researchers with the National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER COVID Initiative, identified the most common symptoms in 14,000 people with long COVID, with data from an additional 4000 people added to the updated 2024 index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the index, physicians and researchers can better understand the condition, which is difficult to treat and diagnose because no standard definitions or therapies have been developed. Doctors can use the index to offer more targeted care and help patients manage their symptoms more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index may also help researchers find more treatments for long COVID. Because long COVID can affect so many different parts of the body, it will take time to fully understand how to treat it, but studies like this are making progress in the right direction, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new index uses an updated point system, where points are allotted to each symptom in a list of the 44 most reported symptoms in people with likely long COVID based on how often they occur. Among people in the study with prior COVID infection, 2213 (18%) met the threshold for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 44 most common symptoms were then distributed among five subtypes, with each representing a difference in impact on quality of life and overall health. The most common symptoms were fatigue (85.8%), postexertional malaise (87.4%), and postexertional soreness (75.0%) — where persistent fatigue and discomfort occur after physical or mental exertion — dizziness (65.8%), brain fog (63.8%), gastrointestinal symptoms (59.3%), and palpitations (58%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with prior COVID infection, symptoms were more prevalent in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those grouped into subtype 1 did not report a high incidence of impact on quality of life, physical health, or daily function. Only 21% of people in subtype 1 reported a “poor or fair quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change in smell or taste — usually a symptom that’s bothersome but doesn’t seriously impact overall health — was most present in subtype 1, with 100% of people in subtype 1 reporting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other symptoms in over 50% of people with subtype 1— which were 490 of the 2213 with prior COVID infection — were fatigue (66%), postexertional malaise (53%), and postexertional soreness (55%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these two symptoms can certainly impact quality of life, they became much more prevalent in other subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of possibly debilitating symptoms like postexertional malaise (94%), fatigue (81%), and chronic cough (100%) rose dramatically in people grouped into subtype 2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, 25% of people in subtype 2 reported a “poor or fair quality of life. Postexertional malaise, I think, is probably one of the most debilitating of the symptoms. When somebody comes in and tells me that they’re tired and I think they might have long COVID, the first thing I try to do is see if it is postexertional malaise vs just postinfectious fatigue,” said Lisa Sanders, MD, medical director of Yale’s &lt;a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2023/11/08/a-different-spirit-of-research-yale-clinic-seeks-to-unravel-the-mystery-of-long-covid/"&gt;Long Covid Multidisciplinary Care Center&lt;/a&gt; in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postinfectious fatigue usually resolves much more quickly than postexertional malaise. The latter accounts for several symptoms as also associated with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS is a chronic illness that causes severe fatigue and makes it difficult for sufferers to perform routine, daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Postexertional malaise is an additive symptom of ME/CFS, and that can take a long time to resolve,” Sanders added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similarity between these two symptoms highlights the importance that physicians must place in scrutinizing symptoms to a high degree when they suspect a patient of having long COVID, experts said. By doing so, clinicians can unveil the mask of overlapping symptoms between long COVID symptoms and symptoms of other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 37% of people grouped in subtype 3 reported a poor or fair quality of life, a significant rise from subtypes 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue symptoms were reported by 92%, whereas 82% reported postexertional soreness, and 70% reported dizziness. Additionally, 100% of people in subtype 3 reported brain fog as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders said these symptoms are also common in people with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This condition results from a reduced volume of blood returning to the heart after standing up, which leads to an abnormally fast heart rate. Palpitations and fainting can then occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/how-to-manage-long-covid-brain-fog"&gt;Brain fog can be especially debilitating&lt;/a&gt; in people who are used to multitasking. With brain fog, people accustomed to easily alternating between tasks or doing multiple tasks at once can only do one thing at a time. This can cause stress and an overload of thoughts, even precipitating a change in careers if severe enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though brain fog tends to resolve within 6-9 months after infection, it can last up to 18 months or more. Experts say doctors should always be on the lookout if a patient complains they have trouble concentrating or multitasking in the months after a COVID infection. A neurological exam and cognitive testing can identify abnormalities in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 40% of people in the study grouped into subtype 4 reported a poor or fair quality of life, a modest increase from those with subtype 3. About 65% reported symptoms of brain fog and 92% reported palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizziness was also prevalent at 71%, whereas 60% reported gastrointestinal issues, and 36% said they experienced fever, sweats, and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 700 of the 2213 people fell into this subtype group, by far the highest number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 66% of people in subtype 5 reported a poor to fair quality of life. These people usually reported multisystem symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of prevalence rises across the spectrum of 44 common long COVID symptoms, 99% reported shortness of breath; 98%, postexertional soreness; 94%, dizziness; 92%, postexertional malaise; 80%, GI problems; 78%, weakness; and 69%, chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of Hispanic and multiracial participants were classified as having subtype 5. Also, according to the study, “higher proportions of unvaccinated participants and those with SARS-CoV-2 infection before circulation of the Omicron variant were in subtype 5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests the severity of the Delta variant of COVID-19 be linked to some of the worst long COVID symptoms, but further study would have to be done to conclusively determine may be just a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Do Symptoms Resolve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Sanders, around 17 million Americans are thought to have long COVID. Although 90%-100% of people typically recover within 3 years, that still leaves possibly around 5% of those who don’t recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What people usually say is, ‘I got COVID, and I never quite recovered,” Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five percent of 17 million turns out to be a lot. It’s a lot of suffering,” she added. “I would say that the most common symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, anosmia or dysgeusia, and sleep disorders,” as evidenced by the high percentage of people in certain subtypes of the study reporting a poor quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNd1lBSVRSQ0ZpMkdMZ0wtRk9WdnJXdHNsX295VTJyRmlYWG9GXy1uREtOTEJuZDU4dWdYaTZEM2o4OEJvT0V5Q1d4ejR3d0I3cV92OGFPUTZlNlQxQVpCeWxvY1pEUGEyRHMwRnY2TzBTZEVEZnpuekUzc18wV2VCWm9ZanV0cU1JRXVQdXRCaTJ2MlZBeDZGUVBaSW11RFJOeV9Hc0tR</guid></item><item><title>Why Your Dentist May Be Able To Identify A New Alzheimer's Warning Sign - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPNXNvVmFsV1FnbUwyNFB4OC1iSW5KbnRqTjVoTVF6VnVMY29yREtkYnNRcVZ0aFk4UUxUSEh6VmhrVEVSY3VjaWdHX2YxeC1tUFNEM1cxeHdERXZyRzJsQUN3YzVWeGpIdjZEUTRVRVFSa0RrdmNKOUpQNGNWV0hwZWJJSVZPS3k2Nmt2Nm8zTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-tey52c et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Just like your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44075613/how-to-improve-gut-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44075613/how-to-improve-gut-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gut" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a63182875/vaginal-microbiome-menopause-sex/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a63182875/vaginal-microbiome-menopause-sex/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reproductive organs" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;reproductive organs&lt;/a&gt;, your mouth has its very own microbiome that plays a role in your health and wellness.

Here’s the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Bramen, PhD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mark S.

The participants were broken into two groups: One group had no detectable decline in brain function, while the others had mild cognitive impairment, a condition where people have more memory or thinking problems than others their age. People with mild cognitive impairment are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute on Aging" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The study participants provided the scientists with mouth rinse samples, which were then analyzed, allowing the researchers to break down the bacteria contained in each sample. The researchers discovered that certain bacteria found in the participants’ mouths were linked with having better memory and attention; Others were associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-atzu3h emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which bacteria are associated with memory and attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This study found that people who had large amounts of the bacteria Neisseria and Haemophilus had better memory and attention.

The bacteria Prevotella (also commonly found in peridontel disease) was also associated with people having the gene APOE4, which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-mouth-bacteria-impact-brain-health" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does mouth bacteria impact brain health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/large-study-links-gum-disease-dementia" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/large-study-links-gum-disease-dementia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="several" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36404545/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36404545/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12172" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12172" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="linked" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; bacteria in the mouth to dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/april/gum-bacteria-alzheimers.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/april/gum-bacteria-alzheimers.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has generally suggested that having higher levels of harmful bacteria in the mouth may raise the risk of bodily inflammation, which could potentially &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; raise the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers in this study theorized that harmful bacteria could get into the bloodstream and damage the brain, raising the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They also suggest that a bacterial imbalance could impact how much nitric oxide is formed from nitrate, a compound in vegetables. Nitric oxide is important for memory and communication in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But it’s hard to say for sure that the bacteria causes dementia or issues with brain health, says &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mark S.

Did one cause the other or did they just both occur because we weren't taking good care of our mouth while we were developing the Alzheimer's disease?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-i-make-sure-to-have-the-good-bacteria-in-my-mouth" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I make sure to have the “good bacteria” in my mouth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Eating a plant-based diet seems to be a good start, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Bramen, PhD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Adding nitrate-rich foods like veggies into your diet “can benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes,” she says. This may also help to suppress bacteria that’s linked with dementia, Bramen explains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Again, it’s hard to say at this point that these bacteria cause Alzheimer’s disease, they're just linked.

However, how we age can look very different depending on how we care for ourselves along the way. After all, healthy aging isn’t just about adding more years to your life. It’s about making those years vibrant, active and fulfilling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Healthy aging is the process of maintaining optimal physical, mental and social health and well-being as you age,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition. “It not only relates to living a longer life, but enjoying a higher quality of life where you are able to remain active, cognitively strong and continue to do the things you love.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One important piece of the healthy-aging puzzle is ensuring your body gets the nutrients it needs to stay strong and resilient. While a balanced diet is the foundation, many dietitians agree that the right supplements can play a key role in supporting longevity and overall well-being. Here are their top picks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-urolithin-a"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Urolithin A &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One exciting supplement gaining attention in the world of healthy aging is urolithin A. This compound is naturally produced by certain gut bacteria when we consume foods like pomegranates, strawberries, almonds and walnuts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, not everyone’s body produces it efficiently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Urolithin A may support longevity through its role in enhancing mitochondrial function, the powerhouses of our cells that support energy and health at the cellular level,” says Mitri. “Keeping our mitochondria in optimal shape can promote healthy aging by supporting our cells’ natural detoxification process, enabling the body to rid itself of damaged cells that can accelerate aging.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Urolithin A may also help protect against age-related muscle loss. For instance, one study found that middle-aged adults who took 500 to 1,000 milligrams of urolithin A daily for four months experienced a 10% increase in hamstring strength (or more, in some cases).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As promising as this is, research on urolithin A is relatively new. So, more study is needed before we can say if it’s really an anti-aging game-changer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-coenzyme-q10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Coenzyme Q10 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coenzyme Q10 (or CoQ10) is an antioxidant that plays a vital role in supporting healthy aging. How so? “CoQ10 plays a key role in mitochondrial function,” says &lt;a href="https://thehormonedietitian.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Groves Azzaro, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of The Hormone Dietitian. “We produce this antioxidant in our bodies, but production declines as we age.” In fact, research has found that our body’s production of CoQ10 starts to slow down as early as age 20.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the upside, supporting our mitochondria with antioxidants like CoQ10 may help ensure steady energy levels as we age, says Azzaro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-magnesium-glycinate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Magnesium Glycinate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium glycinate is a supplement that combines the element magnesium with the amino acid glycine. This combination is believed to make its magnesium more easily absorbed by the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to supporting energy levels and keeping inflammation in check, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; may promote better sleep, something that lots of us struggle with as we age. Sounder sleep doesn’t just make you feel rested. It’s also crucial for cellular repair.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How does magnesium help you get more shut-eye? “Magnesium helps regulate the production of melatonin, the hormone that controls your sleep-wake cycle,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a Florida-based registered dietitian and nutrition communications consultant.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Encouraging as this is, there aren’t any studies yet that actually prove that magnesium glycinate will help you sleep better. However, plenty of people swear by it. So, if getting your beauty rest helps you look younger, it might be worth a try.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-omega-3-fatty-acids"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Omega-3 Fatty Acids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, particularly DHA and EPA, play a vital role in brain and heart health,” says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Eat Your Vitamins&lt;/em&gt;. “They reduce inflammation, improve cardiovascular function, and may even protect against cognitive decline, making them a great option for supporting healthy aging.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These hard-to-get fats are found in large quantities in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring. However, few of us eat enough fish to provide enough of these healthy fats. Enter supplements. One promising study found that volunteers who took a daily supplement containing either 1.25 grams or 2.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids for four months were less prone to measures of aging, such as inflammation and stress, than those who took a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for maintaining bone health and preventing osteoporosis, especially as we age,” says Davis. It also keeps your immune and nervous systems strong and healthy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research reveals that this vitamin also supports brain health by protecting brain cells from oxidative stress, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive decline as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Considering that many people don’t get enough sunlight or consume sufficient vitamin D–rich foods, taking a supplement can be an easy and effective way to ensure your body gets enough to stay healthy and youthful.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Balanced Diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats, provides your body with nutrients that support graceful aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also, don’t forget to stay hydrated. Your skin will thank you! &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active.&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity, such as walking, swimming or yoga, keeps your muscles strong and joints flexible and boosts energy levels. Exercise also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and improving mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; Quality sleep is crucial for the body to recharge and repair itself. Aim for seven to nine hours of restful sleep each night to maintain your physical and cognitive health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster Social Connections.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a strong support system promotes emotional well-being and reduces feelings of isolation. Keep in touch with friends and family or join new social groups to keep your mind active and engaged. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Stress Management.&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can negatively impact both mental and physical health, so taking time to relax is essential. Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, are great ways to reduce stress. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aging is an inevitable part of life. But with the right mindset and habits, it can be a fulfilling and empowering experience. “While some factors may be out of our control when it comes to aging, eating a nutrient-dense, high-antioxidant diet and engaging in weight-bearing exercise to protect muscles and bones may help keep us stay healthy and active as we age,” says Azzaro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you could use a little extra help, supplements like urolithin A, CoQ10, magnesium glycinate, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may offer additional support. However, these are only one piece of the anti-aging puzzle and are not a magic bullet. If you choose to use these—or any supplements—consult your health care provider to make sure they are a good fit for your unique health needs.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have some news to share with all of you this morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have been together for a long time and I have shared a lot with you over the years. Unfortunately ,I have some difficult news to tell you about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I recently found out that I have prostate cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luckily, we found it early and it is curable. But I need to attend to it and get better so I can be back to where I belong with my “GO!” team and all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will be out for a period of time recovering -- hopefully quickly -- and when I get back, I plan to share my journey with all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, I will be excited to get back to normal and get back to the routine as soon as I can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tough to share, but it is what it is. And I’ll be back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave also had this message for 3News' Danita Harris and Matt Wintz:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I appreciate you guys more than you know," he told them. "I appreciate everything you’ve done so far through the journey. I’ll be thinking about you, and I’ll be updating everyone as we go along, but I will be back. This is where I love to be.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danita told Dave the "GO!" family "will be with you every step of the way."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We love you and care about you," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt added: "Not only do we have your back, we have you through prayer, which is a powerful thing that can get stuff done around here. We’ll support you every step."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Chan School of Public Health in Boston and others based in Chicago, Perth and Copenhagen, set out to discover if a flavonoid-rich diet impacted measures of healthy ageing, notably frailty levels, physical function and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;To do that, scientists examined data from two large studies, the Nurses’ Health Study (1990–2014) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (2006-2018), which followed 62,743 females and 23,687 males, all aged 60 or over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Ageing, on a biological level, is the result of an accumulation of damage to cells and tissues that leads to a gradual decline in physical and mental capacities, increased susceptibility to diseases and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Although life expectancy has been increasing in many developed countries including Ireland – where male life expectancy, as measured in 2021, now stands at 80.5 years for men and 84.3 years for women – the proportion of years people can expect to stay in good health has not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Scientists are keen to establish the factors that determine healthy ageing so that people can aim to increase the number of years where they are free of illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;The study participants with the highest ‘flavodiet’ scores – who had higher intakes of red wine, tea, apples, blueberries and oranges – were found to have lower risk of age-related poor health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;The scientists compared those with highest flavodiet scores to those with the lowest. The former group were found to benefit across all three measures of healthy ageing. They had a 15 per cent lower risk of frailty, a 12 per cent lower risk of impaired physical function and a 12 per cent lower risk of poor mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;This study adds to growing evidence that flavonoids improve heart health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“Studies suggest they reduce inflammation, improve our lipid and blood pressure levels, improve blood vessel function, improve glucose control and have neuroprotective effects,” said Prof Cassidy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Irish Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:53:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxNWVBRMmZIWmNUNmhHdVVEb1g4Ykw1NnhsUllVY1ZQdTJuZU5mQUN0QWZiY2ZQclJORmx5VXYwcDV2MTE2TUJDWkV4X0ZOXzI5dWo1dlM2Z1BVMWdzckd6ZHcxbEo4TnJBQk5uc1d5R0VzcVFudXVWYlVVQ0hwOXBDeGc1cjlMOVdPbnhDazI5SlV3ZWpPblZFaDJhVVRrM0NRTjZHTnNZbUNXTDlONFRva2JSY2ZZT28xWTdtME5XcjhNR3R0bEZHc0lBTkdzTk5RbVFsQ0xhek5GZDBYSGc</guid></item><item><title>26 Photos Of The Wildest And Dumbest Things Moms Have Actually Posted In Online Mom Groups - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9ZMjBlTlpMeGg1aEF6cUhTZXpzdHlaUDBua2VPVW84c2F3Wl9pRTRJRHN4bElZTWNibXhDT29nS08zQnYtc04zeFE1N0tIMlJQWWVCdlRPMXE0SlY3c2xZZlFfVEFKdGgw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="headline_container__AwL7p  embed-headline"&gt;&lt;h1 class="headline_title__NbsAE embed-headline-title"&gt;26 Photos Of The Wildest And Dumbest Things Moms Have Actually Posted In Online Mom Groups &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="headline_description__xYhEI embed-headline-description"&gt;"OMG, I would rather let my baby eat dog food off the floor (which he's done a few times) than use soap on him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BuzzFeed</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:31:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9ZMjBlTlpMeGg1aEF6cUhTZXpzdHlaUDBua2VPVW84c2F3Wl9pRTRJRHN4bElZTWNibXhDT29nS08zQnYtc04zeFE1N0tIMlJQWWVCdlRPMXE0SlY3c2xZZlFfVEFKdGgw</guid></item><item><title>Mysterious brain activity in dying patients sparks debate over consciousness and the soul - Dimsum Daily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxONnc4cXhhT2pBY25xdXN3ZHBGUjBMUDVnTHpNTUxGLWpLUlNXWkpiZHd1dkMyNHZtMzFyM0V4ZWhRNnJIajZjWWdScnRWa3RnOXNCMnFER3UydWxULXBTcWJBMGZFUzR6c2hYbk56YTRfT0pMN0FpZG5RclpUb3VMeGRDYXhJal9UeDA1MFViTVl2UF9oSTA4dWxQM3ozTmxxalEzc3ZUYXVBVHc2WDJZVU5ZQTY0U2JQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content tagdiv-type"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;20th February 2025 – (Arizona) A recent study monitoring the brain activity of a clinically dead patient has revealed a mysterious burst of energy, reigniting debates over the nature of consciousness and the possibility of the soul leaving the body after death. Dr. Stuart Hameroff, an anaesthesiologist and professor at the University of Arizona, described the phenomenon as a sudden spike in gamma synchrony—a brain wave pattern associated with awareness and perception—detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“They saw everything go away, and then [psh], you got this activity when there was no blood pressure, no heart rate,” Dr. Hameroff explained in an interview with Project Unity. “So that could be the near-death experience, or it could be the soul leaving the body, perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The activity, which lasted between 30 to 90 seconds, occurred after the patient was declared clinically dead. While sceptics argue it could be the “last gasp” of neurons firing or an illusion, Dr. Hameroff suggests it may indicate consciousness persisting at a deeper, low-energy level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings echo earlier research by Dr. Lakhmir Chawla, who pioneered EEG monitoring of brain-dead patients to ensure no brain activity before organ donation. Dr. Hameroff noted that such bursts of activity are reproducible, occurring in about 50% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hameroff also referenced a study by Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, where volunteers given psilocybin reported vivid hallucinations despite showing minimal brain activity on MRI scans. This, he speculates, could point to consciousness operating at a quantum level within neurons—a theory that challenges traditional neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think consciousness is actually low energy,” Dr. Hameroff concluded, suggesting it may be “the last thing to go” during the dying process.&lt;/p&gt;

Fever, along with coughing and sore throat, is one of the main features of the flu, and yet this common symptom is surrounded by myths. “It’s definitely a time of year when we hear more of these myths,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. David Cutler;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist in family medicine at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. “Not a week goes by that I’m not answering or clearing up questions about what a fever is, what to do about it or what having a fever means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These are the biggest myths about fevers that doctors say they’d like to set straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no1-a-normal-body-temperature-is-986-degrees"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 1: Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Technically, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/average-body-temperature-no-longer-163811445.html" data-ylk="slk:that’s not true;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;that’s not true&lt;/a&gt;, although there is plenty of confusion about this. “There is a complex discussion about what is a normal body temperature,” Cutler says. While most people think of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit as being the baseline for everyone, that number was &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/400116" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:established decades;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;established decades&lt;/a&gt; ago by a German physician who took millions of temperatures to come up with an average. But more recent research suggests that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2809098" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:people can have various temperatures;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;people can have various temperatures&lt;/a&gt; when they’re healthy — and that 97.9 might be a more accurate average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, the medical community recognizes a fever as any temperature at or above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/henry-young-md-137421" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Henry Young;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Henry Young&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life. But if you have a normal body temperature that tends to be lower than 98.6, you may have feverish symptoms below 100.4, Cutler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no2-feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 2: Feed a cold, starve a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever but feel like eating, Young says it’s important to continue to fuel your body. “‘Starving’ a fever can be dangerous as, when you are ill, your body requires calories to continue to function and to fight the infection,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, it’s OK if you aren’t very hungry when you have a fever, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. William Schaffner,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “The important thing is to keep up your fluids,” he says. “You can lose body fluids by sweating when you have a fever, and you may not even realize that you’re sweating.” He suggests focusing on water, sports drinks and fruit juices, and avoiding drinks with alcohol and caffeine, which can cause you to lose more fluid than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no3-fevers-are-inherently-dangerous"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 3: Fevers are inherently dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a fever isn’t fun, but it’s evidence that your body is doing the right thing. “Fever is a sign that your body is working to fight an infection and can be a good sign that your immune system is working,” Young says. “Fevers can slow the growth of a virus or bacteria in our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most fevers are not inherently dangerous, Schaffner says. The exception is when temperatures spike to extremely high numbers, like 105 or 106 degrees, he says. “Then, indeed, you can have problems,” and seeking medical attention is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no4-fever-reducing-medications-will-help-you-get-better"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 4: Fever-reducing medications will help you get better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking an over-the-counter medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help you feel better in the moment. “But it is not going to actually kill the virus or bacteria causing the infection,” Young says. Instead, these medications can be helpful in treating the symptoms linked with a fever like body aches, chills, sweats and fatigue, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These medications can help you to feel more comfortable while you ride it out,” Schaffner explains. “If the fever is caused by something like an influenza infection, those medications won’t do anything for the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no5-you-need-to-call-a-doctor-every-time-you-have-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 5: You need to call a doctor every time you have a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not necessarily. If you feel uncomfortable but are able to get your symptoms under control with the help of fever-reducing medications, Schaffner says, there’s no need to call a doctor. But if your fever lingers for several days, makes you feel debilitated or confused or you have no idea what could be causing your lingering fever, it’s time to be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also necessary to contact a health care provider sooner if the patient is in a vulnerable group. “For some individuals, fevers can be more serious than for others — particularly the very young, the very old or individuals with a weakened immune system,” Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no6-no-touch-thermometers-are-as-accurate-as-gold-standard-oral-ones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 6: No-touch thermometers are as accurate as gold-standard oral ones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No-touch thermometers have been around for years, but they became massively popular during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While these thermometers can tell your temperature, research suggests they’re &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11046542/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generally not as good;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;generally not as good&lt;/a&gt; at giving an &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99300-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:accurate reading;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;accurate reading&lt;/a&gt; as oral thermometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That doesn’t mean you can’t use one of these though. “The no-touch thermometers are appealing because they can be faster and allow a greater distance between the sick individual and the person collecting the temperature,” Young says. They’re also easier to use with young children, who tend to reject putting a thermometer in their mouth, he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The key thing is that you have to &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/media/pdfs/2024/05/How-to-Use-an-Infrared-Thermometer-ENGLISH-508.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:use them correctly;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;use them correctly&lt;/a&gt;,” Schaffner says. (That means following the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.)

If you have a lower fever and you feel generally OK, Schaffner says you don’t need to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if you have a fever and feel lousy, taking an over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help you feel better and even bring the fever down, he says. Still, Young says that fevers won’t necessarily continue to go up if you don’t treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever, Schaffner recommends doing your best to stay well hydrated. “Try to rest and be alert to see whatever else is happening in your body,” he says. “If someone else is going on, that’s a signal to seek medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:00:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNanNlTUxHOTVoR01YY0dMZHpta25JcTBsYm9kQU53TkxjdGFPazN0Z2xLemdBY3BUclVEeDhiN2RFaUN0djMzSUNhaE1lamZUdHBvYmFId2Nram5NWlNLQVVFcGo0YjBoVF9zLVREM1ZMT3MydFl3cjB2WHJ6X2tzdkdFU2xEQzg0eHBPdldlcS14OWhzU0tPWEgwMlBnYUdheTdYNw</guid></item><item><title>Doctors set the record straight on 7 common fever myths - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbzdFVHVYX1E0cmlsSVkxX1pMdldSUG44LU9Xd01QOFdDTm5vSDZNcEJYeFFxcFR0d0trSERRNUNkcmFfdDRQVzFzRFVuSEZjdUkyUWpvR3dSOG8xVlJQbE93cEhlNllZV3lqQW16OXE3a1BsdkU0bjBpeHNXM3p6d3ln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/flu-levels-are-the-highest-theyve-been-since-2009-the-cdc-says-the-latest-on-winter-illnesses-including-rsv-covid-19-and-more-152406954.html" data-ylk="slk:a lot of flu cases;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a lot of flu cases&lt;/a&gt; right now — at least &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/worst-flu-season-influenza-virus-spread-new-bird-flu-cases-us-plus#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20latest%20CDC,the%202009%2D2010%20flu%20season." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:29 million;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;29 million&lt;/a&gt; so far this season, making this the worst flu season the U.S. has seen in nearly a decade, according to data from the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Fever, along with coughing and sore throat, is one of the main features of the flu, and yet this common symptom is surrounded by myths. “It’s definitely a time of year when we hear more of these myths,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. David Cutler;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist in family medicine at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. “Not a week goes by that I’m not answering or clearing up questions about what a fever is, what to do about it or what having a fever means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These are the biggest myths about fevers that doctors say they’d like to set straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no1-a-normal-body-temperature-is-986-degrees"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 1: Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Technically, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/average-body-temperature-no-longer-163811445.html" data-ylk="slk:that’s not true;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;that’s not true&lt;/a&gt;, although there is plenty of confusion about this. “There is a complex discussion about what is a normal body temperature,” Cutler says. While most people think of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit as being the baseline for everyone, that number was &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/400116" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:established decades;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;established decades&lt;/a&gt; ago by a German physician who took millions of temperatures to come up with an average. But more recent research suggests that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2809098" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:people can have various temperatures;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;people can have various temperatures&lt;/a&gt; when they’re healthy — and that 97.9 might be a more accurate average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, the medical community recognizes a fever as any temperature at or above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/henry-young-md-137421" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Henry Young;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Henry Young&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life. But if you have a normal body temperature that tends to be lower than 98.6, you may have feverish symptoms below 100.4, Cutler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no2-feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 2: Feed a cold, starve a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever but feel like eating, Young says it’s important to continue to fuel your body. “‘Starving’ a fever can be dangerous as, when you are ill, your body requires calories to continue to function and to fight the infection,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, it’s OK if you aren’t very hungry when you have a fever, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. William Schaffner,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “The important thing is to keep up your fluids,” he says. “You can lose body fluids by sweating when you have a fever, and you may not even realize that you’re sweating.” He suggests focusing on water, sports drinks and fruit juices, and avoiding drinks with alcohol and caffeine, which can cause you to lose more fluid than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no3-fevers-are-inherently-dangerous"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 3: Fevers are inherently dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a fever isn’t fun, but it’s evidence that your body is doing the right thing. “Fever is a sign that your body is working to fight an infection and can be a good sign that your immune system is working,” Young says. “Fevers can slow the growth of a virus or bacteria in our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most fevers are not inherently dangerous, Schaffner says. The exception is when temperatures spike to extremely high numbers, like 105 or 106 degrees, he says. “Then, indeed, you can have problems,” and seeking medical attention is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no4-fever-reducing-medications-will-help-you-get-better"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 4: Fever-reducing medications will help you get better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking an over-the-counter medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help you feel better in the moment. “But it is not going to actually kill the virus or bacteria causing the infection,” Young says. Instead, these medications can be helpful in treating the symptoms linked with a fever like body aches, chills, sweats and fatigue, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These medications can help you to feel more comfortable while you ride it out,” Schaffner explains. “If the fever is caused by something like an influenza infection, those medications won’t do anything for the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no5-you-need-to-call-a-doctor-every-time-you-have-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 5: You need to call a doctor every time you have a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not necessarily. If you feel uncomfortable but are able to get your symptoms under control with the help of fever-reducing medications, Schaffner says, there’s no need to call a doctor. But if your fever lingers for several days, makes you feel debilitated or confused or you have no idea what could be causing your lingering fever, it’s time to be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also necessary to contact a health care provider sooner if the patient is in a vulnerable group. “For some individuals, fevers can be more serious than for others — particularly the very young, the very old or individuals with a weakened immune system,” Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no6-no-touch-thermometers-are-as-accurate-as-gold-standard-oral-ones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 6: No-touch thermometers are as accurate as gold-standard oral ones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No-touch thermometers have been around for years, but they became massively popular during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While these thermometers can tell your temperature, research suggests they’re &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11046542/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generally not as good;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;generally not as good&lt;/a&gt; at giving an &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99300-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:accurate reading;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;accurate reading&lt;/a&gt; as oral thermometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That doesn’t mean you can’t use one of these though. “The no-touch thermometers are appealing because they can be faster and allow a greater distance between the sick individual and the person collecting the temperature,” Young says. They’re also easier to use with young children, who tend to reject putting a thermometer in their mouth, he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The key thing is that you have to &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/media/pdfs/2024/05/How-to-Use-an-Infrared-Thermometer-ENGLISH-508.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:use them correctly;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;use them correctly&lt;/a&gt;,” Schaffner says. (That means following the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.) Schaffner suggests getting a few readings with a no-touch thermometer to see how consistent they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no7-all-fevers-need-to-be-treated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 7: All fevers need to be treated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A fever is a sign that your body is fighting off an infection, Schaffner says. “But there’s a distinction between the cause of the fever and the fever itself,” he says.

It’s a cruel irony, then, that many of us who make it that far will begin to lose our sense of who we are due to dementia. If you’re 65, you’ve got about a one in 20 chance of developing the most common form, Alzheimer’s disease, in the next decade. At 75, it’s about one in seven, while those fortunate enough to reach 85 face a one in three chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Given the toll this illness takes on sufferers and those around them, hundreds of millions of families around the world are desperate for a medical breakthrough – and for years, headlines have suggested that it might be imminent.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The subtitle of Doctored – Fraud, Arrogance and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s &lt;em&gt;– &lt;/em&gt;serves as a spoiler as to how that story ends, at least for the moment. The fraud uncovered by a rag-tag group of researchers into academic integrity and extensively documented here by Charles Piller, an investigative journalist for the magazine Science, feels like the kind of scandal that should have had wall-to-wall coverage. And yet, outside scientific circles, it remains relatively low-profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The story is complicated, but a summary might go like this: for decades, something called the amyloid hypothesis has dominated research into Alzheimer’s, determining how billions of dollars of public and private funding into new drugs was spent. The brains of people who had died with it showed clumps of sticky protein – called amyloid plaques – between neurons. It seemed logical that these might be responsible for the disease’s symptoms. And while this became the main line of inquiry, it never quite delivered on its early promise. Many people with amyloid plaques didn’t have signs of Alzheimer’s, for example. Something seemed to be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;And then came what seemed like decisive proof: a 2006 paper from the University of Minnesota, which went on to become one of the most cited in the field, showed that a sub-type of amyloid led to memory impairment. It wasn’t until 2022 that scientific sleuths &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/23/alzheimers-study-fraudulent" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that key images on which the research relied might have been Photoshopped to better fit the hypothesis. At first, the scientists fought back against the claims, but the 2006 paper has now been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt;, as have others based around the same findings. As the book explains, investigations continue and several key figures involved deny any knowledge of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than read&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The implication is that years of work and billions of dollars spent on Alzheimer’s research may have been carried out on the basis of fraudulent evidence. The scale of the harm caused and damage done is likely to be incalculable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Piller handles the difficult material patiently and meticulously, as you would expect of an experienced specialist reporter. As the book continues, it becomes an ever more uncomfortable read: the tale starts with the alleged fakery of images by one, or a handful, of scientists. By the end, we’re left wondering if any research can really be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than it is to read. Piller tries to humanise his narrative with pen portraits of key figures, but his habit of doing several of these in a row – and formulaically telling us everyone’s place of birth and what their parents and grandparents did – gets repetitive and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

								&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matt Teegarden likes to compare apples to &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/apples"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt;. Or, at the very least, he wants studies on &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/01/should-we-be-afraid-of-ultra-processed-foods-its-complicated/"&gt;ultra-processed foods &lt;/a&gt;to compare apples to applesauce—not just apples to orange juice. That distinction, he argued in a Wednesday seminar hosted by the &lt;a href="https://www.ift.org/"&gt;Institute of Food Technologists&lt;/a&gt;, is crucial in parsing the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/nutrition"&gt;nutritional &lt;/a&gt;complexity of modern food processing. As it stands, many of the most-cited studies on the topic conflate categories in ways that obscure rather than illuminate the role of processing in nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation around ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has accelerated in recent years, with public health advocates and consumers alike turning to the NOVA classification system to decode the complexities of modern food production. But Teegarden, a food scientist and chemist, alongside Dr. Susanne Bügel, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, suggests that the system is oversimplified, failing to account for the nuances of nutrition, formulation and processing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NOVA system — &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which was developed in the early 2000s by researchers at the University of São Paulo, led by Brazilian nutritionist Carlos Monteiro — classifies foods into four categories: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like fresh fruit and vegetables; processed culinary ingredients, like &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/19/youre-using-olive-oil-the-way-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;oils&lt;/a&gt; and sugars; processed foods, such as canned vegetables or tinned fish; and ultra-processed foods, which include packaged snacks, sodas and flavored yogurts. The issue, Teegarden pointed out, is that the system treats vastly different foods as nutritionally equivalent simply because they undergo a similar level of processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loaf of whole wheat bread, for instance, can be classified as either a category 2 or a category 4 food, depending on the production method. The same goes for yogurt and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/01/23/youre-only-3-ingredients-and-10-minutes-away-from-the-herbiest-bean-soup-ever/"&gt;canned beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If beans are just canned in water and a little bit of salt, that would be group three,” Teerfarden said. “But if maybe they have EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] added for color retention, that would be seen as a cosmetic additive, and they would be group four, even though they're virtually the same product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bügel is leading an initiative aimed at refining this approach. Her team is working on a classification system that integrates processing methods with nutritional content, providing a more holistic view of a food’s health impact. She points out that foods like mass-produced packaged breads, breakfast &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/07/revisiting-millsberry-the-wild-rise-and-fall-of-general-mills-virtual-cereal-themed-town/"&gt;cereals&lt;/a&gt; and fruit yogurts are classified as ultra-processed under the NOVA system, yet despite this classification, these products still offer significant nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very difficult to use [the NOVA system], both for the professionals and for the consumers,” she said. “For the professionals, we have to guess whether people are eating bread bought in a supermarket or bread bought in a bakery. It’s absolutely not based on scientific evidence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oversimplifications of the NOVA system become even more apparent when examining epidemiological studies linking UPFs to negative health outcomes. Many rely on dietary recall data, a notoriously unreliable metric, and don’t necessarily track food consumption with processing levels in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Importantly with NOVA, the data that’s been collected in a lot of the studies that have been published thus far, the data is not necessarily collected with processing in mind,” Teergarden said. “In fact, a lot of the data was collected before NOVA was even invented. We have a lot of historical data here. So the processing levels of the foods in these dietary surveys are actually implied.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That imprecision, coupled with the broad category definitions, has led to some dubious findings. One study, Teegarden pointed out, found a correlation between UPF consumption and accidental death — a statistical oddity that likely indicates residual confounding rather than causation. “So be careful if you’re eating a &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/candy"&gt;candy bar &lt;/a&gt;and walking under an air conditioning unit,” he joked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies, while more rigorous, still struggle with the challenge of isolating processing as an independent health factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the gold standard for nutritional research is the randomized controlled trial, which allows scientists to isolate specific dietary variables. Only a handful of such studies exist on UPFs, but they do suggest that ultra-processed diets may encourage overeating. However, Teegarden argues that even these studies lack crucial nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My issue here as a food scientist is that we're not testing whether or not making something ultra-processed is causing these effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, a recent study conducted in Japan. On the first day, participants assigned to the ultra-processed diet were given fried chicken, biscuits and a giant bowl of sweetened yogurt. Meanwhile, the minimally processed diet featured rice, vegetables and lean protein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My issue here as a food scientist is that we're not testing whether or not making something ultra-processed is causing these effects,” he said. “We're testing these overall dietary patterns. So we're missing the buck a little bit here because we've controlled for nutrient content, but we haven't controlled for food type.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy ignores an inconvenient truth: Some UPFs contribute meaningfully to a balanced diet. Fortified cereals provide essential micronutrients, plant-based milks cater to those with dairy intolerances and some packaged breads offer whole grains that many people wouldn’t otherwise consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal, according to both Teegarden and Bügel, shouldn’t be to demonize processing as a concept, but rather to refine how we assess its impact on health. A smarter classification system — one that accounts for processing, formulation and nutrition — could help public health officials provide more accurate dietary guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, the conversation about ultra-processed foods remains muddied, shaped more by broad-strokes panic than by the scientific precision it deserves. And if we want to truly understand the role of processing in modern diets, we need to move beyond comparing apples to orange juice — and start comparing apples to applesauce.&lt;/p&gt;

"I never thought twice about it," says Hill, now a researcher who teaches evolutionary psychology at Texas Christian University, an institution affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States. It was only when she switched contraceptives, 12 years after starting to take the pill, that an epiphany dawned on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"My life felt brighter and more interesting, like I had walked out of a 2D black-and-white movie into a full-colour, 3D, meaning-filled reality," says Hill. Her experiences of taking oral contraceptives inspired her to study the science involved and publish a book, &lt;i id="how-the-pill-changes-everything" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;How the Pill Changes Everything&lt;/i&gt;, in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In addition to discussing legitimate concerns, social media influencers have been &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66671765" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;spreading misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about the contraceptive pill's side effects, both mental and physical. While they may have no medical background, some are even encouraging women to abandon contraception altogether – a trend which some experts believe could be behind a recent spike in &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnvjl27rrjzo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;abortions in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But can the pill really alter one's personality and outlook on life? Can it contribute to serious mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, or even lead to suicide, in extreme cases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="a-slow-response" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-slow-response" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A slow response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The answer, it appears, isn't clear-cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;When the pill made its debut in the US in 1960, it &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/history-oral-contraception/2000-06#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration,as%20it%20is%20popularly%20known." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;amassed a whopping 1.2 million users&lt;/a&gt; within two years.

First, there's the most popular kind, the combined pill, which contains synthetic versions of oestrogen and progesterone. The other is the progestogen-only pill, or "mini-pill". Both work to prevent pregnancy &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://111.wales.nhs.uk/combinedcontraceptivepill/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;in a handful of ways&lt;/a&gt;, including suppressing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus to make it harder for a sperm to penetrate and reach an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, the hormones in oral contraceptives don't just affect the body, they can also have powerful effects on women's brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp" alt="Dempsey Ewan There’s some evidence that the contraceptive pill can be harmful to women’s mental health – but how exactly this works remains unclear (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Dempsey Ewan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;There’s some evidence that the contraceptive pill can be harmful to women’s mental health – but how exactly this works remains unclear (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"The impact of hormones on the brain is complicated," says Johannes Bitzer, an obstetrician-gynaecologist (OBGYN) and psychotherapist at the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. "For some individuals, the pill has a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39424518/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;positive effect on mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;. In others, it may cause irritation and even anxiety." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Medical warnings, for the most part of the pill's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15984258" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;65-year history&lt;/a&gt;, have been scant. Some sexual health providers in the UK and the US make no mention whatsoever of the mental side effects of the pill on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I think the big issue is that in OBGYN training, mental health is not a subject. It's for the psychiatrists," says Bitzer, who has been in the field for nearly 40 years. Things are slowly changing, but "before, when we discussed the pill, we talked about thrombosis, cancer, irregular bleeding, weight gain, and so on. The issue of mental health was more or less excluded," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There hadn't been much investigation into potential mental side effects from researchers, either. But a shift started taking place in 2016, says Bitzer, when a group from Denmark published a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27680324/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;seminal paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, leading to more research in the years after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In the original Danish study, researchers dug into the country's national health database to track the mental health of over a million women aged between 15 and 34 over a period of 14 years. They discovered that women who started taking the combined pill were 70% more likely to be prescribed antidepressants six months later, as compared to those who had never taken oral contraceptives. For those starting on the mini-pill, the risk was 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In 2023, a separate group of researchers gleaned &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37303201/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;similar results&lt;/a&gt; when they analysed the health records of a quarter of a million women in the UK Biobank, a large repository of genetic and medical information. Pill-users, they found, were 71% more likely to be depressed compared with never-users, two years after beginning their contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"There's a convincing temporal association between starting use of these products and then developing depression symptoms," says Øjvind Lidegaard, a medical epidemiologist specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Copenhagen, who led the Danish study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, both of these studies were "cohort studies", conducted by analysing the data of large groups of women, and comparing the mental health outcomes of those who were taking oral contraceptives with those who weren’t. This means they were able to identify if there was an association between these two things, but not unravel whether there was cause and effect. There could, for example, be some pre-existing differences between the groups of women that affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="conflicting-results" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="conflicting-results" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Conflicting results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Some studies seem to contradict the correlation between certain mental health conditions and oral contraceptive use. For instance, when researchers at Ohio State University &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29496297/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;reviewed 26 earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;, they found only a "minimal" link between progestogen-only methods of contraception and depression. Separately, in two clinical trials, each involving between 200 and 340 women in Sweden, researchers concluded that the combined pill &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28433366/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;didn't lead to depression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923181/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;worsening mood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Intriguingly, taking a "break" from oral contraceptives – as is required for seven days each month with many types of the combined pill – can lead to mood worsening, according to some findings. In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37755829/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 120 pill-taking women in Austria, some of whom were long-term users, participants reported feeling a 7% increase in anxiety during their pill pause, as well as a 13% and 24% rise in negative feelings and mental health symptoms, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"So from a mental health perspective, it might be more beneficial for contraceptive users to go for continuous use," says Belinda Pletzer, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Salzburg, who is leading an EU-funded &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.europeandissemination.eu/becontra/11695" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to study the effect of hormonal contraceptives on the female brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Pletzer doesn't discount the fact that some women do suffer poorly, psychologically speaking, when on the pill, and that these symptoms should be taken seriously. "But it's just a small percentage of women," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;One reason to explain the vast discrepancy in study findings on the mental side-effects of oral contraceptives is quite simply the nature of what's at hand, says Helena Kopp Kallner, an OBGYN at Danderyd Hospital near Stockholm in Sweden. Namely, that mental health conditions are often measured subjectively, and are notoriously difficult to study. Add to that that there are many different pill types (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/combination-birth-control-pills" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;over 30 brands of the combined pill exist&lt;/a&gt;), so often scientists might end up comparing apples to oranges, she says. The different studies also use varying methodologies, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp" alt='Dempsey Ewan One study found that taking the seven day "break" recommended for some contraceptive pills could make women feel worse (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)' class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Dempsey Ewan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;One study found that taking the seven day "break" recommended for some contraceptive pills could make women feel worse (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;What researchers look for at the end of their study also affects their findings, adds Bitzer. In the Danish study, for instance, "the fact that you get prescribed antidepressants is not necessarily related to a diagnosis of depression, but to the practice of the doctor, which makes your outcome measure quite problematic", he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;It's also hard to prove cause-and-effect relationships from such observational studies, says Sofia Zettermark, a physician based in Gothenburg, Sweden, because there could be other factors – such as genetics and one's environment – that may influence the results. For example, when she analysed the health records of nearly a million women in the national Swedish registries, she discovered that women from low-income and immigrant backgrounds &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/10/e049553.long" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;were more sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to experiencing mood changes on hormonal contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Lidegaard, for his part, clarifies that his study must be understood in the wider context. "There's no doubt that some women who start using hormonal contraception experience severe changes in their mental health," says Lidegaard. "However, it's important to realise that it's only 7 to 8% who face so many mental incidences that they are forced to stop taking their medication...The majority of women taking these products don't feel any severe discomfort mentally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;And of course, for some women the benefits of oral contraceptives may outweigh any side-effects. In addition to providing highly effective contraception, the combined and mini-pill can have other positive physical effects. "If you have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/endometriosis/#:~:text=Medicines%20are%20often%20the%20first,these%20can%20help%20ease%20pain" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/effects-on-periods/#:~:text=Methods%20of%20contraception%20that%20can%20help%20with%20heavy%20periods%20are,progestogen%2Donly%20pill" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;heavy bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00774-2/pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;PMDD&lt;/a&gt; [premenstrual dysphoric disorder, an extreme and debilitating form of PMS], then the pill can actually help improve it," says Kopp Kallner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Pregnancy itself can also involve significant health complications, particularly in the developing world. Meanwhile, several studies have found a link between &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9072423/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20several%20studies%20have%20confirmed,during%20the%20course%20of%20pregnancy." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;unplanned pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and a higher risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="altering-brain-chemistry" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="altering-brain-chemistry" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Altering brain chemistry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But where there are impacts on mental health, how exactly does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There are many ways that oral contraceptives might be able to interfere with women's moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Instead, combined and mini-pills, as well as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), contain synthetic versions of these hormones which disrupt the natural progression of the menstrual cycle. This includes progestins, a group of artificial progestogen hormones that can be manufactured in a variety of ways, though the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563211/#:~:text=The%20testosterone%20derivatives%20are%20the,norethindrone%20acetate%2C%20ethynodiol%20diacetate%2C%20norethynodrel" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;majority are made from testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. Neither synthetic oestrogens or progestins are chemically identical to the hormones naturally produced by the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This is thought to have a number of consequences. One is that, in women who are taking the contraceptive pill, pathways involving the neurotransmitter serotonin – which is often described as the brain's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/serotonin-the-natural-mood-booster" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;natural "mood-booster"&lt;/a&gt; – might be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In one study, a group of Danish researchers analysed brain scans of 53 healthy women, 16 of which were taking oral contraceptive pills, to assess the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7586815/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;activity of the serotonin system&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the women using oral contraceptives had 9-12% lower levels of a certain type of serotonin signalling compared to the women who were not taking these drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The effect was twice as large as the impact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are known to have on this particular kind of signalling. The researchers speculated that this might be the mechanism responsible for the link between oral contraceptives and depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There's also some evidence that the artificial oestrogen and progestins present in oral contraceptives might interfere with the production of allopregnanolone, another hormone with crucial roles in the brain – particularly the regulation of mood and the body's stress response. A pharmaceutical version of this hormone was approved in the US in 2019 for the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289519300505" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;treatment of post-natal depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In women who are not taking artificial sex hormones, progesterone can be converted into allopregnanolone. But in women using the contraceptive pill, this process is thought to be disrupted: progestins don't get broken down into allopregnanolone, meaning they may miss out on some of its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In one study conducted in rats, those taking oral contraceptives had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305712001463" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;lower concentrations of allopregnanolone in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.

"What researchers have found is that you get a blunting of the cortisol response to stress that most naturally cycling women experience," explains Hill. "No cortisol equals no stress, which might sound like a good thing on the surface. But that's not how it works – cortisol isn't what causes stress, it's how our body helps cope with and recover from stress." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="adolescent-risk" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="adolescent-risk" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Adolescent risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There's one group in particular that Lidegaard worries about: teenage girls. His study revealed that those aged between 15 and 19 were almost twice as likely (1.8 times) to receive an antidepressant prescription after starting the combined pill compared to those who did not take the pill. For those on the mini-pill, the risk was more than double (this group was 2.2 times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants than those who did not take the pill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Similarly, Zettermark's study found that adolescent girls displayed the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29566064/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;strongest association&lt;/a&gt; between hormonal contraceptives and antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication use. Those aged 12 to 14 were 240% and 190% more likely to be prescribed the drugs within a year of starting the combined pill and mini-pill, respectively; or 52% and 83% if they were between 15 and 17 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In another study, based on the data from 264,557 women invovled with the UK Biobank, researchers found that those who had taken oral contraceptives at some point in their lives had a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/populationbased-cohort-study-of-oral-contraceptive-use-and-risk-of-depression/B3C611DD318D7DC536B4BD439343A5BD" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;higher risk of developing depression&lt;/a&gt; over their lifetime, but the risk was most pronounced during the first two years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Apart from adolescents, there's another group many physicians are wary of prescribing oral contraception to. "If you have been depressed previously, have recurrent depressions, or any psychiatric issues at all, you have an increased risk of feeling depressed on the pill," cautions Kopp Kallner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Experts such as Kopp Kallner say self-awareness is key – you should monitor your mood for a few months when you first start the pill, or switch from one brand to another. If you have concerns about how your contraception is affecting your mood, arrange to speak to your healthcare provider. With so &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/different-progestin-types-906936" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;many different types of progestins&lt;/a&gt;, and combinations of these with artificial oestrogen, not to mention the different doses and preparations, finding the right fit is "a little bit of an art," says Bitzer. "It's very much individualised treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, there are many other types of contraception available that either do not involve hormones or contain lower doses than oral contraceptives, including male and female condoms (which can also help protect against sexually transmitted diseases), the vaginal ring, the IUS (the hormonal coil), the IUD (the copper coil), and sterilisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For Hill, changing the method of contraception she used was life-altering.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; mpox a public health emergency of international concern last August as cases rose in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and spread to neighboring countries in Africa. USAid has been working to contain the virus through vaccination, testing and surveillance efforts on the ground. Last year, USAid and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0822-mpox-outbreak.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contributed&lt;/a&gt; $55m in emergency assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAid&lt;/a&gt; workers with knowledge of the agency’s mpox response said that not all of that money has been disbursed and is now frozen under the administration’s orders to stop nearly all humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In addition to the funding freeze, USAid workers were evacuated from the country at the end of January, according to court filings. Until weeks ago, the United States was a leader in coordinating response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One USAid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said in planning meetings: “Immediately it’s eyes on USAid of, ‘What are you guys going to do?’ And so everybody’s lost right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The aid freeze has meant that some provinces in the country who depend solely on USAid funds have been stripped of any resources to contain the virus, the worker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We were working on creating a sustainable system that can respond not just to the current mpox outbreak but can be used in the future for any other outbreak and now we’re not sure if that will succeed,” said a second USAid worker with knowledge of the mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Just like all these increased cases of Ebola and Marburg in neighboring countries, it’s not if, but when the next one in the DRC will be and how the country is going to be ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cutting off resources to contain the current outbreak only increases the chances of mpox spreading to more countries, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Disaster and catastrophe are the appropriate words for shutting down USAid. It’s not just about people overseas who will be affected but there’s a likelihood of mpox or the next pandemic spreading to the United States,” said a US-based researcher who studies infectious diseases and asked for anonymity because of ongoing projects with the National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A global outbreak of mpox in 2022 led to more than 100,000 cases in 122 countries and marked the first time that the disease had spread outside of central or western &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak has largely been contained and the number of cases is low, in part due to widespread vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The more recent outbreak in DRC is a distinct variant from the mpox virus that caused the 2022 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio issued guidance that life-saving humanitarian assistance – including for food and medicine – may still be dispersed through a waiver despite the funding freeze. USAid workers said that while they have been seeking a waiver to continue mpox programming in the DRC, one had not been approved yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; officials have said their aim is to reduce wasteful spending and fraud, public health researchers criticized the speed and ferocity of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you’re gonna do these types of cuts, they have to be mindful,” said Amesh Adalja, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s this unpredictability that you can’t have if you’re trying to run a disease control program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When that’s pulled, Adalja explained, “making decisions about vaccine allocation, vaccine programs, testing strategies, is missing expert input, and that makes it harder for it makes it harder for control efforts”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While much of the agency’s programming remains halted, the future of USAid continues to be challenged in court cases. One federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; last Thursday that the aid freeze must be temporarily halted and gave the government five days to comply. Aid workers said the ruling has created confusion on how to restart programs that may be simply axed again shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Though USAid employees said in interviews they are most concerned about finding ways to continue the agency’s aid work, the last several weeks have been personally taxing as well, according to court testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Three USAid workers described the chaos of being pulled from the Democratic Republic of Congo on 28 January as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing federal workers. After protests broke out in Kinshasa, the embassy issued an order to evacuate. But with foreign aid frozen, Washington offices closed and many colleagues placed on administrative leave, USAid employees had little communication and were forced to fund their own evacuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4b49a43b-e311-4085-b6bb-eae1ad50db9f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":22,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Trump disrupting US bird flu response as outbreak worsens","elementId":"4b49a43b-e311-4085-b6bb-eae1ad50db9f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-bird-flu-response"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Workers described being shuttled into boats with their families with just enough space to hold a carry-on bag each on their laps or a backpack – many leaving pets and most of their belongings behind.

The United States was the biggest donor of the WHO and also benefited from sharing research with other countries it will no longer be privy to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If we blindfold ourselves and tie our hands, we’re not going to make ourselves safer,” said Morse. “We will just be less aware of what’s killing us or what’s making us sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 10:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE51bjBlSktDTVo2OVUtTjVmekpoaXdCa1BvLTF1emxnMU5GcjhQSWhnYUJyQjhlQUhrYjJfamQzVlNoalpKUFNPc2lzanYzYS1KUlhyZlR6azFoMUFYa0E3RFp0aF81akZMOUVISHlvajhOdw</guid></item><item><title>Triton Alumni Shine on 2025 Forbes 30 Under 30 List - University of California San Diego</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQbkRRTmJ6ZWFlTnNlbDJMVjNncFR6LVBaNDlpRkdQUUI0MFdueWhpbjlzZzNaUzBYYXhhQXlyVzRvcVlzX3ROSXo0eUtKUktfVmtRY1Q1MkQ4TVdtWFlBLXBfRlRLYnIyb0Eya0tYUVFFMFpVanJNWVRzXzNTVW0yZ1Q0eE1ia0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col col-left order-2 order-lg-1"&gt;
										&lt;p&gt;Today, Izhikevich leads the &lt;a href="https://ucla-scan.github.io/"&gt;Security and Networking (ScaN) Lab&lt;/a&gt; at UCLA, where she and her students apply data-driven methods to study internet security and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I love interacting with students,” she said. “I rely on them for thinking about the world in creative ways and proposing creative solutions. I think it’s key to have all these young minds who see the world slightly differently, to be able to essentially pitch in and propose ideas—that’s how we push science forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the UC system last July felt like coming “home” for Izhikevich. “On these UC campuses, you just feel it in everyone’s bones. Everyone’s there with a purpose. The students are very driven and motivated. I love the UC crowd,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her time at UC San Diego instilled in her not just technical expertise but a sense of balance—an ethos she says is embodied by &lt;a href="https://warren.ucsd.edu/"&gt;Earl Warren College&lt;/a&gt;’s motto, “Toward a life in balance.” “The computer science department really instills that as well,” Izhikevich said, adding that it’s something that she hopes to inculcate in the students working in her lab at UCLA. A daily yoga practice, which she started during her undergraduate years, remains an integral part of her routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond academic circles, Izhikevich sees her Forbes recognition as validation of her work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It shows that there is real impact being made,” she said. Whether optimizing satellite networks or guiding the next generation of computer scientists, Izhikevich is helping shape the future of internet security—one connection at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

For some, it’s never wanting to experience another hangover. For others, it’s a necessary sacrifice for their overall well-being. Whatever the reason, young Americans, ages 18–34, are focused on improving their health, according to a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996"}' href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coincides with a January 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf"&gt;advisory from the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy&lt;/a&gt;, warning of a “casual link” between increased risk of seven types of cancer (including breast [in women], colorectal, esophagus, voice box, liver, mouth, and throat) and drinking, highlighting alcohol use as a “leading preventable cause of cancer…contributing to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and about 20,000 cancer deaths each year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report is just the latest in decades of warnings that alcohol is harmful to people’s health. But that may not the sole—or even primary—cause of &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/nonalcoholic-bottle-shops-sober-curious-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;the substance’s downshift in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. Gallup reports that of the recent studies published concerning alcohol use and long-term health effects, “just 19% of US adults say they have heard ‘a great deal’ about such studies.” Thirty percent responded having heard “a fair amount,” while another 30% say they have “not heard much” and 21%, “nothing at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bon Appétit spoke to people across the country to hear their thoughts. For many, their choice to imbibe, abstain, drink less, or enjoy booze-free alternatives is deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ContentCardEmbedWrapper-kULtsE iGAJsG content-card-embed content-card-embed--stacked" data-testid="ContentCardEmbedWrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="ContentCardEmbedInfo-bDftKl bGnSrq"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="ContentCardEmbedDek" class="ContentCardEmbedDek-bA-DKch iuyVgm"&gt;While big box giants jump on the NA boom, mom-and-pop shops prioritize community with a personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natalie Pedraza, 24 (Monroe, LA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never drank before I went to college, and I was a bigger drinker then than I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like every other night, but since graduating, that’s died down a lot. Since moving to Northeast Louisiana, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; there is to do here is drink. It’s a small, Southern town—that’s what people do. I go to Wine Wednesdays, which wasn’t something I did when I first moved here, but it’s part of the culture. We’ll go out once, maybe twice a week drinking. A new restaurant, Apero, opened recently with a zero-proof gin and a mocktail list, but it’s not a regular thing here. If you’re not drinking alcohol here, you’re drinking Coke or Dr Pepper or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth disparity in Monroe is very large. For a lot of people, they’d rather spend $5 for a beer than $11 or $13 for something maybe better for you. It would be harder to find nonalcoholic alternatives here, to keep up with a [sober curious] lifestyle. I would have to go out of my way to do it. For me personally, the alternative is CBD or THC, but here there’s still a lot of stigma in the South around those. Alcohol is more socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do feel like everything nowadays causes cancer. [The surgeon general’s announcement] does make me rethink a lot of things. I’m thinking back to college and wondering how much I increased my risk, that does make me worried a little bit. But I also feel like, on social media for me, there are a lot of people that are health conscious on TikTok that make this information make sense a little bit more—especially with women. We’re targeted a little bit more.

This was the early ’00s, so no one batted an eye when I said I was on a diet. The body positivity movement hadn’t fully integrated with general society and we were expected to hate our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drew grids on printer paper and wrote out what I ate each day. One box for breakfast (nothing), one box for lunch (a rice cake), one box for dinner (carrot sticks). I was more concerned with not eating than I was with being skinny. Hunger was a proxy, a way to redirect bad feelings I didn’t know how to cope with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything could send me into a crash diet—lunchroom tension that put my already low social standing at risk. The classroom bully making fun of my socks. A tearful argument with my mom. My bouts of restriction were always preceded by a jittery, head-spinning buzz. I would later learn that this was a physical manifestation of anxiety, but all I knew at the time was that focusing on hunger helped alleviate my shaky nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each episode lasted a few days, a week at most. The bad feeling would fade, I’d become tired of feeling hungry, or my friends would start talking to me again. I never confronted my anxiety or developed skills to deal with my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in the winter of my sophomore year of college, I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. If you’ve ever been a sophomore in college with a boyfriend who cheated on you, you are aware that this is the worst thing in the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dove headfirst into a full-blown eating disorder. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Instead of confronting the ravaged ache of my teenage heart, I turned to what had always been there: restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eating disorders can (and do) develop on the basis of body image, they are often adaptive, which means the person engages in those behaviors for reasons other than weight loss. Focusing on pain within my control—hunger via restriction—was my panicked attempt at reclaiming power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picture myself at 19, walking out of the daylight down a wooded pathway that rapidly closes in, becoming narrower and more twisted until I am so tangled in branches I can’t move forward or turn back. If I’d known that 17 years into the future, at the age of 36, I would be sitting hunched over to hide my stomach, cringing at mirrors, and sobbing at the sight of my body in a dress, maybe I would have done something differently. Maybe I would have dedicated more energy to therapy, found healthy ways to process, accepted that sometimes life feels hard and then you get over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was 19 and did not know the future. I did not know patience. I had no way to understand that the shock of heartbreak is like riding a tidal wave that eventually loses momentum, settling back to the swells of daily life. At 19 I couldn’t imagine I’d ever be on the other side, so I did nothing except starve myself. And for the first time, I lost weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, my refusal to eat flew under the radar. Restriction is aligned with diet culture, making it a fairly acceptable form of behavioral control, at least to a certain extent. Plus, you get a lot of positive reinforcement when you lose weight. So when I started seeing physical results, something flipped in my brain and an already unhealthy coping mechanism turned into something more insidious, like a nest of snakes cracking through shells, flicking their forked tongues in the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was 19 and did not know the future. I did not know patience. I had no way to understand that the shock of heartbreak is like riding a tidal wave that eventually loses momentum, settling back to the swells of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soft padding of flesh around my hips shrank, then vanished. My D-cup chest shriveled to a C, then a B. I stood in front of the mirror one morning, dizzy with hunger and awe, tracing a finger around my protruding collarbone. I raised my arms over my head and saw the shadowed curves of one, two, three ribs. If I stood at just the right angle, I could glimpse air between my thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this, restricting had been about being hungry. But with this rapid weight loss, the snakes uncoiled in my brain, coming to life in the success of measurable metrics. I went from never weighing myself to stepping on the scale a dozen times a day. The hunger cramps and lightheadedness were worth it, as long as the number continued to drop. It wasn’t easy though—I craved food from the moment I woke up to the moment I curled around my gnawing, empty stomach and tried to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common misconception about eating disorders is that the person doesn’t want to eat. That isn’t always true, and certainly not for me. I thought about food all the time. I stared at girls eating—not in disgust but in envy. Sharing pastries outside coffee shops, tearing open energy bar wrappers in the gym lobby. I walked through the dining hall with my tray of food substitutes—fat-free Cool Whip, iceberg lettuce doused in ketchup—trying not to gape as I passed a dining hall employee shaking salt over a tray of french fries and sliding a pan of cheeseburgers under the heat lamp. But eating meant failure, and the earth-shaking loss of my relationship was already enough failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I developed strategies for keeping the hunger at bay, gnawing on bowls of air-popped popcorn and dry Fiber One cereal, mentally subtracting the fiber from the overall calories. I drank decaf instant coffee from morning until night, dumped packets of Splenda over bowls of slimy sugar-free JELL-O, did anything I could to create the illusion of flavor and food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to my own rules for what (and when) I could eat became increasingly stressful. Whispers spread through my social group about my weight loss and bizarre habits, and I started going to the dining hall alone, sitting at a two-top against the wall so no one could see my disordered facsimile of a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brain, which had always felt sharp, became confused and groggy. I felt trapped between sleep and wakefulness, unable to focus in class. I heard my sentences trail off through an echoing tunnel. I scanned my body obsessively every chance I got. I peered into the mirror to make sure I could still see the correct collarbone depth and angular bones jutting from behind my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eating meant failure, and the earth-shaking loss of my relationship was already enough failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my weight loss slowed—the body’s desperate bid to cling to calories—I doubled down on the rules that governed my life. No solid food until 12 p.m. After noon I could chew a piece of gum, and if I was about to pass out, I was allowed a bite of fat-free cottage cheese. In the evenings, I ate one green apple cut into 32 slices. I drank Diet Coke and instant coffee to fool my stomach into thinking it was full. I set impossible-to-reach standards of success that would finally let me be happy: a perfect day of restriction, a new and lower number on the scale. But the goal post kept moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late spring, all my waking hours revolved around not eating. I trailed behind my friends one evening, starving and exhausted as I pulled myself up the railing toward the student union building. It was late in the day and I had been “good,” following the rules without slipping up. This meant I’d had just half a cucumber, my allotted apple, and so much instant coffee my teeth were covered in fine silt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not waiting three hours for her to cross campus,” one of the girls snapped, tossing her flat-ironed hair over the collar of her North Face fleece. I paused and shoved a piece of gum in my mouth, trying to ease the sting of her words. The truth was, while being skinny was the most important part of my life, I was getting a little sick of feeling dull and starving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t eaten bread or butter or cookies or pasta or salad dressing in six months. I missed being able to walk up a flight of stairs. The thick wool around my brain was both maddening and alarming. &lt;em&gt;OK, &lt;/em&gt;I thought, watching my friends disappear into the building as I slowly ascended the steps. &lt;em&gt;Maybe it’s time to start eating again. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning I carefully folded a slice of wheat bread around a dab of peanut butter: a sad, eating-disordered version of a sandwich. I saved it for that afternoon, feeling the weight of it in my pocket as I crossed campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pulled the sandwich out of my pocket when I arrived for my shift at the gym. But then I froze, unable to pick it up.&lt;em&gt; If I eat this sandwich, what next? Bagels? Pizza? Cake? Ice cream? All of this discipline and success for nothing? Who will I be if I’m not skinny?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panic flooded my chest. I pinched off a piece of bread and rolled it between my fingers until it became a spongy marble. The desk phone rang shrilly, echoing the ringing in my ears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ignored the phone and stared at the sandwich. I tore it in half, then in half again. I shredded those four pieces until the sandwich lay scattered on the desk in 12 mutilated chunks. The phone rang again and I ignored it, my heart racing as I stared at the crumbled bread and peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My coworker hurried out of the back room balancing a pile of folders. He glared at me as he grabbed the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I swept the sandwich into the garbage without taking a bite. My head swam from hunger, but something else, too: the dark seed of fear that I’d gone too far, the snakes embedded in every crevice of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating this sandwich should be my choice, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No? OK then, what now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I somehow passed my finals and went home for the summer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents were horrified when they saw me, a skeletal shadow of the daughter they’d dropped off after Christmas break. My mother immediately booked a slew of appointments with a nutritionist, a primary care physician, and a therapist. I was over 18, but my parents paid my college tuition and the appointments were nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slumped mutely in the backseat of the minivan, ignoring her as we rode elevators up and down columns of identical office buildings, feeling nothing except a dull flash of pride the first time I heard the word &lt;em&gt;anorexia &lt;/em&gt;in hushed tones. At least I’d succeeded at something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My summer at home was a nightmare for everyone. My family begged me to have dinner with them, my mom pinched and pleading and my younger siblings staring silently at their plates. My dad was more understanding. He had quietly fought his own battles with body image and restriction throughout my childhood, but he was still helpless seeing how far I’d plunged down the rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have the words to say how I wanted to join them, or explain why I couldn’t. I would have loved to go to the ice cream stand or yell out topping suggestions when we called for pizza. I wanted to pile my dad’s famous meatballs on a heaping mound of pasta and elbow my sister for the green shaker of powdered parmesan. But I hovered in the doorway like a ghoul of an eldest daughter, desperate to be near food and warmth but too scared to take a bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not hungry,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night in August, I did join them for ice cream. We’d driven to an event together and I was too woozy to walk back to the house alone. Or maybe that’s not true. Maybe I didn’t need a ride back, but I was tired of arguing about food. Maybe I wanted to pretend I was normal. Maybe I just wanted to eat some fucking ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was my turn to order, the bored high schooler in a pastel baseball cap hovered her pen over the ticket. I opened my mouth to order the tasteless, sugar-free frozen yogurt from the back of the case, covered in ice crystals from neglect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can I have a large sundae, with mint chip, rocky road, sprinkles, and extra hot fudge?” I asked, my voice high-pitched and unfamiliar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later my order appeared in the window. A sloppy, overflowing bowl of ice cream with hot fudge dripping down the side and a maraschino cherry leaking electric red dye down the sagging pile of whipped cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I inhaled the sundae in a frantic, bug-eyed rush. My siblings pretended not to stare, but I could feel the tension drain as I ate. &lt;em&gt;She’s eating ice cream. Maybe she’s going to get better; maybe this is over. &lt;/em&gt;They chattered over each other as they dug into their cones, the rise and fall of  conversation a backdrop to the dopamine receptors firing so hard I could barely see straight. The taste of real food made me swoon: thick, creamy ice cream, crunchy sprinkles, gooey fudge hardened into sticky clumps. I scraped the bottom of the dish so hard I bent the plastic spoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colors of the outdoor patio felt saturated, like my vision was turned up to superhero level. My voice sounded like it was coming through a tunnel as I said: &lt;em&gt;be right back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little dairy hut had a one-stall private bathroom. And ice cream, as it turned out, was one of the easiest things to get back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever I’d been before—the on-and-off restriction, the full-blown anorexia, somewhere in between—bulimia was so much worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain purity in restriction, an ethereal perfection in refusing food. You are elevated, you don’t &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;like others do. In the hierarchy of eating disorders, anorexia is at the top. To be diagnosed with anorexia is a symbol of willpower and control. Bulimia is the opposite. It means giving in to hedonistic, animal cravings. You are always doing something wrong (eating), then atoning for it (purging). It is a descent straight to hell and I was powerless to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I ate the ice cream, there was no going back. Every morning I woke up and prepared to battle my mind and body, begging the two to cooperate and not wind up in an out-of-control nighttime binge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d make it through most of the day, then fall apart at night. Soon there were multiple fugue-like binges each day. My electrolytes became so skewed I’d see stars when I stood up, and I built a mental map of single-stall campus bathrooms where I could jam my fingers down my throat until blood vessels burst in my eyes and the corners of my lips split apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be diagnosed with anorexia is a symbol of willpower and control. Bulimia is the opposite. It means giving in to hedonistic, animal cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lost whatever remained of my brain power. My head was so fuzzy I’d set the shampoo outside of the shower door after I’d used it, then put the conditioner out afterwards. Otherwise I’d have no memory of what stage of hair washing I was at, repeating the lather and rinse so many times I’d start crying from confusion and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My world was reduced to fear, hunger, and shame. There was no self anymore. &lt;em&gt;I feel like everything is gray and I miss color&lt;/em&gt;, I scrawled in a barely legible journal entry, one of only a few coherent thoughts in a notebook filled with run-on sentences panicking about food and weight and sadness and self-loathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand (or even perhaps empathize with) the eating-disordered mind requires some suspension of disbelief. You have to accept that after a certain point, very little of it makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like a rat trapped in a maze with no finish, running into walls and getting electrocuted at every turn. I wanted out of the hellscape I’d created, but I had formed a whole identity around the latticework of visible bones and tendons; my days were structured around the denial of food. To give up the eating disorder meant losing the core of who I had become. If I lost control over the core of my being, it would mean I failed. If I failed . . . I didn’t have an answer for what happened after failure. It was too terrifying to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family lived within driving distance, and one night my mom dropped me back on campus after my sister’s birthday dinner. I’d swayed in a chair all night, shifting from side to side on my bony butt, spots dancing in front of my eyes as I tried to resist binging on ice cream cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom was quiet on the drive, but as we pulled up to my apartment building, she pushed a trifold pamphlet into my chapped hands. I tilted it toward the window, squinting at &lt;em&gt;Walden Center for Behavioral Health&lt;/em&gt; printed in black over a watercolor of two people walking a flower-lined path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is this?” I asked, pinching it between two fingers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a residential program,” she said. “A special program for eating disorders.” She flinched almost imperceptibly as the words hovered between us. I was prone to eruptions at any mention of doctors, therapy, or eating, so I can’t imagine the guts it took for her to hand me this pamphlet, how she must have felt on the drive to campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;talked &lt;/em&gt;to them?” I hissed, flinging the seatbelt so hard over my shoulder it hit the door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maggie,” she said, her voice shaking but measured. “You need help. We are terrified. Do it for your siblings, dad, myself. School, riding horses, running. Please, we miss you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m. Fine.” I could hear the low pitch of my voice building into simmering rage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She held her ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lunged out of the car, slamming the door as she sat with her hands curled around the steering wheel, staring at her lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, I pulled the pamphlet out of my desk drawer and called the number. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember the exact moment I called, or what made me do it. I told people that I’d fainted in the shower and hit my head hard enough to be scared for my life. I didn’t want to lie, but I felt the need to justify giving up the eating disorder. It wasn’t enough to just want my life back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I did want my life back. Desperately. I felt like being dead would be better than continuing to exist. I weighed less than 100 pounds. It hurt to sit and to stand, my knuckles bled from scraping them against my teeth, and I nearly fainted every time I stood up. My friends couldn’t stand me, my family was scared of me, I couldn’t put together a full sentence, and I missed who I used to be as a person. That was it. Those were my reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I checked into Walden the day after Christmas of my junior year. I’d wound up following a not-uncommon trajectory: More than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3684068/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;50 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with bulimia have a history of anorexia. The rigid restriction I’d put myself through was unsustainable in the long term, and like other patients, had led to binge eating and compensatory purging. By the time I dragged my floral duffel through the sliding doors of Walden, I fit the criteria for “restrictive bulimia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden Center had four units on the ground floor of a beautiful apartment building in eastern Massachusetts. Residents moved apartments as they progressed through the program, rewarded with less supervision and more privileges at each stage. I started in the first apartment, with open-door bathroom monitoring, no outside walks beside a brief daily dose of fresh air, and one slow, supervised yoga session every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden’s program was fairly standard for a residential facility. Along with weight restoration and interrupting eating disorder behaviors, treatment emphasized relearning how to have a normal relationship with food. With supervision, we made shopping lists and cooked our own meals. It was a far cry from the trays of hospital food I’d imagined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each resident had their own daily requirements, which included portions of grains, proteins, fats, fruits, and vegetables. There were no mentions of calories, just a list of foods under each category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of grains alone contained a cornucopia of illegal food: oatmeal, bagels, english muffins, bread, cereal, granola bars. Proteins were even more thrilling: Greek yogurt, string cheese, cream cheese, bacon, hamburgers, beans. Foods I hadn’t eaten outside of hollow-eyed, guilt-ridden binges in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I settled in quickly, determined to learn the rules and do everything well. Each week we huddled around Stop &amp;amp; Shop delivery forms, consulting each other as a counselor sat at the table with one ear tuned to the conversation. We had to create a weekly grocery list that would stock the pantry for our meals. It was a simple task that stretched our brains to their limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stared at the list of food, moving a stubby pencil between rice, honey, half and half, chicken. &lt;em&gt;What does a normal meal look like? &lt;/em&gt;It doesn’t look like stewed tomatoes eaten from the can, but it also doesn’t look like a pint of Ben and Jerry’s, a bag of Goldfish, four bowls of Frosted Flakes, and half a jar of hot fudge followed by 30 minutes in the bathroom turning my stomach inside out before collapsing with a tear-streaked cheek pressed to the tile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three times per day, each apartment’s residents gathered in the kitchens to make meals that fulfilled our requirements. Emotions ran high and the counselors were present to both calm us and approve our choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I need three grains, two proteins, a vegetable, and two fats for dinner, this could mean a baked potato, a hamburger on a bun, a side of baked beans, and two servings of butter on the potato. Once I explained the meal to the counselor and showed them each measured component as I added it to my plate, they’d jot their initials next to my name and I could take a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dutifully fulfilled my meal requirements. I held my arm out for blood pressure and vitals checks each morning and night and was weighed on a blind scale every other day. I participated in nutrition classes, suffered through weekly family therapy, and shoved my clothes into my bag every 10 days as I moved to the next apartment. The second apartment had closed-door bathroom privileges, the third had a longer outdoor walk each day. It was progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d all voluntarily checked in, but we clung to shreds of control where we could. One of my roommates did push-ups in the bathroom. We lifted food packages surreptitiously to the light, trying to find an angle that allowed us to see the Sharpied-over nutrition facts. I circled the fountain on supervised walks, chatting with another girl who had also been a runner. A counselor always called us back, clocking the attempt at exercising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still hesitated at the table, under-measured the butter for my mashed potatoes, filled the measuring cup with water and a splash of milk for opacity before turning to the counselor to check off my protein category. I still nodded slightly when one of the girls, wearing compression socks for edema, gave a tiny head shake as I reached for the refried beans for my protein one night. I drifted my hand toward the black beans: lower calories and fat. She nodded just perceptibly before going back to preparing her own meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tiring push-pull, releasing the hold of a psychiatric disorder. But other than the occasional miserable family therapy session or rapidly corrected eating disorder behaviors, the program was calm and quiet. None of us had much energy, and the emotional toll of weight gain kept us low-key. The days blended together, the passage of time marked by each meal or completing another 1,000-piece puzzle. The misery of restriction, the monstrous feeling of a binge, the desperation of a purge—they were all replaced by new emotions. There was the minor frustration of a tangled, lumpy knitting project, the glee at placing the final jigsaw puzzle piece, the spark of pride during a joyful moment in group therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-light-gray-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left Walden after four weeks, having regained enough weight to medically stabilize. I had a plan for outpatient counseling and dietitian checkups, and my own set of measuring cups so I could continue my restoration plan at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drove myself to my nutrition appointments between classes and horseback riding at the university stable, and I started running again, relishing the clear-headed energy and swell of muscle in my quads. I slipped up here and there, but within two years of leaving Walden, I was declared recovered. There were no rampant eating-disordered behaviors and the number on the scale stayed within a reasonable range. The coil of snakes lay dormant, and as far as I and my medical team were concerned, we’d eradicated them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was good for a time. I moved out west after graduating, and I devoted my next decade to a newfound love of the outdoors. My social life revolved around activity: I was a strong climber, a capable mountain biker, and I backpacked at a punishing pace, covering hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain alone and unafraid. None of these elements would have been possible without a strong body, and because I was so fit, I effortlessly maintained that lean strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no fear of food or body shame during those years. But the shadow was still somewhere in my brain, the coiled snakes stilled by my multi-sport fitness and high mileage in the mountains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I see my eating disorder still showed up in sneaky ways. I joked about how I didn’t enjoy cooking, fielded comments about the speed at which I ate, and attributed the fact that I cleaned the kitchen completely before eating to being tidy. In reality, I still associated food with guilt. I ate fast to get it over with and remove any evidence I had made food. Additionally, my high level of activity meant I was constantly trading calories back and forth in my mind, a background abacus with the beads click-clacking back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I thought my eating disorder would stay quiet forever, I was wrong. A few years ago, the combination of a naturally slowing metabolism and pandemic-induced lifestyle change altered my body. My pants stopped buttoning smoothly, my outline softened. I couldn’t tell you exactly what was different, but I knew something had changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I was confused. I opened a slew of tabs on my phone, scrolling through piles of unhelpful SEO clickbait. Was seltzer making me bloated? Was I biking too much and not running enough? The dormant shadow, the coil of snakes in my brain woke up, stretched, shook themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started obsessing over my body in a way I hadn’t since college. I avoided mirrors, kept the lights off in the bathroom, and wrapped a towel around my body before stepping out of the shower. I went from wearing dresses, skirts, crop tops, and matching workout sets to baggy shirts and high-rise leggings with wide elastic waistbands. I stood slightly bent over and pushed my hands into my pockets to hold my clothes out from my body, walking down the street like a polyester circus tent. It didn’t help that the body positivity trends of the past several years seemed to have vanished in the blink of an algorithm, and suddenly I was being spoon-fed a steady stream of thin-is-in videos that sent me reeling back to the magazine covers of my college years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body dysmorphia flared as fast and hot as my eating disorder had 15 years before. The all-consuming thoughts stretched back to my 19-year-old self, sobbing on the floor, vowing never to eat again after being cheated on. Now, here I was in my mid-30s, my brain short-circuiting on a trip to Europe because there were too many store-window reflections, I’d packed the wrong clothes, and the restaurants made me feel full. I spent an hour-long bus ride deleting every photo of myself where my arms were visible, my thighs were touching, and the outline of my stomach showed through my shirt. I pulled away from my boyfriend and stared at the floor in the claustrophobic elevators, the mirrored walls a reflective torment. Everywhere I looked, there I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I broke down in my therapist’s office when I returned, gesturing at my body as I grasped for a pillow to hold over my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look at me,” I sobbed, “what’s happening to my body?” My brain writhed, hot, like a rock had been pushed aside to release the pit of vipers. My therapist was quiet for a moment, letting my words echo in the small office. She passed me a box of tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what we’re looking at is body dysmorphia,” she said. I hiccuped and shook my head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said, “I know what I look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t know what I looked like, I still don’t. Present tense. The unfortunate truth of eating disorders is that no matter how “recovered” you feel, act, and look, there are some elements that might never go away. Body dysmorphia is the last thing to go, if it ever does. To be trapped in this mind is like revisiting the most potent mental and emotional elements of the eating disorder without the physical symptoms and behaviors. And it’s all inward facing—I do not judge bodies of different shapes and sizes. This cruelty is solely reserved for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet sands down the edges of body dysmorphic disorder. Except for the most severe cases (in which people might undergo cosmetic surgery), search results tell you that someone with body dysmorphia might avoid mirrors, or perhaps compare how they look to other people. It sounds like someone having a bad hair day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These surface-level explainers don’t reveal what it’s like to &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt; in that brain. To be unable to concentrate because of your waistband rolled down, to have your day ruined by the wrong angle in the wrong mirror, to leave your partner alone on the couch because oops, you remembered that you have a body and that they might touch it. As long as you are awake, you are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand how stunningly stupid it is to spend this much time thinking about the softness of my stomach or the width of my arms. Throw a dart anywhere on a map and you’ll find someone having a worse day, week, month, or life than me. But I cannot convince my disordered brain this battle is not worth fighting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you are awake, you are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They weighed me at the doctor’s office in 2008 and declared me recovered, but in reality, eating disorder researchers cannot agree on how to define true recovery. It’s easy to measure “healthy” weight with simple metrics to determine medical stability. It’s somewhat harder—but still relatively straightforward—to determine whether the person is engaging in eating disorder behaviors. Severe restriction? Binging and purging? Creating “meals” with foods that should not be combined? That’s all pretty obvious. But what about panic at the sight of mirrors, distress at the cling of clothing? Eating so fast you almost choke because you need to get it over with? Spiraling because your sleeves felt tight? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based psychotherapist Erika Bent is a certified eating disorder specialist supervisor. She studied anorexia as a researcher before transitioning to clinical and residential work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The psychology that you’re describing is harder to measure,” Bent tells me as I describe limiting my access to mirrors and leaving the lights off lest I catch a glimpse of my reflection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body image distress is one of the last things to be resolved in eating disorder recovery,” she says, adding that this is such a standard experience for people with a history of eating disorders that it even has a name: “normative discontent.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel better in that I’m not alone. I feel worse in that this might be how my brain works forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fall morning, I scan the address numbers above a sidewalk I’ve walked every week for years, following the blue dot on my phone screen to a door I’ve never noticed. The Eating Disorder Center of Montana has two locations, and this one is right off the main road on a busy side street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find myself anxiously rehearsing my introduction as I climb the stairs, even though I’ve already told Lauren Stille, the lead dietitian, that I’m here as a journalist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of literature but not a lot of consensus about long-term recovery, and I have many questions. I’m so trapped in my head I’m secretly hoping she’s going to give me some good news: Body dysmorphia has a timeline, that I will soon wear the dozens of outfits in my closet and not the same (safe) pair of baggy sweatpants-and-sweatshirt combo. That I can move on after eating a large meal and not dissolve into hysterics because I feel full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dysmorphia is a terrible, crippling thing,” Stille says. She is relaxed in a leather chair while I’m hunched on the couch across from her, leaning forward to hide my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reiterate throughout the conversation that I’m only here for this essay, but she’s a therapist and an expert in the field of eating disorders. She knows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing [body dysmorphia] become more and more common,” she continues, telling me that it can escalate by how often the media draws attention to our bodies, insisting everything can be improved and modified. “You don’t like something about yourself? You can fix it and that’s the ticket to happiness.” I circle back to my eating-disordered thoughts from 15 years ago. &lt;em&gt;If I just have a perfect restriction day, if I just reach this new number on the scale. Then I’ll feel good. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tells me what I already know: Recovery is complicated. And these days, they’re trying to emphasize that there is no straightforward way to say &lt;em&gt;I’m recovered. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s more that ‘my eating disorder is currently quieter,’” Stille says&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Your entire future is about continuing that work of recovery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh god,” I say, tapping the recorder to check the time, but really to avoid eye contact. “That is grim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s little data on the mental and emotional outcomes in long-term eating disorder recovery, especially past the 10-year mark. One &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883487/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;22-year study&lt;/a&gt; describes a shift in the therapeutic approach. Rather than treating for strict recovery guidelines, treatment should match a patient’s goals, which might not look like traditional recovery. This is a start, and helps encourage the idea that success doesn’t always operate on a binary. If anything, this could help minimize treatment and counseling dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the long-term studies that do exist &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/eat.20443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mostly follow patients&lt;/a&gt; with the resources to be in treatment, or to get diagnosed in the first place. Everything from clinical therapy to inpatient treatment is expensive and exclusive. To even begin untangling the process requires understanding complex medical systems and insurance providers. I had the privilege of my family’s health insurance, but people in less advantaged circumstances don’t have the same resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until my body dysmorphia spiked in the last two years, I rarely thought about my oddly fast eating habits or that I was subconsciously using exercise as a projection for feeling good about my body. It’s pretty crushing to learn that this might be the way my brain works for the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does, however, make me feel marginally better to learn that some elements might not have been within my control. While the cultural fixation on thinness is an important and disturbingly prevalent factor in the development of eating disorders, only a minimal percentage of people are affected to the extent I was. Given that so many people are exposed to the same cultural messaging, why aren’t more people affected to the same degree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics seem to play an increasingly large role, and research is starting to indicate that some people may have a latent vulnerability to eating disorders, similar to alcoholism. These tendencies might never be “turned on” without the right combination of environmental factors, but that genetic potential—plus a high instance of comorbidity with anxiety—created the perfect petri dish for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brain should be full of wonder and gratitude for my life: joy at finally keeping my houseplants alive, excitement as I plan next season’s travels, pride after finishing another rugged backcountry trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I plan trips around whether or not I’ll have to wear a bathing suit. I fling clothes onto the floor in a heap if they fit the wrong way. I crumple to the ground because my stomach touches my overalls in a way it didn’t last summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I traveled to the desert this fall to help connect shuttles and food caches during a five-day backcountry trip. My partner and I led the group through sandstone arches, slot canyons, and desert oases most people will never see. I carried 60 pounds of supplies on my back and hiked alone into the canyon to set the cache, quads and glutes and back and shoulders moving fast over miles of cracked mud flats under a punishing sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was proud of my strong, capable, dust-caked body in the Southern Utah backcountry. I am tough on the trails where I’ve found my footing over the past decade. I’ve seen places on this planet I could have never imagined as I stared out the window of Walden Center that winter 15 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the pride is conditional, and I can’t predict when the switch will flip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in town I shed my reeking layers in a dingy Motel 6. The flickering bulb cast a sickly fluorescent light on my stomach, thighs, and arms. My body—which felt so powerful climbing out of the canyon just hours before—was reduced to a slab of pale, dimpled flesh, the &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; picture on a social media slideshow or 2006 diet-ad billboard. All I did was flick the light on, and my joy from the desert dissolved in the reality of being myself, chained to the dregs of a decades-long eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shame and disgust at my body turned to tears as the water ran gritty and brown down my filthy legs. I stare at the rust around the drain and think: &lt;em&gt;Someone, please, get me out of my head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels painfully indulgent to have had an eating disorder, even more so to still be held captive by it. To have had all the privilege and food in the world, yet spend untold hours thinking about the imperfections of a body that has tried so hard to be good for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I think about the elements that make up a life, will any of my accomplishments include skipping dessert? Do I get an award for having a salad instead of a burger? I will never be remembered for the two years I had a thigh gap or that I dragged myself to the gym 100 days in a row. Saying no to food didn’t make my problems go away, it replaced them with other problems—when I came through the other side, the original problems were still there. If I’d known what this would have looked like in the future, would I have tried harder at 19 to avoid it? Would I even have been able to? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, more than 15 years after being declared recovered, I can tell you that sometimes there’s no tidy, closed loop with a psychiatric disorder. And that talking about it in the present tense can be the most realistic way to address it. For now, my hope is that someday I can return from the desert or the mountains, turn on the bathroom light, glance at my body in the mirror, and just say &lt;em&gt;thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.maggieslepian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maggie Slepian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a full-time writer based in Montana.

&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://asthmatool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Asthma Tool&lt;/a&gt;, the free software allows users to track their symptoms and triggers and to use wearable devices to monitor vitals, like resting heart rate, for signs that asthma may be acting up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Millions of people live with the chronic respiratory condition, in which people’s airways become blocked, and key management strategies include avoiding triggers and using medication to prevent worsening of symptoms that can land people in the hospital. Asthma Tool is intended to help users better understand their asthma so they can better manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also produced within the body's cells when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight hit the skin, triggering vitamin D synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what the source, though, vitamin D must be activated within the body—first through the liver, which converts vitamin D to calcidiol, and then in the kidney, which forms what's known as calcitriol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once activated, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut, prevents muscle cramps and spasms, and leads to healthy bone growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D also plays a role in reducing inflammation, immune function, and glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does vitamin D give you energy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of research backs the idea that vitamin D may help put some pep in your step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5207540/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the results of two groups with fatigue and vitamin D deficiency—one of which was given vitamin D supplements, the other a placebo. In just four weeks, the group given vitamin D experienced significant improvements in energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a small &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/archive/2013/04/vitamindproventoboostenergyfromwithinthecells.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study out of the U.K.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study out of the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; found vitamin D vital for making our muscles work efficiently and boosting energy levels. It showed that muscle function improves with vitamin D supplements, suggesting that fatigue could be due to "reduced efficiency of the mitochondria: the ‘power stations’ within each cell of the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081585/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study of soccer players;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study of soccer players&lt;/a&gt; found a link between vitamin D and improved athletic performance; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5457862/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:another found;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;another found&lt;/a&gt; vitamin D improved the energy levels of recent kidney transplant patients.

"Testing for vitamin deficiencies, such as vitamin D and &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/vitamin-b12-supplements-energy-boost/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;, especially in vegetarians, is crucial. Additionally, I would screen for thyroid disorders if other symptoms suggest such a condition, and I would also rule out anemia and &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/iron-deficiency-anemia-fatigue-brain-fog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iron deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to identify the underlying cause accurately to ensure appropriate and effective treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts caution that a supplement is unlikely to help if you're not deficient in a nutrient. Still, notes a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/supplements-a-scorecard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harvard newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s very hard to get the vitamin D you need from your diet; oily fish and fortified dairy products are the only important sources." An analysis of 2013–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/usual/Usual_Intake_gender_WWEIA_2013_2016.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showed that 92% of men and more than 97% of women ingested insufficient amounts of vitamin D daily from food and beverages. So supplements likely make sense for most adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once vitamin D supplements are determined to be appropriate, exercise caution when making your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be wary of supplements that are far cheaper than the rest or look like a good deal,” &lt;a href="https://drbrighten.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jolene Brighten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jolene Brighten&lt;/a&gt;, naturopathic endocrinologist and author of &lt;em&gt;Is This Normal?&lt;/em&gt;, previously &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/best-supplements-boost-energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fortune.&lt;/em&gt; “Often these are using poor quality ingredients, and in some cases … they won’t actually have what the label lists.” (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates supplements, but doesn't approve them for safety or effectiveness before they are sold to the public.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers may want to consult the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements];elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements]&lt;/a&gt; as well as subscription-based sources, such as &lt;a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Consumer Lab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Consumer Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which looks into issues ranging from possible contaminants to making sure a supplement contains what it claims to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin D do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommended daily intake for adults up to age 70 is 600 IU and 800 IU for adults over 70, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. Brighten adds, "It is also important to be getting enough sunlight.” She also underscores the importance of testing D levels to help determine what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't overdo it on supplements, caution experts. Taking too much vitamin D can be toxic in rare cases, as with an 89-year-old U.K. man &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/vitamin-d-toxicity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:who died last year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;who died last year&lt;/a&gt; in part from vitamin D toxicity (though he did have several underlying conditions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, notes the Office of Dietary Supplements, vitamin D can interact poorly with some medications, including statins and steroids, so be sure to discuss with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally published on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://fortune.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on Oct. 5, 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on nutrition and supplements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was originally featured on &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/does-vitamin-d-give-you-energy-supplements-d3-boost-levels-help/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 09:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFAxSE91TkVyQnNLaWxMMm85bVktRXhzZEM5NHF5cjJsQlVadXNRMEowZ19UdUd0SEdhTHhQWjZ0TTBTUDlzWWgzM0N3V0lOSGxNWnpKX1lCcU96cEp0OUl4eG1oM1BRVVZ1Yzhpb3ZFNWs</guid></item><item><title>Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPSlRDai1GQ2pVaVRKeHVpLTJHUjdERHhKdFM1UXVyT3U5MUI1TWsxV015S05ya25jVmRlcG9uMi1XVFM4Q1UzaU9BZ1A4QzE5dUMtaGNTT3o1Qi1QdkFSWVpURU5laG5BZ0U5aURYN3lVY3VDaVJhejBDbFltTTY3VTVfZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @heyitsgingerandpepper / Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A romantic dinner can evoke warmth, excitement, and the joy of shared moments, even if one of the attendees happens to be a charming feline. In a delightful twist on a classic dinner date, an orange cat named Ginger has captured the hearts of viewers after a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFn2UpSyIQm/?igsh=MWpocnh3NXl1ajU2Mg==" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; featuring her waiting patiently for her date at a candle-lit table went viral on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cat waits patiently at a dinner date in viral video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Instagram video — shared by user @heyitsgingerandpepper — captures Ginger as she sits poised at a miniature table adorned with red roses, flickering candles, and even a bottle of Champagne. The setting, complete with rose petals scattered on the floor, sets the perfect scene for a romantic rendezvous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger’s owner, Kim, humorously explained to &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ginger-cat-sat-candle-lit-table-ready-her-date-waiting-you-1777552" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Newsweek;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; that the feline decided to mimic her “hoomans” by organizing a date night of her own. The feline feast featured cat wine and chicken cat food, followed by a cozy cuddle session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video’s charm has not gone unnoticed. It has quickly become a sensation among cat lovers on Instagram, amassing over 3 million likes and 7,480 comments as of Thursday. Comments from users express admiration for the cat’s demeanor and the overall scene. One user wrote, “Who would need a man when you have Ginger.” Another said, “Cutest Valentine!!!! Whomever spends Valentine’s Day with this cutie tomorrow, is one LUCKY individual!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters also speculated about Ginger’s intentions, with one predicting a proposal and another joking that they’d rather be on this date than any they could find on dating apps. Others were moved by the cat’s apparent happiness and cuteness, suggesting they’d arrive “2 hours early just to have extra time” with Ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that cats do form attachments similar to those seen between children and their parents, which perhaps explains why so many people find such joy in Ginger’s video. Despite their &lt;a href="https://cattime.com/features/50660-are-cats-domesticated-science" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:independent nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;independent nature&lt;/a&gt;, studies have shown that cats feel comforted by their owners’ presence and can even experience distress when separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://cattime.com/news/59928-video-cat-waiting-for-date-viral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://cattime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CatTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CatTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:54:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPSlRDai1GQ2pVaVRKeHVpLTJHUjdERHhKdFM1UXVyT3U5MUI1TWsxV015S05ya25jVmRlcG9uMi1XVFM4Q1UzaU9BZ1A4QzE5dUMtaGNTT3o1Qi1QdkFSWVpURU5laG5BZ0U5aURYN3lVY3VDaVJhejBDbFltTTY3VTVfZw</guid></item><item><title>This Painful Syndrome Is Sending Cannabis Users to the ER – Are You at Risk? - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPOG5fWXVPcEQ3M2JFQXhnVldiblZZdWJKT2JZNmNGYUdWdzhDMEtVeUpRRjFBN3JEZmhkYXFRWHhDUldZbGFTNU5rWE1fMTlYOWotU0Z2aGg0bkg2aHlHdHA1c3RxcFl4V0oyQ1hkbG9yRnpMdUJLZFc5RDhFTktkZ0V1YnpBdXgxVGtlM1B0ak5YVXlCR3FWaldveHNoNFdQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPOG5fWXVPcEQ3M2JFQXhnVldiblZZdWJKT2JZNmNGYUdWdzhDMEtVeUpRRjFBN3JEZmhkYXFRWHhDUldZbGFTNU5rWE1fMTlYOWotU0Z2aGg0bkg2aHlHdHA1c3RxcFl4V0oyQ1hkbG9yRnpMdUJLZFc5RDhFTktkZ0V1YnpBdXgxVGtlM1B0ak5YVXlCR3FWaldveHNoNFdQ</guid></item><item><title>Weekly News Quiz: Feb. 20 - AARP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNOXdNV2RYNTRzMldxdnpJTmx6MkNUM3drV0dUeHltbHlKV0RUMmhGX0JFWlhCUGJ5OVhMNXM4ZHhjenR4S1NBSGgta1lBb21uT1d1STJra0RQQ21WRWhFaHIzZjRwZVA4Ny1kN2VhZ3BFZ2N6eHhmbW54bXhka0tyWThn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="aarp-uxdia-leaving-modal-content aarp-uxdia-leaving-modal-content@tablet aarp-uxdia-leaving-modal-content@laptop"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Disposable plastic containers could be leaching dangerous chemicals into your takeaway food, potentially increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments on rats, researchers in China have found evidence that drinking water exposed to the various chemical additives that seep from heated plastic packaging causes changes to the body, that begin with altered gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodents that ingested this cocktail of plastic contaminants for just three months showed broken or misaligned fibers, inflammatory cell infiltration, and mitochondrial swelling in their heart tissue. They also showed bleeding between myocardial cells, as marked by the black pentagrams in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152637" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152637" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-642x543.jpg" alt="Rat Heart Health" class="size-medium wp-image-152637" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-642x543.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-490x415.jpg 490w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-768x650.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-1536x1300.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-2048x1734.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-600x508.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152637" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Heart tissue of rodents in group A, B, C, and D, with D being the control group. The black arrow represents inflammatory cell infiltration, and the black pentagram represents intercardiomyocyte bleeding. (Wu et al., &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the same occurs in the human body is unknown, but the findings suggest that heated plastic containers may not be a safe vehicle for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wait for more research, the authors of the study at Ningxia Medical University in China &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;, "It is essential to avoid using plastic containers for high-temperature food".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their experiments on rats were prompted by a survey of 3,179 older adults in China. Those who reported higher exposure to plastic on a questionnaire were more likely to suffer congestive heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-in-blood-clots-in-heart-brain-and-legs"&gt;concerning research&lt;/a&gt; has found microplastics accumulating in blood clots within the human brain, heart, and legs, so epidemiologist Yueping Wu and their colleagues decided to investigate the cardiovascular effects further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three months, they fed 24 rodents the chemicals that are leached from plastic containers when they are heated by boiling tap water, which include compounds such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-plastic-additives-may-have-affected-the-health-of-millions"&gt;BPA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-plastic-additives-may-have-affected-the-health-of-millions"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, and various &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-shocked-at-daily-level-of-plasticizers-in-californias-air"&gt;plasticizers&lt;/a&gt;. These 'leachates' were produced by placing plastic containers in hot tap water for durations of 1, 5, and 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, rodents that drank the contaminated water had an altered intestinal microenvironment compared to the eight control rodents that did not. Their gut microbiomes had altered significantly after exposure to plastic and its chemicals, including changes to flora associated with inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood of these exposed animals also showed a spike in inflammatory immune messengers, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These changes might be linked to plastic product leachates disrupting microbiota and inflammatory factors, which then trigger inflammation and myocardial damage," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152639" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-642x367.jpg" alt="Rat Heart Tissue " class="size-medium wp-image-152639" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-642x367.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-726x415.jpg 726w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-600x343.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Myocardial tissue of rats exposed to plastic contaminants.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microwaving-safe-plastics-can-release-billions-of-particles-scientists-warn"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that microwaving plastic food containers can release microplastics and nanoplastics into the meal, even if the containers claim to be microwave-safe. As few as three minutes can release billions of tiny plastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152625" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic.jpg" alt="Microwave Plastic" class="size-full wp-image-152625" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic-600x186.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152625" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microwaving releases microplastics.

It's also a mystery as to how long the fragments stick around for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-in-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; on clogged arteries in human patients have found tiny fragments of plastic accumulating in more than 50 percent of plaques. Within roughly 34 months of surgery, those with plastics in their arteries were 4.5 times more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or death compared to those where no plastic was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the body is exposed to plastic contaminants, researchers suspect there's a chance the additives can reduce the activity of antioxidant enzymes and trigger the body's inflammatory reaction, leaving it exposed to cardiovascular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-642x297.png" alt="Plastics Microscopy" class="size-medium wp-image-152629" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-642x297.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-898x415.png 898w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-768x355.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-600x277.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy.png 1286w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Jagged plastic particles were seen inside macrophages and deposits of fatty tissue, removed from clogged arteries.

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132800"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt;, scientists discovered that when people put hot, disposable plastic cutlery in their mouths, it reduces their diversity of intestinal microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;

The department of health recorded more than 28,000 cases in January, an increase of 40% compared with the same time period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d00ce813-0929-46b4-8f4e-6fc6ffc21e3b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;One resident shows the 9 pesos he received from the 45 mosquito larvas he captured.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Aaron Favila/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Earlier this week, the department announced a “concerning rise” in dengue in nine areas in the Philippines. Quezon City, the country’s most populous city, declared a dengue outbreak on Saturday after 10 deaths since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, there are concerns the village bounty programme may inadvertently backfire, if people start propagating mosquitoes to reap the rewards, department spokesperson Albert Domingo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Domingo said he was not condemning the move, but added: “If you are willing to give prize money for something, maybe we could consider contests for cleanliness,” with neighborhoods competing to clear away areas with stagnant water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The project also sparked concern on social media, with commenters warning of potential mosquito farming for profit. “We must make sure that our solutions are sustainable and have no unintended consequences,” read one comment on one of Cernal’s posts about the initiative. “Reevaluate this project because I don’t find it effective” another comment read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In response to the criticisms, Cernal emphasised in a Facebook post that he had “no ill intentions” with the programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 06:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Laskey was taken to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary after the attack in February 2023, where doctors found he had lost all sight in his left eye as the acid had gone through the inner and outer layers of his cornea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Over the next eight months, the 43-year-old underwent two emergency transplants and three amniotic tissue grafts, made from donated placenta. This means that doctors can now move on to treatments that could restore his lost vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Laskey, a plumbing and heating engineer, said: “I was told from day one that it wasn’t about saving the sight, it was about saving the eye, and then we can work on that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;He added: “I’m so thankful to the mother who chose to donate her placenta to help people like me who are at risk of losing their sight completely. It’s incredible to know that a new life can help so many people in such a profound way, using something that’s usually thrown away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Amnion grafts are lightweight, elastic and almost transparent sheets created by taking tissue from the inner lining of a placenta. They can heal damage to the surface of the eye while also providing anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cc37b590-fc0f-418a-b4d3-7f938941f89e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;An amnion graft, made from the inner lining of a donated placenta.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: NHSBT/PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Francisco Figueiredo, the consultant ophthalmologist at Newcastle Eye Centre who treated Laskey, said: “Amnion is widely used for a variety of ocular surface problems, and it is incredible to think that this is possible due to the generosity of a mother, donating the organ that she has grown to help grow her child. It really is remarkable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Each donated placenta can be used to make 50-100 amnion grafts, which can also be used to treat burns and other wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Laskey’s assailant, Robbie Scott, had his sentence increased from 10 to 11 years last August after the case was referred to the court of appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And in the mine, the padlocked door represents the first line of defence against another “spillover event” from bats to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The source of Rwanda’s first Marburg outbreak was unclear at first. Officials knew only that patients in Kigali’s main hospitals were falling ill with worrying symptoms and dying, followed by the staff who had cared for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The symptoms of Marburg include fever, rash, chills, head and muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. It can progress to severe and fatal bleeding, but the symptom list overlaps with those of other diseases, including the malaria endemic to the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cb0359a7-e0ed-4dde-b139-40230954cc9c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;By studying medical charts experts were able to trace the origin of the Marburg outbreak to the Gamico Mining site on the outskirts of Kigali.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Rwanda Biomedical Center&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When laboratory tests &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMp2413951?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed Marburg as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;, an outbreak was formally declared on 27 September and public health experts swung into action. A team of clinicians and epidemiologists went back over more than 120 medical charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“They ended up identifying one suspicious case, a 25-year-old female, who was admitted [to an intensive care unit] during the end of August, and who presented with symptoms that are similar to Marburg virus,” says Dr Edson Rwagasore, head of public health surveillance and emergency preparedness and response at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That patient had died – but further investigations revealed that her husband, a 27-year-old miner at the Gamico Mining Ltd site on the western outskirts of Kigali, had been ill at around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We later identified that tunnel 12, where he actually worked, had bats roosting within that tunnel,” says Rwagasore. Further testing identified 14 people who worked in the tunnel with antibodies to Marburg – suggesting previous infection with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It all pointed to this specific site as the initial source of the outbreak, says Rwagasore, speaking at a newly established health clinic at the mine in mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="55881d54-4b84-4760-b1e8-5b3714985d02" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;One of the bricked up entrances preventing access to tunnel 12, where the bat colony roosts.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Kat Lay/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The first scenario was, should we close the mining site? But closing the mining site means people will move to other sites. And then by doing that, we’ll be missing cases, we’ll be missing people who have already been exposed. And then you find yourself spreading beyond just one site,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Instead, miners were allowed to continue work and were screened for Marburg symptoms, while the RBC’s efforts to ensure no further “spillover” began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Tunnel 12 has been all but closed – entry is only allowed for officials carrying out research and surveillance. But the rest of the site is a hive of activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/marburg-virus-disease-origins-reservoirs-transmission-and-guidelines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Marburg virus&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/28/what-is-marburg-virus-symptoms-disease-mvd-cases-causes-treatment-outbreak-ghana-2022" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;viral haemorrhagic fever&lt;/a&gt; that comes from the same family of viruses as Ebola and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/12/lassa-fever-what-are-the-symptoms-and-is-it-easy-to-catch" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Lassa fever&lt;/a&gt;. It was first identified in 1967, after European laboratory workers fell ill after handling biological material from African green monkeys, imported from Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Today, the Egyptian fruit bat – the species found in the Gamico mine – is recognised as the principal animal reservoir for Marburg and similar viruses. The bats don’t appear to get sick themselves, but can shed the virus in their urine, droppings or saliva. If humans or other animals come into contact with those, or with the bats directly, they may become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a bid to prevent fresh outbreaks, Rwanda’s health watchdog has established a new onsite clinic for any miners and their families developing certain symptoms, including fever, at the Kigali mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“With this kind of approach, we are assured that everyone who has symptoms will be identified as soon as possible and then linked to care,” says Rwagasore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But the key intervention is establishing buffer zones “so the human activities are in different places compared to where bats are seen”. The same action is being taken in six other mines with similar risk profiles across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;After donning protective equipment including a hard hat and torch, hi-vis vest, boots and a surgical mask, Rwagasore walks down a road from the mine’s administrative buildings towards the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-22" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Global Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"global-dispatch","successDescription":"Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is also covered by CCTV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Further down the road, tunnel entrances that had been used by miners until last year’s outbreak are completely bricked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Research on the colony’s behaviour is continuing, including plans to put GPS trackers on some of the bats later in February to study their movements. Rwagasore says experts believed they were unlikely to move to other tunnels at the mine, preferring to stay where there is “no disturbance, no noise, nor any kind of interaction”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="88a9b7d7-1ca7-434e-ae7c-0435499b9503" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":27,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are we ready for another pandemic?","elementId":"88a9b7d7-1ca7-434e-ae7c-0435499b9503","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/02/are-we-ready-for-another-pandemic"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;He also hopes it will reduce stress among the bats, “actually also linked to more shedding of the virus”.

"It's important to replace cookware when it starts to show signs of deterioration," says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.unr.edu/public-health/faculty/li-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Li Li;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of public health at the University of Nevada, Reno, and expert in exposure and health sciences. While he admits there's no specific guideline for how often pots or pans should be replaced, "a good rule of thumb is if deep scratches, dents and pitting can be found on cookware surfaces, or if the coating is peeling or flaking, it's time to buy something new."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="commerce"&gt;&lt;div class="mb-8 mt-4"&gt;&lt;p class="grid grid-cols-[auto_1fr] items-center gap-6 text-xl/6 font-bold md:text-2xl after:block after:border-t-4 after:border-batcave dark:after:border-grey-hair"&gt;Quick Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;button class="moreBtn rapid-noclick-resp w-full border-t border-dirty-seagull pt-5 text-center text-sm font-semibold md:pt-7 hover:text-battleship active:text-bob dark:border-charcoal dark:hover:text-[#a49c95] dark:active:text-battleship" data-ylk="elm:loadmore;itc:1;pkgt:square-cta;sec:quick-overview;slk:See 10 more;subsec:commlist;"&gt;See 10 more&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you've found yourself in the market for a new set, it's important to be conscientious about the pots and pans you select to make sure you're adding nontoxic cookware to your kitchen. While new, high-quality cookware sold in major retailers is largely considered safe, it's important to be aware of a few potential risks so you can make the best decision for yourself and your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, Li points out that while the perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) that was once used in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/are-nonstick-pans-safe-what-to-know-210820026.html" data-ylk="slk:Teflon-coated nonstick cookware;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Teflon-coated nonstick cookware &lt;/a&gt;has been phased out due to its &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/human-health-toxicity-assessment-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:links to health concerns;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;links to health concerns&lt;/a&gt;, there are other chemicals in the same family (per- and polyfluoroalkyl stubstances, or PFAS) that are still being used. "We don't yet know whether these other chemicals will turn out to be just as harmful as PFOA in the long run. This is something researchers, including people like me, are still working to figure out," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/krystal-pollitt/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Krystal Pollitt;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Krystal Pollitt&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the Yale School of Public Health, doubles down on the importance of selecting cookware that doesn't contain these other PFAS chemicals. "PFAS are known as 'forever chemicals.' [They] are very difficult to break down and have been linked with chronic disease. Switching to alternatives eliminates exposure to the forever chemicals in the nonstick coatings and [their] associated risk," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your best bet while shopping is to look for cookware that says "PFOA-free" or "PFAS-free." Nonstick cookware also frequently uses a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating which is &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202400326X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:known to be a source of microplastic exposure;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;known to be a source of microplastic exposure&lt;/a&gt; when the nonstick surface is scratched or broken. If you're trying to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/best-non-toxic-kitchen-utensils-221354769.html" data-ylk="slk:cut down on plastics;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;cut down on plastics&lt;/a&gt; to reduce your overall intake, opting for "PTFE-free" cookware or products that don't use this type of nonstick coating can help reduce your risk. Stainless steel, cast iron and ceramic-coated cookware are often considered the best nontoxic cookware options, as these products don't use coatings that contain PFAS or PTFEs. "I have eliminated all nonstick coated cookware and use stainless steel, carbon-steel and cast iron products," says Pollitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, it's still important to be aware that not all metal-based cookware products are created equal. "If you use metal-based cookware, such as stainless steel, aluminum or cast iron, some lower-quality products can contain trace amounts of heavy metals that might leach into the food while cooking. It's best to invest in high-quality products," Li says. He suggests looking for brands marked as FDA-approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To help you find the best nontoxic cookware on the market, we did the research into high-quality options and test-drove nine different cookware sets and a few additional stand-alone pans (made from a variety of materials) to find the best. Here's what we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="best-nontoxic-cookware-sets"&gt;Best nontoxic cookware sets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="best-nontoxic-skillets"&gt;Best nontoxic skillets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you don't need to replace your entire cookware set, but you have a pan or two that have seen better days, you can opt to purchase a single skillet.

If you're opting to switch out some of your other kitchen tools, use the same guidelines on materials to make your selections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-we-chose-the-best-nontoxic-cookware"&gt;How we chose the best nontoxic cookware&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before selecting products to test for this piece, we first read the current research and literature on nontoxic cookware and potentially harmful chemicals that are sometimes included in cookware products. We then consulted two professors of public health with expertise in environmental health and exposure sciences to get their take on safe cookware materials and how to select safer pots and pans. Finally, we researched a wide range of popular cookware brands and products, choosing to personally test nine cookware sets and a few additional individual cookware items. We considered product style, weight, versatility, ease of cooking and cleaning, any special features and most important, any claims or certifications related to the product's safety. We gave special consideration to products with third-party certifications or testing that indicated the product was free of PFOA, PFAS, PTFE or any heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="other-cookware-sets-we-tested"&gt;Other cookware sets we tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hestan Culinary;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d5c3e13a-6c10-467e-be0c-db8f4b54a753&amp;amp;siteId=us-lifestyle&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=22623443-47a8-44f5-94ee-c7f3ede650d6&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=Hestan+Culinary&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlc3RhbmN1bGluYXJ5LmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy90aG9tYXMta2VsbGVyLWluc2lnbmlhL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3Rob21hcy1rZWxsZXItaW5zaWduaWEtNy1waWVjZS1jb29rd2FyZS1zZXQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyNjIzNDQzLTQ3YTgtNDRmNS05NGVlLWM3ZjNlZGU2NTBkNiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9oZXN0YW5jdWxpbmFyeS5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvdGhvbWFzLWtlbGxlci1pbnNpZ25pYS9wcm9kdWN0cy90aG9tYXMta2VsbGVyLWluc2lnbmlhLTctcGllY2UtY29va3dhcmUtc2V0In0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAZlq960FL-sSieTfc5syBM1kNuJS6zCOQMYHp53XXCyZ&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhestanculinary.com%2Fcollections%2Fthomas-keller-insignia%2Fproducts%2Fthomas-keller-insignia-7-piece-cookware-set&amp;amp;refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Flifestyle%2Fthe-best-nontoxic-cookware-for-a-healthier-kitchen-012312084.html" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hestan Thomas Keller Insignia Commercial Clad Stainless-Steel 7-Piece Cookware Set;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hestan Culinary;elmt:;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Hestan Thomas Keller Insignia Commercial Clad Stainless-Steel 7-Piece Cookware Set&lt;/a&gt; ($700): This cookware set has a lot going for it.

Recent headlines have dredged up questions that we are loath to revisit: Where did this new virus come from? How dangerous is it? And how worried should we be? The Globe spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/directory/w/richard-webby.html"&gt;Dr. Richard Webby&lt;/a&gt; at the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, where he’s been studying avian influenza viruses since they first started popping up in people nearly three decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text mv-16 l-inset text-pb-8" data-sophi-feature="interstitial"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ottawa-purchases-500000-doses-of-bird-flu-vaccine-for-people-at-higher/"&gt;Ottawa purchases 500,000 doses of bird flu vaccine for people at higher risk of catching virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The H5N1 story we’re talking about today can really be traced back to as early as 1997. That was the first time this avian influenza sparked human pandemic fears, correct?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Correct. In 1997, in the markets of Hong Kong, over the course of a few months, there were at least 18 people infected, six of those were fatal. In wild aquatic birds, there’s all different shapes and flavours of flu; H5 is just one of them. This was the first time we’d seen H5 in humans but most importantly, it was the first time we’d seen direct bird to human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;People have some familiarity with the term avian influenza but when we start talking Hs and Ns, it can get a bit dizzying for people. Can you explain what these letters refer to?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Influenza viruses only make in the range of 10 to 12 proteins; two of the most important are the H, or hemagglutinin, and N, neuraminidase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;That H protein is what takes the virus and attaches it to the host cell to get it inside. Once the virus particles have been made, [the N protein] helps the new ones get off that cell and head out to infect another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;So really important proteins. All of our vaccines work against targeting that H protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fourteen years ago, you gave an &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/480S4a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;interview&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; with Nature where you said “if there’s anything that keeps us up at night, it’s the H5 virus.” Can you expand on that? What is so worrisome about H5?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Influenza viruses have to actually be activated by host enzymes before they can infect a cell and replicate. Typically most flu viruses are activated by enzymes that live in our respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;But mutations that occur within the H5 and H7 hemagglutinin types allow them to be activated by a much wider range of host enzymes, and some of these enzymes are present outside of the respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;It means that this virus can now replicate outside of the confines of the respiratory tract, get into other organs and cause more systemic infections. So it has the capacity to cause much, much more severe disease than all of the other H subtypes, and the H5 just seems to be able to do that even a little bit better than the H7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;So if there is a virus we don’t want in humans, it’s one of these highly pathogenic H5s. And that is the virus that is circulating in birds and cows around the world now, one of those forms of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s been the biggest “uh-oh” moment for you in this current chapter of the H5N1 story?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The biggest uh-oh is really the introduction of this virus into cows. You pick up a textbook of virology and look at hosts that influenza A viruses can infect – cow’s not on that list. Similarly, dolphins or porpoises – not considered to be a host of influenza. And H5 has come along and infected them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;While H5 is just circulating in birds, there’s not a lot of pressure on that virus to change to be more human infectious. The concern has always been, well, that’s going to change when this virus finds its way into a mammalian host and starts to transmit. It’s going to pick up some of these mammal-adapting changes and that’s going to make it more infectious to humans. Luckily, we’re now a year and a bit into the cow story, and that hasn’t happened. These viruses continue to behave more like avian flu viruses and haven’t adapted to be more infectious for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you give us a sense of the scale of damage this virus has already caused in the animal world?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;It’s been catastrophic. There have been many, many, many hundreds of millions of birds [domestic poultry] that have been mostly depopulated or infected by this virus across the globe in the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;But also this virus came into the Americas into a population of [wild] birds that hadn’t really had much exposure to this version of the flu, right. So they didn’t have much immunity to it, and it roared through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;You think about some of the sea mammal die-offs in South America; tens of thousands of mammals have succumbed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;It’s a worry for humans, but this virus could wipe out some bird species if it got into the wrong places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-COVID, many people can’t bring themselves to consider the possibility of another pandemic. It would help to hear from an expert like yourself, who’s been watching H5N1 for decades now. How concerned are you today about the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;That’s tough. Given everything we know about the virus today, this is a low-risk virus for the general human population. In its current form, this virus is poorly infectious for humans. You’ve got to be exposed to a &lt;i&gt;lot &lt;/i&gt;of virus to be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Of course, this could change tomorrow. There’s a scientific &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that came out from colleagues at the Scripps Institute that suggested that even a single change, a single mutation, in the right place could make the H5 virus switch from binding to birds cells to binding better to human cells. I would’ve probably put my money that it would’ve taken two to three changes to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;So yes; low risk now. But the confidence that it’s going to be low risk in a week’s time is very, very low to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;People now know what it was like to live through a COVID-19 pandemic. If there were an H5N1 pandemic, can we say anything about how it might be different?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Again, we don’t know. But if the H5 virus managed to cause a pandemic, and maintained the ability to cause disease that it has now, I think the H5 would dwarf the COVID pandemic in terms of impact. There would be many, many, many, many more severe infections and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The capacity for this virus to cause disease is really scary. Our group at St. Jude has been essentially following these viruses since 1997 and the current batch of H5s are the nastiest that we have seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;But there’s always the other side of it, and there is some thought that these mutations – that would switch the virus from being a bird virus to being a human virus – might also lessen the ability of the virus to cause severe disease. There could be a trade-off. But we can’t put money on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let’s talk vaccines. Where are we at with H5N1, do we have a vaccine that’s well-matched to this current version of the virus, and how quickly can we get it into people’s arms?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;If you’re looking for any sort of silver lining: In terms of all of these potentially pandemic viruses, we know more about vaccinating against H5 than we do for almost anything else. Because we’ve been worried about it since 1997. So we know what dose to give people, we know how to formulate it, there’s been many, many human clinical trials with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Existing stockpiled vaccine was made against a slightly earlier version of the H5 virus but we’re pretty confident from studies that have been done that it’ll cross-react well to the viruses that are out there now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;So bottom line: we can vaccinate, we know how to make the vaccine, there’s some available now. But more vaccines would have to be made and that does take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Correction__CorrectionWrapper-sc-16rwbja-0 dccrMp mv-16 text-gmr-4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note: &lt;/strong&gt;(Feb. 20, 2025): A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Canada is starting to vaccinate those at highest risk of infection for avian influenza. Canada has only just purchased vaccines and they have not yet been distributed or administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 03:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOSFhjSklTaG5pNjlPcXE4WU9PLTNpdWtxS3lJMlVfc2NKa0tGdFRkb2NDQVdQRk9kcW81WU44Y1kxVXNRWW1BczQwcVFOZC1YclBzTXVOMVBxS0JpXzZ3UWpzcDBQa2tULU1BSnZvU2FKMVAxOEZEQWVnOGY0UXJCdGpLTzJnQ2NsVVUwMWtWMEdBRXRwV24wclJjbmVoVXVCWjlTMS1iVDNiZFptSllrenQ4WUt3T0RqaEE</guid></item><item><title>Man on carnivore diet has cholesterol of 1,000, sees shocking symptom appear on hands - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQZnlVczg5RGNHYi1mNXQzaVdoV2NEZWE4WTU3em1XdkF0dU0xeG1YaG1vTGxyT3hBUUFrd3kxSlVzaVVaNTItX1dSSEh4M0xKOW5IRksxMWFFdHB3M3JyV3o5R01YWmtSdjdaZExKbTd1SkxPS293SEpKdDQ4d2doWksxbnREQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A man who ate “very extreme amounts of fat and protein” as part of the carnivore diet suddenly developed yellow lumps on the palms of his hands — deposits of excess cholesterol under his skin, his doctor says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The unnamed patient, who is in his 40s, was eating up to 6 to 9 pounds of cheese a day, plus sticks of butter and other fat that he would add to his daily hamburgers, says Dr. Kostas Marmagkiolis, an interventional cardiologist at Tampa General Hospital, USF Health and Tampa Heart in Florida, who treated him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tests found the man’s total blood cholesterol was more than 1,000, one of the highest results Marmagkiolis has ever seen. &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthy levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Healthy levels&lt;/a&gt; for adults are less than 200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This patient was not aware that his cholesterol was that high,” Marmagkiolis tells TODAY.com, noting he had a normal cholesterol for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Abruptly within one year, his cholesterol dramatically increased, and at the same time, those lesions appeared.

Once they appear, they generally don’t go away, but can be removed by a dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In this patient’s case, the bumps indicated “an amazing amount of cholesterol in his bloodstream,” the cardiologist notes. In general, such extreme levels are an urgent condition that needs immediate medical attention, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This patient had a total blood cholesterol of more than 1,000, about five times the healthy level for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High cholesterol leads to plaque buildup in the arteries, raising the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol/living-with" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors advised the patient to immediately switch to a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/heart-healthy-foods-rcna122367" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more balanced diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; and take medications to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a carnivore diet healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people are interested in the carnivore diet and other &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-keto-everything-know-about-ketogenic-diet-t217117" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:keto diets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;keto diets&lt;/a&gt; because they feel full while losing weight, Marmagkiolis says. The lack of carbohydrates forces the body to burn fat for energy rather than glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other benefits include eliminating sugar, refined grains and ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to obesity and Type 2 diabetes, Kirkpatrick says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The carnivore diet provides nutrients including riboflavin, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, selenium and vitamin A; but it falls short on magnesium, calcium, vitamin C and fiber, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722875/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People can experience nutrient deficiencies because they're cutting out plant-based foods, which are high in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, Kirkpatrick notes. Not eating enough vegetables can lead to poor gut health and constipation, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, patients who follow such extreme diets are at much higher risk of having abnormal cholesterol levels, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Jeremy London, a Georgia heart surgeon who was not involved in the case report, says the carnivore diet may work for some, but most people will be healthiest when eating a balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our bodies are made to run on proteins, fats and carbohydrates,” London tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Anything in the extreme is rarely going to be beneficial. … In general, if you are focusing on whole foods where you’re eating lean meats, leafy greens, vegetables and fruits and fiber, you’re going to do fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is the healthiest, both doctors say, pointing to studies that show benefits for the heart and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who are still interested in following the carnivore diet should keep an eye on their cholesterol profile with blood work and consult with a dietitian or a physician who can monitor the effects of eating only animal products, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/carnivore-diet-cholesterol-hands-rcna192565" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 02:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQZnlVczg5RGNHYi1mNXQzaVdoV2NEZWE4WTU3em1XdkF0dU0xeG1YaG1vTGxyT3hBUUFrd3kxSlVzaVVaNTItX1dSSEh4M0xKOW5IRksxMWFFdHB3M3JyV3o5R01YWmtSdjdaZExKbTd1SkxPS293SEpKdDQ4d2doWksxbnREQQ</guid></item><item><title>Silent garden killer claims four lives in 'unprecedented' Aussie outbreak - Yahoo News Australia</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNM19sUy04aGFPempkVDBNaWR3OERfUHhxNGZmVi1pamxmNGFfdm5ySkgxT1lXNVlETV90bzZ2ajR4dWQzUUpCam5JSFBOajVpdElZdHBXdUxIR2RyNGJxNV9xOWpQMnFmMUJtUmtoVXVLaUMyd1k5WnkzcGFvRWlTbFhwNUtPQ1ZsQUdkclhReENmSkVjaDdIRk1fMGliYjlUZV9zc0NpSXRCenU1X180MGdn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING — GRAPHIC IMAGES: &lt;/strong&gt;An Aussie city is grappling with an “unprecedented” number of residents contracting a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/silent-garden-killer-puts-aussies-on-high-alert-after-claiming-five-lives-065107584.html" data-ylk="slk:silent yet potentially fatal disease;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;silent yet potentially fatal disease&lt;/a&gt; that has claimed the lives of four people this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since January, 41 cases of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/aussie-dads-warning-after-invisible-killer-pops-up-during-garden-renovation-three-people-died-073327313.html" data-ylk="slk:melioidosis;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;melioidosis&lt;/a&gt; — a serious illness caused by bacteria found lurking in tropical North Australian &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/tagged/gardens/" data-ylk="slk:soils;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;soils&lt;/a&gt; and water — have been recorded in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/qld/" data-ylk="slk:Cairns;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding hinterland region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/tagged/health/" data-ylk="slk:health;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; authorities revealed last week that an investigation was underway after two people had tragically died from the disease, which is commonly associated with heavy rainfall events. The number of fatalities has now doubled, Tropical Public Health Services director Dr Jacqueline Murdoch confirmed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the wet season kicked off in November, almost 60 people have presented to Cairns Hospital with melioidosis, and additional cases have appeared in Townsville, James Cook University microbiologist Jeffrey Warner told Yahoo News Australia. The bacteria is also common in Darwin, but the city has recorded far fewer infections this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Darwin local, Mark, previously told Yahoo he almost lost his life after contracting melioidosis while working in his garden (right) last year.

However, the most serious cases, which can lead to pneumonia and sepsis, occur during severe weather events when people breathe it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mark was forced to have a toe on each foot and part of a finger amputated. Source: Supplied&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are diabetic, consume a lot of alcohol or suffer from a compromised immune system are more at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms, such as a fever, difficulty breathing and coughing, “can start very quickly after exposure to the bacteria but also can be slow, usually on average about nine days but between 1-21 is possible”, the associate professor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this, Cairns may see even more cases before the rain eases off in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="melioidosis-is-on-the-move"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melioidosis is on the move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While melioidosis has been thoroughly studied in the Northern Territory, Warner said in North Queensland, “very rarely” do experts know “exactly where people get the organism from and how they actually get it”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they do know the bacteria — which has also emerged in the state’s south — is on the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found in Townsville that after only about 30mm of rain, there’s enough water to fill dry creek beds and that water is chock a block full of the melioidosis organism,” Warner told Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So as the rain comes, it leeches the organism out of the soil and into water courses. Then the water just takes the organism wherever the course can lead and when we get floods, and those get breached, then the organism gets seeded into the environment more widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If that environment is suitable for the organism to replicate in, it will effectively get planted there and then potentially establish a new focus, which could increase threat to humans in places that it wasn’t previously known to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;How to protect yourself from contracting melioidosis.

The team is also recruiting past or current patients and their families so they can study their immediate surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we do all of those things, we’re going to develop risk assessment maps for North Queensland,” he added.

		&lt;p&gt;EVERETT — Influenza has killed 15 people across Snohomish County during the latest respiratory virus season, the county health department announced on Wednesday, making the 2024-2025 flu season the deadliest in three years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s flu activity is “concerning,” the Snohomish County Health Department said in a release, especially for older people or those with underlying health conditions. In Janurary, the department announced that the flu had killed two people in the county. The 2023-2024 flu season killed 10 people.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen of the people killed by the flu this season were over 50 years old, the department said. One was between 35 and 49 and another was between 20 and 34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 7% of emergency department visits in the past week were related to flu symptoms, the county said. It’s a decrease from the two weeks prior, where flu-related emergency visits hovered around 8%, but still significantly higher than last year’s numbers. Last year peaked at 4%, the department said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last week, 44 people in the county were hospitalized for flu-related illnesses. Last year’s peak was only 13 people. Between 2022 and 2023, the peak was 24 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-34-47221513" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-34-47221513" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“After the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw alarmingly high levels of flu activity in 2022-2023. Now, we are witnessing similar, if not greater, levels of viral transmission. This serves as a clear reminder that everyone in our community should take proactive steps to prevent the spread of illness,” said the Health Officer at the Snohomish County Health Department, James Lewis, in a press release. “One of the most effective measures is vaccination.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are recommended for everybody six months and older. Vaccination, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-safety/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccinesafety.htm" target="_blank"&gt;which research has proven to be extremely safe&lt;/a&gt;, can help prevent severe illness or complications from the flu.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county health department also recommends masking when sick and staying home if you get the flu. People who get the flu should not return to school or work until it has been more than 24 hours since they had a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-35-29963866" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-35-29963866" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly listed the number of people who were killed by the flu during the 2023-2024 season. Ten people died, not seven. It has also been updated to clarify a season peak of 4% of flu-related emergency room visits in the 2023-2024 season.&lt;/em&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The humble mushroom is a fungi with plenty of potential. Previous research has shown mushrooms can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-locate-a-link-between-eating-mushrooms-and-a-lower-risk-of-depression"&gt;reduce depression risk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mushroom-extract-shown-to-dramatically-improve-brain-cell-growth-in-the-lab"&gt;improve brain cell growth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mushroom-extract-shows-promising-effects-against-prostate-cancer"&gt;guard against cancer&lt;/a&gt; – and a new study shows they may protect against  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="152480" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from McGill University in Canada found that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-glucan"&gt;beta-glucan fibers&lt;/a&gt; found in all types of mushrooms could act as a sort of barrier to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="152480" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, limiting inflammation in the lungs of mice exposed to infection after a dose of beta-glucan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the mice given the fibers showed improved lung function and a lower risk of serious illness and death when hit with the flu. Human trials will tell us more, but this is already a promising avenue for researchers to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152483" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152483" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/LungScans.jpg" alt="Lung scans" class="wp-image-152483 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/LungScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/LungScans-600x346.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152483" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mice given beta-glucan showed less lung damage from flu infections. (Khan et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beta-glucan is found in the cell walls of all fungi, including some that live in and on our bodies as part of the human microbiome," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Maziar Divangahi, immunologist at McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is tempting to hypothesize that the levels and composition of fungi in an individual could influence how their immune system responds to infections, in part because of beta-glucan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta-glucan is already known to &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)30587-8"&gt;boost immunity&lt;/a&gt;, but here the researchers wanted to test its capabilities in terms of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerance_to_infections"&gt;disease tolerance&lt;/a&gt; – essentially reducing the impact of the viral attack on the body, rather than killing off the attacking pathogens, as conventional antiviral treatments do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes beta-glucan even more special is that it seems to reprogram immune cells to better cope against the flu. Treated mice had more immune cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil"&gt;neutrophils&lt;/a&gt;, but they were behaving in a more controlled manner than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that reprogramming was crucial, limiting the risk of neutrophils going into overdrive to fight off infection – and leading to the lung inflammation that so often causes complications and serious health issues (like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;) after a flu infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neutrophils are traditionally known for causing inflammation, but beta-glucan has the ability to shift their role to reduce it," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Kim Tran, from McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smarter, savvier neutrophils stuck around for up to a month as well, hinting that a treatment based on beta-glucan could offer long-lasting protection – though we're still in the very early stages of understanding its potential in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we know the benefits of disease tolerance – and how it can save lives – there's a lot we don't know about how it works behind the scenes. This research adds a host of useful insights, and could well be applied to other similar &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/still-short-of-breath-here-are-3-ways-covid-19-can-damage-lungs-long-term"&gt;respiratory diseases&lt;/a&gt; in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is remarkable how beta-glucan can reprogram certain immune cells, such as neutrophils, to control excessive inflammation in the lung," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Nargis Khan, who is now at the University of Calgary in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-024-02041-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Her little whimper, complete with a dramatic huffing and puffing, is adorable!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This video blew up fast with thousands of people begging that Mom take this poor &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/tag/pugs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pug&lt;/a&gt; baby for a Starbies run STAT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Go and get that dog a pup cup now!" one person wrote. "Go to Starbucks and give her that pup cup NOW!" another added, and many more comments stated the same with the majority petitioning "Justice for Chloe!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though the suspense was high, everyone who became invested in the Pug's pup cup status will be relieved to know Mom did take her after the fact. In &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@geemariee__/video/7471021134599703850" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this follow-up video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this follow-up video&lt;/a&gt;, fans can go along for the ride and watch as Chloe forgives Mom as she chows down on her yummy treat. So, everyone—you can rest easy tonight! Chloe's been vindicated!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/pug-mix-contemplating-life-after-stealing-moms-bath-has-zero-regrets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Pug Mix ‘Contemplating Life’ After Stealing Mom’s Bath Has Exactly Zero Regrets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Pug Mix ‘Contemplating Life’ After Stealing Mom’s Bath Has Exactly Zero Regrets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Appeal of Pup-Cups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Anyone with a dog knows the gift a pup cup represents. It's everything a pup could want: sweet, cold, flavorful and most of all—it's not an everyday thing so getting one makes them feel a little more special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Sploot Veterinary Care, &lt;a href="https://www.splootvets.com/post/whats-in-a-pup-cup-famous-pup-cups" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pup cups are fine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pup cups are fine&lt;/a&gt; in moderation and in conjunction with an already healthy diet. Just like with humans, this high-sugar snack should be consumed once in awhile and not an every day event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But that's what makes the lightly flavored whipped topping so exciting! And, though it's not officially a menu iten, in most locations it's free, making it splurge-worthy without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And obviously, if your dog has a sensitive stomach, this wouldn't be the best option. Frozen fruit or a little peanut butter in a Kong would be just as yummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though Starbucks is known for crafting the OG "Puppuccino," many places offer something similar, whether it's a little whipped cream in a cup or even vanilla ice cream. Based on Chloe's utter devastation after realizing she wasn't in line for her coveted treat, pup cups are king.

So we have to assume — based on the history of this patient — that those lesions were directly caused by the high cholesterol, which was directly caused by the type of diet that he was (eating).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The patient developed yellow lumps in the creases of his palms — deposits of excess cholesterol under his skin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For eight months, the man had been following the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/carnivore-diet-meal-plan-rcna127366" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carnivore diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;carnivore diet&lt;/a&gt; — a high-protein, no-carb plan that focuses on eating only animal products, especially meat, eggs and some dairy; and excludes fruits, vegetables and grains. It means eating lots of saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol, registered dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient said he lost weight, had more energy and experienced improved mental clarity, according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2828915" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:case report in JAMA Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;case report in JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;. But his primary care doctor noticed the fatty yellow bumps on his hands and referred him to Marmagkiolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning sign of high cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yellow deposits under the skin are a red flag for cardiologists to check cholesterol levels, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that is a way of the body to eliminate the additional cholesterol from the bloodstream whenever it cannot process it,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bumps appear on eyelids, the most common location, they’re called xanthelasmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;This file image shows xanthelasma on the eyelid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whey they show up on other parts of the body, including hands, elbows and soles of feet, they’re called xanthomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 1% of patients with &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/eating-lower-cholesterol-rcna48052" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; will develop these lumps, with a genetic predisposition playing a role, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yellow deposits themselves are completely painless and harmless — they’re simply a visual signal of a possible metabolic disorder, he adds. Once they appear, they generally don’t go away, but can be removed by a dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this patient’s case, the bumps indicated “an amazing amount of cholesterol in his bloodstream,” the cardiologist notes. In general, such extreme levels are an urgent condition that needs immediate medical attention, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;This patient had a total blood cholesterol of more than 1,000, about five times the healthy level for adults.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol leads to plaque buildup in the arteries, raising the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol/living-with" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors advised the patient to immediately switch to a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/heart-healthy-foods-rcna122367" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more balanced diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; and take medications to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a carnivore diet healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are interested in the carnivore diet and other &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-keto-everything-know-about-ketogenic-diet-t217117" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:keto diets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;keto diets&lt;/a&gt; because they feel full while losing weight, Marmagkiolis says. The lack of carbohydrates forces the body to burn fat for energy rather than glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits include eliminating sugar, refined grains and ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to obesity and Type 2 diabetes, Kirkpatrick says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carnivore diet provides nutrients including riboflavin, zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, selenium and vitamin A; but it falls short on magnesium, calcium, vitamin C and fiber, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722875/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can experience nutrient deficiencies because they're cutting out plant-based foods, which are high in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, Kirkpatrick notes. Not eating enough vegetables can lead to poor gut health and constipation, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, patients who follow such extreme diets are at much higher risk of having abnormal cholesterol levels, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeremy London, a Georgia heart surgeon who was not involved in the case report, says the carnivore diet may work for some, but most people will be healthiest when eating a balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are made to run on proteins, fats and carbohydrates,” London tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything in the extreme is rarely going to be beneficial. … In general, if you are focusing on whole foods where you’re eating lean meats, leafy greens, vegetables and fruits and fiber, you’re going to do fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is the healthiest, both doctors say, pointing to studies that show benefits for the heart and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are still interested in following the carnivore diet should keep an eye on their cholesterol profile with blood work and consult with a dietitian or a physician who can monitor the effects of eating only animal products, Marmagkiolis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/carnivore-diet-cholesterol-hands-rcna192565" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1uMl94MkJValJHcTVRNEZSRkxEa2xRWE9vMXJVQThRa2cyQWd2WVpockFWZ3VCM2xiN0dBTVdvNTEwcWR4THNSMUlKOExXSXNKX19FaDhYcDFhMVJXZmxEd1RfUzNiTGFSN3RRZHBreUJDZHJ6d1E</guid></item><item><title>Trump administration yanks CDC flu vaccine campaign - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOVGxWYWw5NWQ2NjYwdXo4NkFxZDN2Tm1icFJPNjRNQlZjVFQwbG1QRXFtZGZFaV9SX2lTM1cwZ1ZDRnVVRl9uN3hub3Y4NkEtUEtOVmdXdTNXemt1dFZZZlliWkJnRzFlS1kzU2tKUkVRZ01lbWIxemE0SkN5LVhDY0lMLUx0aUc4Y2hVRXpjRWFLUlhXTVlscGc5czdKZmRhY3RnRnJPQkRBT0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is stopping a successful flu vaccination campaign that &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;juxtaposed images of wild animals&lt;/a&gt;, such as a lion, with cute counterparts, like a kitten, as an analogy for how immunization can help tame the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The news was shared with staff during a meeting on Wednesday, according to two CDC staffers who spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, and a recording reviewed by NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During the meeting, leadership at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told&lt;/a&gt; CDC staff the Department of Health and Human Services had reviewed the campaign and advised that it would not continue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move comes during Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first full week on the job as head of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The "Wild to Mild" flu vaccination campaign sought to encourage people to get the flu vaccine. In particular, the campaign aimed to communicate that flu vaccination can lessen symptoms and the chance of getting severely ill, even if it doesn't prevent someone from catching the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's decision to pull the campaign comes in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-05.html" target="_blank"&gt;midst of a brutal flu season&lt;/a&gt; that's still raging. More than 50,000 patients were admitted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospitals for influenza&lt;/a&gt; during the week ending Feb. 8, the highest level in 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Paid media for the ad campaign was ending on Wednesday, according to the current CDC staff member who spoke to NPR. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the "Wild to Mild" vaccination campaign is already offline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Requests for comment to the CDC and HHS were not immediately returned.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The campaign sought to "reset public expectations around what a flu vaccine can do in the event that it does not entirely prevent illness," &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC's webpage describing the launch of the campaign in 2023. It was renewed for the current flu season.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We found that it was very successful—people understood the message, [and] they were swayed by the message," Erin Burns, associate director for communications in the CDC's influenza division, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/cdc-unleashes-wild-mild-campaign-again-ramp-flu-vaccine-rates" target="_blank"&gt;told the trade website&lt;/a&gt; Fierce Pharma in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The campaign was a response to falling flu vaccination rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and targeted groups at higher risk, the CDC's launch webpages said, "especially pregnant women and children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The CDC campaign is a creative and effective way of conveying an extremely important public health message about 'partial protection' vs. 'complete prevention' of disease," Marla Dalton, executive director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told NPR in an email.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it was primarily digital, the campaign also found a home in public transit over the fall. "Wild to Mild" branding was wrapped around trains in four major cities and ads were featured at mass transit stations. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.izsummitpartners.org/content/uploads/CDC-NCIRD_Flu-Campaign_NIVW-Slides.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;presentation from CDC&lt;/a&gt; in November, those ads reached more than 30 million riders and generated another 30 million digital impressions by the end of October last year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear how much time was left in the campaign, but it would have at least gone through the end of this flu season and the materials would have stayed on the agency's website, one of the CDC staffers told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes at federal health agencies?

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine in Seattle conducted a deep dive of the Global Burden of Disease data by region, country, year, age, sex, and suicide by firearms from 1990 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last three decades, the global age-standardized mortality rate for suicide declined by nearly 40%, from about 15 deaths per 100,000 to 9 deaths per 100,000, indicating that intervention and prevention are working. For females, the rate declined by more than 50%, while it declined by almost 34% for males. Regionally, East Asia recorded the largest decline of 66% with China reporting the largest decline in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the progress is encouraging, it's not universal. Four regions reported increases in the suicide rate for both sexes combined during the same period. Central Latin America had the highest jump at 39%, with Mexico at the top of the region's list with a 123% increase for females alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andean Latin America had the second highest increase of 13%, with Ecuador recording the largest rise for both sexes combined in the region. Tropical Latin America was third with a 9% increase, and Paraguay was at the top of the region's list for both sexes combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-income North America registered a 7% increase, with the U.S. at the top of the region's list with a 23% jump for females alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 2021 global causes of death, suicide was ranked 21st (higher than HIV/AIDS) for both sexes combined. Regionally, the highest mortality rates from suicide were in Eastern Europe, Southern sub-Saharan Africa, and Central sub-Saharan Africa. For males, suicide was the 19th-leading cause of death globally, with Eastern Europe recording the highest death rate. For females, suicide was ranked 27th globally, with South Asia having the highest rate for females.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"While the progress made in declining &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/suicide+rates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;suicide rates&lt;/a&gt; is encouraging, it is clear that suicide continues to impact some countries and populations more than others. Removing suicide stigma and barriers to access mental health support systems remain critical measures, particularly among people with mental and substance abuse disorders," said senior author Dr. Mohsen Naghavi with IHME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies found that victims of violence, sexual assault, and childhood trauma are observed to be at increased risk for suicide. Research has consistently shown that access to lethal means, such as guns and pesticide, is associated with higher rates of suicides. Prior evidence suggests that poverty and social deprivation are also associated with suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest numbers also underscore a grim difference between males and females globally, regionally, and nationally. Males were more than twice as likely to die from suicide than females, but females were 49% more likely to attempt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, every minute, four men and six women needed inpatient treatment due to suicide attempts. Overall, the mortality rate for suicide was 12.8 per 100,000 population for males and 5.4 per 100,000 population for females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidence of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/suicide+attempts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;suicide attempts&lt;/a&gt; requiring &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical care&lt;/a&gt; that did not result in death was three times higher for females compared to males. This difference was highest in high-income North America, with one in 30.7 attempts resulting in death for females and one in 6.3 attempts resulting in death for males.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Globally, males were more than three times as likely to die by suicide using firearms than females: 10% of suicides by males were with guns, while 3% of suicides by females were with guns. The U.S. had the highest firearm-related suicides in the world: nearly 22,000 or 55% of suicides by males were with guns, while more than 3,000 or nearly 31% of suicides by females were with guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Men tend to choose more violent and lethal methods of suicide such as guns, while women are more likely to choose less fatal means such as poisoning and overdosing, which have a higher survival rate," said Emily Rosenblad, the study's second author and project officer at IHME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both males and females globally are dying by suicide later in life. In 1990, the average age at death for males was 43 years, and for females it was almost 42 years. By 2021, the average age at death had climbed to 47 for males and nearly 47 for females. The highest mean age was about 58 years for males and 60 years for females, both in East Asia. Conversely, the youngest average age at suicide was found in Oceania, where it was 36 years for males and 34 years for females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study identifies the existing patterns and trends to develop more effective suicide prevention methods around the world, which can help policymakers and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+workers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; develop better-customized strategies and approaches for specific locations and populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suicide prevention is most effective when communities work together through awareness, intervention, and support systems.&lt;/p&gt;

The spending likely reflects populations who are proactive about seeking medical care when they’re feeling ill and have the insurance or money to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CNCEFMZPCNHJHD7GUPYA42QM6E"&gt;That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2024.26790" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; on U.S. health care spending released last week by researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2830568?guestAccessKey=783582d7-4e27-4a8c-8b5a-ecebb4c21894&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=021425" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2830568?guestAccessKey=783582d7-4e27-4a8c-8b5a-ecebb4c21894&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=021425"&gt;published in the Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from over 3,000 counties in the U.S., tallying variations in spending and the different types of people accessed from coast to coast between 2010 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V5MBQYHFYZEVPKRRAR4LXNKVMQ"&gt;The research tracked payments for 148 health conditions by examining more than 40 billion insurance claims — from Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans — and 1 billion facility records to produce what they say is the most comprehensive study on U.S. health care spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3JCGTIKWKJDNTH2ICKOJ7MTUGY"&gt;The UW studies emerge at a time when consumers are grappling with increasing medical costs. A recent report by &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/behind-the-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;consulting firm PwC&lt;/a&gt; projects that consumers this year will see the highest increase in health care costs in 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AD7AYFZZGVFTRLNRRFNBA7YUUA"&gt;The University of Washington report found Oregon spent $30.3 billion on health care in 2019, roughly $7 billion more than in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HO7L274TUZGQJIDVHFKA2DSTVI"&gt;The total includes spending from all sources — patients, insurance and government programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI" data-fusion-component="CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rawhtml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI" data-fusion-component="CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LGN5WIUBERCQTJS6WBKJXJQPQ4"&gt;On a per-person basis, health care spending in Oregon rose from $5,888 in 2010 to $7,205 in 2019, a 22% increase. This growth outpaced the national growth rate of 16% during the same period. However, despite the faster growth, Oregon still spent less on health care per person by the dollar amount than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Health care spending varies across Oregon counties&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I63XWAXR2NATRLLHBQXQUWB5XA"&gt;The study revealed significant disparities in health care spending at the county level. Even after adjusting for factors like age and health conditions, people in some Oregon counties spent considerably more than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VUHGEMSIJZEMLOHRYPKI23R57M"&gt;According to researchers, this suggests that differences in health care costs aren’t just due to populations being older or sicker but may also stem from factors like how often people use health services, local pricing and access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU" data-fusion-component="3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU" data-fusion-component="3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PRCMLUAZDNHKFO6KMG5OHDWGH4"&gt;The counties with the highest health care spending per capita were likely linked to more residents being proactive about their health and seeking medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P72YIXMUAJAVDHR6GMIAGPHN34"&gt;For instance, Clackamas and Deschutes counties led the state in ambulatory care visits, which include primary care, outpatient specialty services, urgent care, and rehabilitation programs. Not only did residents in these counties seek medical care more often, but they also had the highest per-person spending on physician and outpatient services in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UOOMX3MOSZFCJEJFVTJJJUFJ64"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Wheeler and Umatilla counties spent the least on health care per person in 2019 — $5,455 and $5,959, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NOXFIUHWMNAKZGJGPGF2M7TX3U"&gt;Neither ranks among Oregon’s wealthiest regions. Wheeler County has a median household income of $40,926 — making it the state’s third-poorest county — and also has one of Oregon’s oldest populations, with a median age of 59. Despite this, residents of Wheeler County visited the doctor less often than any other county in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HTPQKZACTZDKLOX3B2CJUOAVQY"&gt;Meanwhile, Umatilla County has a median household income of $56,700, below the statewide median of $62,818. With a median age of 36.5 years, Umatilla is one of Oregon’s youngest counties, which may help explain why residents generally used fewer health care services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GXH4WJZM55DRXF4SI4AJ5JJFS4"&gt;“Just because some counties in Oregon spend more than other counties in the state does not mean that there’s fundamentally a problem,” said Dr. Joseph Dieleman, an associate professor at the University of Washington and lead author of the study. He said there are a number of reasons why people in some counties are spending more on health care than in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4ILUOQ4X55HCFMYEH75LV7KB5A"&gt;One major factor is the cost of living.

A recent report by &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/behind-the-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;consulting firm PwC&lt;/a&gt; projects that consumers this year will see the highest increase in health care costs in 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AD7AYFZZGVFTRLNRRFNBA7YUUA"&gt;The University of Washington report found Oregon spent $30.3 billion on health care in 2019, roughly $7 billion more than in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HO7L274TUZGQJIDVHFKA2DSTVI"&gt;The total includes spending from all sources — patients, insurance and government programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI" data-fusion-component="CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rawhtml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI" data-fusion-component="CNCD36RTBFBPFMVJ7HN3BWB4KI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LGN5WIUBERCQTJS6WBKJXJQPQ4"&gt;On a per-person basis, health care spending in Oregon rose from $5,888 in 2010 to $7,205 in 2019, a 22% increase. This growth outpaced the national growth rate of 16% during the same period. However, despite the faster growth, Oregon still spent less on health care per person by the dollar amount than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Health care spending varies across Oregon counties&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I63XWAXR2NATRLLHBQXQUWB5XA"&gt;The study revealed significant disparities in health care spending at the county level. Even after adjusting for factors like age and health conditions, people in some Oregon counties spent considerably more than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VUHGEMSIJZEMLOHRYPKI23R57M"&gt;According to researchers, this suggests that differences in health care costs aren’t just due to populations being older or sicker but may also stem from factors like how often people use health services, local pricing and access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU" data-fusion-component="3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU" data-fusion-component="3NNIBCKQ2JG6ZKJVZRXGJ6XIAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PRCMLUAZDNHKFO6KMG5OHDWGH4"&gt;The counties with the highest health care spending per capita were likely linked to more residents being proactive about their health and seeking medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P72YIXMUAJAVDHR6GMIAGPHN34"&gt;For instance, Clackamas and Deschutes counties led the state in ambulatory care visits, which include primary care, outpatient specialty services, urgent care, and rehabilitation programs. Not only did residents in these counties seek medical care more often, but they also had the highest per-person spending on physician and outpatient services in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UOOMX3MOSZFCJEJFVTJJJUFJ64"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Wheeler and Umatilla counties spent the least on health care per person in 2019 — $5,455 and $5,959, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NOXFIUHWMNAKZGJGPGF2M7TX3U"&gt;Neither ranks among Oregon’s wealthiest regions. Wheeler County has a median household income of $40,926 — making it the state’s third-poorest county — and also has one of Oregon’s oldest populations, with a median age of 59. Despite this, residents of Wheeler County visited the doctor less often than any other county in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HTPQKZACTZDKLOX3B2CJUOAVQY"&gt;Meanwhile, Umatilla County has a median household income of $56,700, below the statewide median of $62,818. With a median age of 36.5 years, Umatilla is one of Oregon’s youngest counties, which may help explain why residents generally used fewer health care services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GXH4WJZM55DRXF4SI4AJ5JJFS4"&gt;“Just because some counties in Oregon spend more than other counties in the state does not mean that there’s fundamentally a problem,” said Dr. Joseph Dieleman, an associate professor at the University of Washington and lead author of the study. He said there are a number of reasons why people in some counties are spending more on health care than in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4ILUOQ4X55HCFMYEH75LV7KB5A"&gt;One major factor is the cost of living. Dieleman said health care services tend to be more expensive in areas where general living expenses are higher.

Yet, data shows that the bulk of the state’s health care dollars that year went toward treating oral disorders, musculoskeletal disorders and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T7FTUS2AWVEU7GSAQWK6THEUQE"&gt;While this does not necessarily mean that too much is being spent on dental care, the findings raise questions about whether overall health care spending is closely aligned with the population’s greatest medical needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="US3SZLSECJB6HN6DT4QLWIWXJY"&gt;“Some of the variation in spending is really unexplained and kind of mysterious,” he said. “It raises more questions and warrants further analysis to find out why that exists. There’s so much variation in utilization—it suggests that some places may not be getting enough care, while others might be getting more than they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XVTR7BKP5ZF5XIJCDPIXWF7NIA"&gt;--&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/staff/kristinedeleon/posts.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Kristine de Leon&lt;/a&gt; covers consumer health, small business and data enterprise stories.

&lt;p&gt;Deaths of millions of laying hens imperil President Donald Trump’s pledge to bring down everyday costs, as grocery stores ration supplies and restaurants raise prices for egg dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipments to the U.S. from Turkey began this month and will continue until July, said Ibrahim Afyon, chairman of the Egg Producers Central Union in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The export will take place through our member companies with the required authorizations, while two firms will coordinate the process,” Afyon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A total of 15,000 tonnes of eggs — equivalent to 700 containers — will be shipped,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has been working to contain bird flu, which was first detected in dairy cattle in Texas last March and has since spread to more than 970 herds in 17 states. The virus has infected nearly 70 people since April, primarily farm workers exposed to infected poultry or cattle. One person who was infected died.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in poultry began in 2022 and has wiped out about 162 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, according to U.S. data. A surge in recent infections is fuelling egg shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We support the temporary import of egg products to help ease the strain on the U.S. egg supply,” said Chad Gregory, CEO of United Egg Producers, a cooperative that represents U.S. egg farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with supply constraints, U.S. companies have sought alternative import markets, leading to negotiations with Turkish producers, Afyon said. The deal is expected to generate around $26 million in export revenue, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey ranks among the world’s top 10 egg exporters, Afyon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture had no comment on imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is rebuilding a stockpile of bird flu vaccines for poultry and granted a conditional license to animal health company Zoetis for a vaccine for chickens. USDA has not yet authorized the use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"Our readiness with this most recent vaccine is another example of how we continue to live our purpose to nurture the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, ultimately providing solutions to global animal health challenges," Mahesh Kumar, senior VP for global biologics R&amp;amp;D at Zoetis, says in the release. USDA regulators must give a final OK to the vaccine before poultry farmers can start administering it.  (More &lt;a href="/tag/14230/1/h5n1.html"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; stories.)

This process, called the Attention, Arousal, and Release Spiral, creates a cycle where focused attention leads to joy, making concentration effortless and deepening the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gathered firsthand accounts from meditation retreats and worship services, analyzing the micro-moments of attention and emotional shifts. Preliminary brain activity findings suggest both practices involve a cognitive shift that enhances immersion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this shared mechanism could help more people access profound states of focus and tranquility.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, co-led by Michael Lifshitz, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at McGill University and Investigator at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, with collaborators from Monash University and the University of Toronto, identified a phenomenon they call the Attention, Arousal and Release Spiral – a mental cycle that deepens both meditative and energized states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Human Biology,&lt;/em&gt; offers new insights into how humans can cultivate deep states of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can understand this process better, we may be able to help more people access deep states of tranquility and bliss for themselves,” said Lifshitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In another sense, our findings may help to promote a sense of commonality and mutual respect between spiritual traditions. Despite differences in beliefs, we are all sharing a human experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common pathway to bliss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that both jhāna meditators and those speaking in tongues enter a reinforcing cycle: they focus their attention on an object, such as the breath in meditation or God in prayer, which triggers a sense of joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This joy makes attention feel effortless, leading to a feeling of surrender, which deepens the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, this spiralling dynamic leading to increasingly deep and effortless bliss is a novel idea in the psychological sciences,” said Lifshitz. “It’s fascinating that these radically different spiritual traditions seem to have discovered it and made use of it in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover this link, researchers collected firsthand accounts from Buddhist meditation retreats and evangelical Christian worship services in the U.S. They asked participants to describe the subtle micro-moments of their attention and emotional state during their practice. They also recorded the practitioners’ brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While full neurobiological results are still being analyzed, early findings suggest that both practices involve a cognitive shift that allows for a uniquely immersive experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step involves using brain imaging techniques to map the physiological changes that occur as attention, arousal and release unfold in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Spiral of Attention, Arousal, and Release: A Comparative Phenomenology of Jhāna Meditation and Speaking in Tongues” by Josh Brahinsky, Jonas Mago, Mark Miller, Shaila Catherine and Michael Lifshitz&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;was published in &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Human Biology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Templeton Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotheology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#305b55595c511e545540514055705d5357595c5c1e5351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

While the disease is rare and has the potential to be severe, its simple prevention is something that we have incorporated into our daily lives; the reality is far less alarming when placed in a good context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-most-cases-of-rat-lungworm-are-preventable-with-basic-food-safety"&gt;Most cases of rat lungworm are preventable with basic food safety.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Travelers can continue to enjoy Hawaii’s beauty and cuisine without unnecessary concern by understanding how the disease spreads and then taking the simple steps that significantly reduce exposure. That’s what we and other Hawaii residents have done since this first came to our attention years ago. Taking these small steps ensures you can safely enjoy Hawaii’s diverse produce and culinary offerings without much concern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thoroughly-inspect-and-wash-produce-thoroughly"&gt;Thoroughly inspect and wash produce thoroughly. &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This simple step removes snails, slugs, and their slime from produce. It’s especially important for locally grown leafy greens like lettuce, basil, and kale, whether bought from farmers’ markets, roadside stands or stores. For residents, this becomes second nature—starting with checking for signs of slug or snail damage. Visitors should adopt the same habit for added safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rat-lungworm-disease-angiostrongyliasis-is-a-parasitic-infection"&gt;Rat lungworm disease (angiostrongyliasis) is a parasitic infection.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The parasite’s life cycle begins in rats, with snails and slugs acting as intermediate hosts. Humans become infected when they accidentally consume raw or undercooked snails, slugs, &lt;span&gt;or perhaps most importantly to visitors, products that have been contaminated with droppings and slime&lt;/span&gt;. The disease is neither transmitted between humans nor linked to ocean waters or casual exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-symptoms-of-rat-lungworm-disease-range-from-mild-to-severe"&gt;The symptoms of rat lungworm disease range from mild to severe.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early signs often include nausea, headaches, stomach pain, and fatigue. However, neurological symptoms such as tingling sensations, burning pain, and neck stiffness can develop in rare and severe cases that may lead to meningitis. While there is no direct cure, doctors treat patients by managing symptoms with pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, the disease is rare in Hawaii, with annual cases averaging up to a dozen across all islands. While the condition is monitored closely, officials emphasize that the risk remains low, especially for those who take proper precautions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-hawaii-affected"&gt;Why is Hawaii affected?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s lush, tropical environment creates ideal conditions for hosts like snails and slugs to thrive. This makes the islands well suited to outbreaks compared to more temperate regions. However, even in Hawaii, most cases can be traced back to specific exposures involving unwashed produce or raw food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Big Island has historically reported the highest number of cases, though instances have also been documented on other islands, including Maui, Kauai, and Oahu. Leafy greens, especially those from home gardens or farmers markets, are sometimes linked to transmission when thorough washing is overlooked. Despite this, people consume fresh produce in Hawaii every year without ever having an issue issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii’s Department of Health actively monitors rat lungworm disease and keeps the public informed. Thanks to ongoing education efforts and heightened awareness, especially among residents (and now hopefully visitors), cases have remained consistently low relative to the population.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Recent headlines have overstated rat lungworm disease. It is being overhyped as an urgent and widespread threat, which is not the case. This portrayal lacks the understanding of the actual risks. Some stories imply that anyone visiting Hawaii is automatically at risk; this is not true. The disease is not airborne and cannot be contracted from casual contact or activities like swimming, hiking, or enjoying outdoor spaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another typical exaggeration is that all foods in Hawaii, especially local produce, are dangerous to eat. This claim is not supported by evidence. While unwashed greens can carry risks, most restaurants, grocery stores, and markets in Hawaii adhere to strict safety standards, making their produce safe for consumption. Visitors who practice basic food hygiene virtually eliminate their exposure to the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports also tend to highlight extreme cases, focusing almost entirely on severe symptoms and long-term complications. While these outcomes are possible, they represent a minority of cases. The majority of infections involve mild symptoms that resolve with appropriate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-do-if-you-suspect-exposure"&gt;What to do if you suspect exposure.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those worried about potential exposure, staying calm and monitoring for symptoms is key. Contacting a medical professional early is vital if symptoms like persistent headaches, tingling sensations, or neck stiffness develop. Hawaii’s healthcare providers are experienced in identifying and treating rat lungworm disease, and they can offer tailored care to address individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though cases are rare, local health systems are prepared to manage the disease effectively. Many cases involve mild symptoms and resolve easily without long-term issues when caught and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-look-at-historical-perspectives"&gt;A look at historical perspectives.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii has dealt with rat lungworm disease for decades, yet the highest-reported cases remain in the single digits annually per island. Historical events, such as cluster cases, sparked essential changes in how the community approaches food safety. Increased public health campaigns and inspections of farm produce have become standard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Farmers, retailers, and residents alike have embraced best practices like cleaning produce more thoroughly before it reaches consumers. These efforts ensure that most locally grown produce is entirely safe to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enjoying-hawaii-without-any-unnecessary-worry"&gt;Enjoying Hawaii without any unnecessary worry.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawaii offers an unmatched experience filled with vibrant farmers markets, unparalleled landscapes, and fresh, local food. With basic precautions, visitors can enjoy these highlights without worrying about rat lungworm disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Washing produce, keeping an eye out for snail damage, droppings and slime, avoiding raw, risky foods, and staying informed are all simple steps to minimize an already low risk further. By focusing on practical safety measures rather than sensationalized fears, travelers can confidently explore the islands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rat lungworm disease is a rare but real health issue in Hawaii that can be approached with confidence and good practices. While media reports like this may overstate the risks, the danger is small and preventable. Awareness, not fear, is the best way to address this concern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We welcome your comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is because pre-cancerous polyps can be caught and removed when you get your recommended colonoscopies. Screening isn’t the only way to prevent colon cancer, though. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some research has suggested that shifting your routine can help you lower your risk—whether that means enjoying &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colorectal-cancer-milk-study-8775172" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a glass of milk&lt;/a&gt; or aiming for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/inflammation-colon-cancer-study-8761229" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods and habits&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies have suggested that yogurt, in particular, may offer protection against colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Eating yogurt and the bacteria it contains can improve the health of the gut and the health of the gut lining,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sarah-pflugradt-8655704" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Sarah Pflugradt, Ph.D., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a performance nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://sarahpflugradt.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Pflugradt Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “Adding good bacteria to the gut can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can help lower inflammation and have an antioxidant effect, and this can impact the development of cancer.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of these beneficial bacteria is called &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;. If it looks familiar to you, it might be because you’ve seen it listed on your yogurt container. It’s one of the gut-friendly bacteria used to make yogurt and one that researchers believe may help prevent colon cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Brigham and Women’s, a Harvard teaching hospital in Boston, took a closer look at colon tumors in people who have regularly eaten yogurt for many years. Their findings are published in the February 2025 issue of &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from two long-term U.S. studies: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS; started in 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; started in 1986). For this study, researchers included 87,379 women from the NHS and 44,677 men from the HPFS for a total of 132,056 participants. Baseline data was gathered and updated every two years to collect data on demographics, lifestyle factors, medical history and disease outcomes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For both the NHS and HPFS, dietary information was gathered at baseline and updated about every 4 years. For this study, researchers categorized participants based on their yogurt intake: &amp;lt;1 serving/month, 1-3 servings/month, 1 serving/week and ≥2 servings/week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each participant was followed until 2016, a colon cancer diagnosis or death, whichever came first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those participants with a colon cancer diagnosis, researchers wanted to know how much, if any, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;was found in their cancer tumors, and if there was an association between yogurt consumption and the type of tumors. This meant they were going deeper than just an overall association between yogurt consumption and colon cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There ended up being a total of 3,079 colon cases during the study period. Among those, 346 (31%) were &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium-&lt;/em&gt;positive cases, and 775 (69%) were &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium-&lt;/em&gt;negative cases. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re feeling confused, that’s understandable. After all, if &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;is supposed to help prevent colon cancer, why was it found in 31% of the colon cancer cases? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers don’t have a final answer on that yet, but they surmise that &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;in colon cancer tumors may be there to help fight the cancer. They also say that &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive colon tumors may suggest impaired intestinal barrier function. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-leaky-gut-syndrome-8421526" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leaky gut syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve heard of the intestinal barrier. At its healthiest, your intestinal barrier is a selectively permeable wall that allows your gut to absorb nutrients but keep in bacteria and undigested food particles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If it’s not functioning properly, toxins and other substances may be able to cross the barrier—which could explain how &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;enters the cancer tumor.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And since the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-negative tumors appeared twice as often as the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive ones, the study authors propose that yogurt intake may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer when your intestinal barrier is disrupted. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this study, participants reporting higher yogurt intake were also more likely to have higher intakes of total folate, calcium and vitamin D, plus they were more regularly screened with colonoscopies, were more physically active and were less likely to smoke or consume processed and red meat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All of these behaviors are linked to a lower risk of colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So not only did they eat plenty of yogurt, but they also tended to engage in overall healthy habits. This stresses the importance of taking a big-picture view of your health habits. While some foods and behaviors help reduce the risk of disease, there is no one magic potion, food or behavior that completely erases the risk of anything. It’s a collaborative effort that involves every area of your life.     
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that higher yogurt intake is associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. In particular, it appears to protect against &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive colon cancer tumors. This is likely due to having more beneficial gut bacteria, which help protect the colon. Other fermented foods that add helpful bacteria to your gut include kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since bacteria need to eat to thrive, be sure to also include plenty of high-fiber foods—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. Limit or avoid red meat and processed meats, ultra-processed foods and foods and beverages with a lot of added sugar. And keeping your whole health in mind, move more often, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-6-hours-of-sleep-enough-8692438" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;get plenty of quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, manage your stressors and spend quality time with family and friends. In doing so, you’ll not only reduce your risk of disease—including colon cancer—but you’ll also improve your quality of life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;A cold, also known as the common cold, is a viral infection of your nose and throat. It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common culprits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the symptoms of a cold include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, slight body aches, sneezing, and low-grade fever. These symptoms usually last for about a week to 10 days. However, if your cold symptoms persist for more than two weeks, it could be a sign of a more serious condition like a sinus infection or another respiratory illness, and it’s advisable to consult a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cold-sickness-health-care_l_63d80e3ce4b0c8e3fc7fdd4f"&gt;HuffPost Life&lt;/a&gt;, first test to make sure your cold symptoms are not a sign of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or influenza. These infections spread in similar ways and have common overlapping symptoms. You can use at-home tests to detect these illnesses or go to your healthcare provider for the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your cold symptoms seem to be getting worse, this may mean something else is going on. Shortness of breath, wheezing or chest pain aren’t usually associated with a cold and may signal pneumonia, asthma or even a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say that while colds are caused by viruses, a lingering illness signals that you may have developed a bacterial infection like sinusitis. Symptoms include a phlegmy cough, facial pain or swelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marwan Azar, an infectious disease expert at Yale Medicine says that ongoing cold symptoms such as a recurring cough or an irritated throat that lasts more than two weeks could also be due to persistent inflammation caused by an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts also warn that if you don’t give your body enough time to rest and recover from your cold, it may linger longer. Make sure you are adequately resting, hydrating and getting enough sleep. If you are treating your cold correctly and symptoms continue after three weeks, seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;

From multivitamins to calcium and fish oil, you can easily find OTC supplements in nearby stores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;58% of U.S. adults take dietary supplements, including 64% of women and 51% of men, according to the 2017–18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A 2024 poll suggests that 75% of adults take supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; points out that drug-induced acute live failure tied to herbal and dietary supplements had increased eightfold from 1995 through 2020. The herbal and dietary supplements contribute to roughly 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide, according to 2017 research published in the journal Hepatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean you should toss away your multivitamin stash and other dietary supplements? However, it is important to know what you are incorporating into your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan noted last year that 15.6 million Americans consume products containing at least one of these six botanicals linked to liver damage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garcinia cambogia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red yeast rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black cohosh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a previous study, we found that there was a great deal of mislabeling of some of these products. We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50% mismatch between the stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming. If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it’s basically a coin flip if that’s true or not,” senior author Dr. Robert Fontana, a Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We weren't aware that so many people were taking these supplements. So, when doctors see patients in the office, they don't necessarily ask about supplement use or take into consideration their effects," Likhitsup, who's also a transplant hepatologist adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies also suggested that toxic heavy metal contamination was found in some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-supplements-to-avoid-if-you-want-to-live-longer/articleshow/117403418.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplements.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the FDA regulates supplements, the federal agency does not review them for safety, quality, and effectiveness. The FDA regulates them as food, not drugs. So, it is up to the manufacturers to properly label their products, and then the FDA reviews after they hit the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to stop your nails from breaking often&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to stay safe is to communicate with your healthcare providers about the supplements you are taking. Also, don’t fall for ‘megadosing’ trends for speedy results. The Office of Dietary Supplements, part of the National Institutes of Health, has established daily upper limits (ULs) for safe consumption. For instance, adults shouldn’t consume more than 100 micrograms of vitamin D in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 21:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8wFBVV95cUxObXVBeW9uVUdNRTNQWmptbmhVcGpiMmw0Y1ZZNTJhd052YllqYWVCWGNzaU9RQnJHZHhrY0tqZ1NNa3BYUlk0SG1sWTFJZmV6SXFRZExfdlhYUGwwdVZJdGJvZDJPYWJxTHVwdTVFUFlhSlpnZ1NOOXFTUEs1X0NlNndDc2VOdVZPcF9NNVBTWlpDOTBVRFRBWnBzcjZkdmdPdlB4cjRsMWlNSGxDdTNjNVhCbnBycGI3UEhFQnVzeDlWUXdTMjdobmt1aTFFWFV5T0dVMDE2NVpxam5vVnd1TnFRaklidHdIalgxREl5cTVCYmM</guid></item><item><title>Muscle-building supplements may put teens at risk for a body image disorder, study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPcV9wYkkwOENUWDBaNHluM2F1SVBHaklZUWE2U0xpaVdJcng0c3UyUnljTkFsREk3NDhwRUZmWFFBVjhvOG1TMzVqMmJ2NHBRcXJzWVhnR1NaUmY0OXkyS2hOOUpNU2ZPVWk4enRuZWh0dm1IMy1RZ3c3a2dpSG5lbEoyNjFENTViak04U3hNTUo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Protein shakes, pre-workout mixes and other supplements aren’t always just a part of a gym routine. In adolescents and young adults, they could be connected to a body image disorder that exhibits a pathological focus on muscle development and leanness, according to new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00083b6mmy8v4gdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The use of 6 different dietary supplements intended for muscle building was associated with greater symptoms of muscle dysmorphia,” said lead study author&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto, via email. “This included whey protein powder and creatine, both of which are commonly used among young people trying to gain muscle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00093b6my41c50oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The association was especially strong with supplements for gaining weight or mass, and the symptoms, such as excessive gym time and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;obsessing over food intake, increased as the number of supplements used grew, according to a new study published Wednesday in journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000a3b6m7rs1i68f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study team analyzed data from 2,731 participants ages 16 to 30 of the &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/canadian-study-of-adolescent-health-behaviors/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to gather information on disordered eating, muscle-building behavior, body image and social health. The researchers analyzed the participants’ reports of supplement use against their symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, which were assessed using &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6239320/" target="_blank"&gt;the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory&lt;/a&gt;, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000b3b6m7ohuv0tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study is observational, meaning it’s hard to say whether the use of supplements increased the symptoms of muscle dysmorphia or if people with more muscle dysmorphia symptoms were more likely to take more supplements, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College. Saltz was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000c3b6muchf6voc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study shows that younger people who may not use &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/health/bodybuilding-steroids-testicular-damage-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt;, which have been found to be harmful, might still be using other substances to treat their muscle dysmorphia, and the public needs to be more aware, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000d3b6ma8k7k6jw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people think supplements are safe because it’s just a supplement,” she said. “But in fact, that is not always the case.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000e3b6mzskzpowv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is a subset of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/body-dysmorphia/" target="_blank"&gt;body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/a&gt;, in which an individual is preoccupied with an imagined defect in their appearance, Saltz said. Those with muscle dysmorphia believe their body should be leaner and more muscular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000f3b6mcd5cdslm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who experience muscle dysmorphia often have significant challenges in their social lives, and can experience severe emotional distress,” Ganson said. “Not to mention, these individuals may go to extreme lengths to achieve their body ideal, such as using anabolic steroids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000g3b6m8n168aan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it isn’t just a matter of lowered confidence, Saltz said. Even if people with this disorder reach the ideal image they are striving for, it doesn’t fix the distress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000h3b6m7g1lp4yw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When they look in the mirror, they don’t see what you see when you look at them,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000i3b6mp7ackz6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other warning signs include having a rigid exercise routine, experiencing emotional distress, and facing difficulty completing expectations such as school and work, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000j3b6m76ll636f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You might also see people with muscle dysmorphic disorder avoiding socially normal body exposure — such as removing their shirts at the beach — or missing social gatherings because of feelings around their appearance, Saltz added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000k3b6mhl1vi4x7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using supplements to change a body’s appearance is common.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000l3b6mc29l0v1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While 2.2% of young adult males report using steroids, 36.3% report using protein powders and shakes, while 10.1% said they use other muscle-building substances such as creatine and growth hormones, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101778" target="_blank"&gt;a June 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000m3b6mllgt6myx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most supplements are readily available with little to no regulation, and “studies analyzing these products have found that many are mislabeled and are tainted with harmful substances like anabolic steroids,” said study coauthor Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000n3b6mj1e8cbcu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration does monitor adverse health impacts and occasionally inspects manufacturing facilities. However, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the agency does not have jurisdiction to approve dietary supplements before they enter the public marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000o3b6m2ss7xcni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are also few studies on supplements’ safety and efficacy, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000p3b6m0f8dk6nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle-building supplements, which may be legal, can serve as gateway drugs to steroid use,” Nagata said. “We &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7235901/" target="_blank"&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; that young adults using muscle-building substances were three times more likely to start anabolic steroid use seven years later.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000q3b6m6o0jagb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pre-workout supplements often contain caffeine — some with the same amount found in several cups of coffee, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000r3b6m13zcnh8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people “dry scoop” before a workout or consume protein powder dry without mixing in water, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000s3b6mt5n6nwnc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Dry scooping is particularly dangerous practice because it provides a high and potent dose of a product that is meant to be diluted in water,” he said. “Dry scooping provides a pure and highly concentrated burst of a product that can have toxic effects.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000t3b6m6ng9z09j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One important step is to challenge the information and ideals coming out of social media, especially for teens who are undergoing rapid changes and making frequent comparisons with others during puberty, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000u3b6m7gu28ic8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Social media posts about muscle-building supplements and anabolic steroids overwhelmingly demonstrate positive muscle-building effects,” he said. “Social media can exacerbate body comparisons and lead to muscle dissatisfaction and the use of anabolic steroids or other muscle-building drugs and supplements in teens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000v3b6mej4ew30e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This use of social media is especially true for boys, who are more likely to allow for a public following than girls and are more likely to show off muscles online than faces, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000w3b6mz6rz7os8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. The idealized bodies that influencers post may be heavily filtered or the best of hundreds of photos,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000x3b6ma6vgftoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to treating muscle dysmorphia, there are many methods that can be helpful, including different forms of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; that help examine thought patterns and reframe perceptions, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000y3b6mhcpnsg7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes medications –– such as those used to treat anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder –– are needed as well, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000z3b6mfn37icw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Families, health care professionals and sports coaches are key in helping to identify muscle dysmorphia in adolescents and young adults, Saltz said.

            Because the imagined defect feels so real to the person experiencing the condition, it can be hard to have insight into the problem, she added. The people around an individual with muscle dysmorphia can help by knowing what to look for.

            Protein shakes, pre-workout mixes and other supplements aren’t always just a part of a gym routine. In adolescents and young adults, they could be connected to a body image disorder that exhibits a pathological focus on muscle development and leanness, according to new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00083b6mmy8v4gdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The use of 6 different dietary supplements intended for muscle building was associated with greater symptoms of muscle dysmorphia,” said lead study author&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto, via email. “This included whey protein powder and creatine, both of which are commonly used among young people trying to gain muscle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00093b6my41c50oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The association was especially strong with supplements for gaining weight or mass, and the symptoms, such as excessive gym time and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;obsessing over food intake, increased as the number of supplements used grew, according to a new study published Wednesday in journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study team analyzed data from 2,731 participants ages 16 to 30 of the &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/canadian-study-of-adolescent-health-behaviors/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to gather information on disordered eating, muscle-building behavior, body image and social health. The researchers analyzed the participants’ reports of supplement use against their symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, which were assessed using &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6239320/" target="_blank"&gt;the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory&lt;/a&gt;, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000b3b6m7ohuv0tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study is observational, meaning it’s hard to say whether the use of supplements increased the symptoms of muscle dysmorphia or if people with more muscle dysmorphia symptoms were more likely to take more supplements, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College. Saltz was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000c3b6muchf6voc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study shows that younger people who may not use &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/health/bodybuilding-steroids-testicular-damage-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt;, which have been found to be harmful, might still be using other substances to treat their muscle dysmorphia, and the public needs to be more aware, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000d3b6ma8k7k6jw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people think supplements are safe because it’s just a supplement,” she said. “But in fact, that is not always the case.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000e3b6mzskzpowv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is a subset of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/body-dysmorphia/" target="_blank"&gt;body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/a&gt;, in which an individual is preoccupied with an imagined defect in their appearance, Saltz said. Those with muscle dysmorphia believe their body should be leaner and more muscular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000f3b6mcd5cdslm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who experience muscle dysmorphia often have significant challenges in their social lives, and can experience severe emotional distress,” Ganson said. “Not to mention, these individuals may go to extreme lengths to achieve their body ideal, such as using anabolic steroids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000g3b6m8n168aan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it isn’t just a matter of lowered confidence, Saltz said. Even if people with this disorder reach the ideal image they are striving for, it doesn’t fix the distress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000h3b6m7g1lp4yw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When they look in the mirror, they don’t see what you see when you look at them,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000i3b6mp7ackz6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other warning signs include having a rigid exercise routine, experiencing emotional distress, and facing difficulty completing expectations such as school and work, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000j3b6m76ll636f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You might also see people with muscle dysmorphic disorder avoiding socially normal body exposure — such as removing their shirts at the beach — or missing social gatherings because of feelings around their appearance, Saltz added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000k3b6mhl1vi4x7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using supplements to change a body’s appearance is common.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000l3b6mc29l0v1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While 2.2% of young adult males report using steroids, 36.3% report using protein powders and shakes, while 10.1% said they use other muscle-building substances such as creatine and growth hormones, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101778" target="_blank"&gt;a June 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000m3b6mllgt6myx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most supplements are readily available with little to no regulation, and “studies analyzing these products have found that many are mislabeled and are tainted with harmful substances like anabolic steroids,” said study coauthor Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000n3b6mj1e8cbcu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration does monitor adverse health impacts and occasionally inspects manufacturing facilities. However, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the agency does not have jurisdiction to approve dietary supplements before they enter the public marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000o3b6m2ss7xcni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are also few studies on supplements’ safety and efficacy, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000p3b6m0f8dk6nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle-building supplements, which may be legal, can serve as gateway drugs to steroid use,” Nagata said. “We &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7235901/" target="_blank"&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; that young adults using muscle-building substances were three times more likely to start anabolic steroid use seven years later.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000q3b6m6o0jagb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pre-workout supplements often contain caffeine — some with the same amount found in several cups of coffee, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000r3b6m13zcnh8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people “dry scoop” before a workout or consume protein powder dry without mixing in water, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000s3b6mt5n6nwnc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Dry scooping is particularly dangerous practice because it provides a high and potent dose of a product that is meant to be diluted in water,” he said. “Dry scooping provides a pure and highly concentrated burst of a product that can have toxic effects.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000t3b6m6ng9z09j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One important step is to challenge the information and ideals coming out of social media, especially for teens who are undergoing rapid changes and making frequent comparisons with others during puberty, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000u3b6m7gu28ic8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Social media posts about muscle-building supplements and anabolic steroids overwhelmingly demonstrate positive muscle-building effects,” he said. “Social media can exacerbate body comparisons and lead to muscle dissatisfaction and the use of anabolic steroids or other muscle-building drugs and supplements in teens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000v3b6mej4ew30e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This use of social media is especially true for boys, who are more likely to allow for a public following than girls and are more likely to show off muscles online than faces, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000w3b6mz6rz7os8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. The idealized bodies that influencers post may be heavily filtered or the best of hundreds of photos,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000x3b6ma6vgftoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to treating muscle dysmorphia, there are many methods that can be helpful, including different forms of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; that help examine thought patterns and reframe perceptions, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000y3b6mhcpnsg7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes medications –– such as those used to treat anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder –– are needed as well, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000z3b6mfn37icw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Families, health care professionals and sports coaches are key in helping to identify muscle dysmorphia in adolescents and young adults, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00103b6mcc3f2nmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            Muscle dysmorphia is a subset of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/body-dysmorphia/" target="_blank"&gt;body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/a&gt;, in which an individual is preoccupied with an imagined defect in their appearance, Saltz said. Those with muscle dysmorphia believe their body should be leaner and more muscular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000f3b6mcd5cdslm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who experience muscle dysmorphia often have significant challenges in their social lives, and can experience severe emotional distress,” Ganson said. “Not to mention, these individuals may go to extreme lengths to achieve their body ideal, such as using anabolic steroids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000g3b6m8n168aan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it isn’t just a matter of lowered confidence, Saltz said. Even if people with this disorder reach the ideal image they are striving for, it doesn’t fix the distress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000h3b6m7g1lp4yw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When they look in the mirror, they don’t see what you see when you look at them,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000i3b6mp7ackz6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other warning signs include having a rigid exercise routine, experiencing emotional distress, and facing difficulty completing expectations such as school and work, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000j3b6m76ll636f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You might also see people with muscle dysmorphic disorder avoiding socially normal body exposure — such as removing their shirts at the beach — or missing social gatherings because of feelings around their appearance, Saltz added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000k3b6mhl1vi4x7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using supplements to change a body’s appearance is common.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000l3b6mc29l0v1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While 2.2% of young adult males report using steroids, 36.3% report using protein powders and shakes, while 10.1% said they use other muscle-building substances such as creatine and growth hormones, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101778" target="_blank"&gt;a June 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000m3b6mllgt6myx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most supplements are readily available with little to no regulation, and “studies analyzing these products have found that many are mislabeled and are tainted with harmful substances like anabolic steroids,” said study coauthor Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000n3b6mj1e8cbcu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration does monitor adverse health impacts and occasionally inspects manufacturing facilities. However, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the agency does not have jurisdiction to approve dietary supplements before they enter the public marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000o3b6m2ss7xcni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are also few studies on supplements’ safety and efficacy, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000p3b6m0f8dk6nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle-building supplements, which may be legal, can serve as gateway drugs to steroid use,” Nagata said. “We &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7235901/" target="_blank"&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; that young adults using muscle-building substances were three times more likely to start anabolic steroid use seven years later.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000q3b6m6o0jagb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pre-workout supplements often contain caffeine — some with the same amount found in several cups of coffee, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000r3b6m13zcnh8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people “dry scoop” before a workout or consume protein powder dry without mixing in water, Nagata added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000s3b6mt5n6nwnc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Dry scooping is particularly dangerous practice because it provides a high and potent dose of a product that is meant to be diluted in water,” he said. “Dry scooping provides a pure and highly concentrated burst of a product that can have toxic effects.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000t3b6m6ng9z09j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One important step is to challenge the information and ideals coming out of social media, especially for teens who are undergoing rapid changes and making frequent comparisons with others during puberty, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000u3b6m7gu28ic8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Social media posts about muscle-building supplements and anabolic steroids overwhelmingly demonstrate positive muscle-building effects,” he said. “Social media can exacerbate body comparisons and lead to muscle dissatisfaction and the use of anabolic steroids or other muscle-building drugs and supplements in teens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000v3b6mej4ew30e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This use of social media is especially true for boys, who are more likely to allow for a public following than girls and are more likely to show off muscles online than faces, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000w3b6mz6rz7os8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. The idealized bodies that influencers post may be heavily filtered or the best of hundreds of photos,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000x3b6ma6vgftoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to treating muscle dysmorphia, there are many methods that can be helpful, including different forms of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; that help examine thought patterns and reframe perceptions, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000y3b6mhcpnsg7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes medications –– such as those used to treat anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder –– are needed as well, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000z3b6mfn37icw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Families, health care professionals and sports coaches are key in helping to identify muscle dysmorphia in adolescents and young adults, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00103b6mcc3f2nmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the imagined defect feels so real to the person experiencing the condition, it can be hard to have insight into the problem, she added. The people around an individual with muscle dysmorphia can help by knowing what to look for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Protein shakes, pre-workout mixes and other supplements aren’t always just a part of a gym routine. In adolescents and young adults, they could be connected to a body image disorder that exhibits a pathological focus on muscle development and leanness, according to new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00083b6mmy8v4gdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The use of 6 different dietary supplements intended for muscle building was associated with greater symptoms of muscle dysmorphia,” said lead study author&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto, via email. “This included whey protein powder and creatine, both of which are commonly used among young people trying to gain muscle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00093b6my41c50oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The association was especially strong with supplements for gaining weight or mass, and the symptoms, such as excessive gym time and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;obsessing over food intake, increased as the number of supplements used grew, according to a new study published Wednesday in journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.

            The study team analyzed data from 2,731 participants ages 16 to 30 of the &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/canadian-study-of-adolescent-health-behaviors/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to gather information on disordered eating, muscle-building behavior, body image and social health. The researchers analyzed the participants’ reports of supplement use against their symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, which were assessed using &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6239320/" target="_blank"&gt;the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory&lt;/a&gt;, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study is observational, meaning it’s hard to say whether the use of supplements increased the symptoms of muscle dysmorphia or if people with more muscle dysmorphia symptoms were more likely to take more supplements, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College. Saltz was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000c3b6muchf6voc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study shows that younger people who may not use &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/health/bodybuilding-steroids-testicular-damage-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt;, which have been found to be harmful, might still be using other substances to treat their muscle dysmorphia, and the public needs to be more aware, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000d3b6ma8k7k6jw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            “Dry scooping is particularly dangerous practice because it provides a high and potent dose of a product that is meant to be diluted in water,” he said. “Dry scooping provides a pure and highly concentrated burst of a product that can have toxic effects.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000t3b6m6ng9z09j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One important step is to challenge the information and ideals coming out of social media, especially for teens who are undergoing rapid changes and making frequent comparisons with others during puberty, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000u3b6m7gu28ic8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Social media posts about muscle-building supplements and anabolic steroids overwhelmingly demonstrate positive muscle-building effects,” he said. “Social media can exacerbate body comparisons and lead to muscle dissatisfaction and the use of anabolic steroids or other muscle-building drugs and supplements in teens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000v3b6mej4ew30e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This use of social media is especially true for boys, who are more likely to allow for a public following than girls and are more likely to show off muscles online than faces, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000w3b6mz6rz7os8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. The idealized bodies that influencers post may be heavily filtered or the best of hundreds of photos,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000x3b6ma6vgftoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to treating muscle dysmorphia, there are many methods that can be helpful, including different forms of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; that help examine thought patterns and reframe perceptions, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000y3b6mhcpnsg7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes medications –– such as those used to treat anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder –– are needed as well, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg000z3b6mfn37icw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Families, health care professionals and sports coaches are key in helping to identify muscle dysmorphia in adolescents and young adults, Saltz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7cdb9wg00103b6mcc3f2nmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the imagined defect feels so real to the person experiencing the condition, it can be hard to have insight into the problem, she added. The people around an individual with muscle dysmorphia can help by knowing what to look for.
    &lt;/p&gt;

'So unfortunately, a lot of them are made with aspartame - actually rat poison.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Number four was a little more unexpected - coconut water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Out of season, it can be a problem,' she shared with viewers. 'Not only does it have a little bit of sugar, but it does have deuterium and can really deplete your energy over time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then shared the fifth and final toxic drink - fruit juice, which she labeled as the 'surprising one.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Fruit juice] is very high in fructose can cause that fatty liver,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, Dr. Bowring revealed the bizarre secret to living longer - suggesting that taking fewer breaths may actually be the secret to a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The average adult takes about 15 to 20 breaths per minute, which is actually far too much,' Dr. Bowring claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Multiple analyses of real-world data, along with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00207-4/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in animals, have suggested that link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could be huge for those with alcohol-use disorder, which is when a person can't stop drinking even when it puts their health and safety at risk. The condition affects almost 30 million people in the U.S., and encompasses what people generally refer to as alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence or alcoholism, &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use accounts for 2.6 million deaths per year, and increases the risk of common diseases such as different cancers, the study authors wrote. There are three medications already approved for alcohol-use disorder, but the authors said only a small share of patients with the condition receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new data adds to growing evidence that GLP-1s, such as Ozempic and its weight loss counterpart Wegovy, can help people manage cravings – and not just for food and alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some preliminary research has suggested the drugs &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/beyond-appetite-suppression" target="_blank"&gt;may dampen cravings&lt;/a&gt; for smoking, opioid use, gambling, and excessive shopping by hampering activation of the brain's reward pathways. GLP-1s mimic hormones produced in the gut to suppress a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But larger and longer studies will need to confirm the effect of those drugs on addictive behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers recruited people ages 21 to 65 who reported symptoms of alcohol-use disorder but weren't actively seeking treatment for it. Patients with diabetes and those who have previously used a GLP-1 or other weight loss medications were &lt;a href="https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/psych/0/yoi240094supp2_prod_1737737528.72584.pdf?Expires=1743013860&amp;amp;amp;Signature=bgRsJSW-hEji3glyyTgXe84iWUN2PMgqmobbZm992fBQqn1J9M2AP5v4GVQB7k03pzXo2NdsS0WUaH1Gv3ekPqman2MDK2kcjBzddY0-uIxNqh7PtqOxg0mfB19Nlhz3fsegh35f8qVjkcb0ywiTf4DjwQ82W0CdqHsfVfT5W82FZhhd9FWLbI7diVH9y6wJ~sI486eaLts0DD2oPbNbA5aB8VRIJvEDutyUyM-as~qBOa~wPF1SBqEzUhRsKLkoUgrajmmi1xW~WPC2uAt1bbA2GeQUwslBV06kV9MptmcMtTl~yLBITEuGSVh0HYLGijFI6nF9z6uzH6j4FHqkBQ__&amp;amp;amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" target="_blank"&gt;excluded&lt;/a&gt; from the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients spent two hours in a lab room stocked with their preferred alcoholic beverages – once before they started taking any drugs in the study, and once after to see what had changed. Around half of the people took low doses of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and half received placebo shots weekly for nine weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also reported their drinking habits and desire for alcohol throughout the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results suggested that Ozempic injections decreased weekly alcohol cravings, cut the average number of beverages consumed on drinking days and led to greater reductions in heavy drinking days when compared to the placebo. Notably, Ozempic's effect on curbing several drinking outcomes appeared to be greater than what is often seen with existing medications that aim to reduce alcohol cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the second month of the study, people who took Ozempic were drinking 30% less on average on days they consumed alcohol. That compared to an average reduction of about 2% in the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40% of people who took Ozempic reported no heavy drinking days in the second month of treatment, compared with 20% in the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors noted that they used the two lowest clinical doses of semaglutide in the trial. Higher doses of the drug would "presumably yield greater effects on alcohol reduction," they added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These data suggest the potential of semaglutide and similar drugs to fill an unmet need for the treatment of alcohol use disorder," senior author Klara Klein of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said in a &lt;a href="https://today.usc.edu/popular-weight-loss-diabetes-drug-shows-promise-in-reducing-cravings-for-alcohol/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "Larger and longer studies in broader populations are needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy in people with alcohol use disorder, but these initial findings are promising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among a small subgroup of people who smoked, those who took Ozempic had significantly greater reductions in average cigarettes per day compared to those in the placebo group. That suggests Ozempic may reduce both alcohol and nicotine use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/LLY/"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; plans to study whether its weight loss drugs can help treat addictive behaviors like alcohol and drug abuse.

Primary care physicians don't think it's such a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic health startup Omada released &lt;a href="https://resourcecenter.omadahealth.com/blog/doctors-report-concerns-about-overprescribing-and-continuity-of-care-with-patient-access-to-glp-1-medications-through-third-party-telehealth" target="_blank"&gt;a survey&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2,000 primary care physicians last week that assessed their attitudes toward GLP-1s and various treatment plans. By and large, the doctors said they are concerned about third-party telehealth providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than 20% of physicians surveyed said they would be comfortable with patients using third-party telehealth providers to access GLP-1 medications. Two-thirds of respondents said they agree that accessing the prescriptions through a third-party telehealth provider could put patients' health at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was alarming, I didn't even think it would be that high," Omada President Wei-Li Shao told CNBC in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omada does not prescribe GLP-1s, but the company offers a companion program that supports patients who are taking the medications. It also aims to help patients maintain their weight loss if they decide to stop taking the drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found that primary physicians are mainly worried about third-party telehealth providers for two reasons: overprescribing and continuity of care. In other words, they're concerned patients could access GLP-1s when it is not clinically appropriate, and that they might not receive the support they need through additional touch points like follow-up visits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many of the doctors surveyed are on the fence about the role of compounded GLP-1s, which are custom-made alternatives to brand-name drugs designed to meet a specific patient's needs. Compounded medications can also be produced when brand-name treatments are in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/compounding-and-fda-questions-and-answers" target="_blank"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA doesn't review the safety and efficacy of compounded products, but they can serve as alternatives to branded medications for patients who are navigating complex supply hurdles and spotty insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 45% of physicians surveyed said compounded GLP-1s are not going to be a long-term supply strategy, though they agreed that they can be helpful for addressing current shortages. And 30% of respondents said they agreed or strongly agreed that they are comfortable prescribing compounded GLP-1s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients or people that are searching for solutions are confused," Shao said. "What our position has been is talk to your doctor, talk to your primary care doctor, who knows you, knows your history, knows what you've been on, and knows what your goals are, and has a perspective on what is the right treatment in partnership with you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full report &lt;a href="https://resourcecenter.omadahealth.com/white-papers/survey-report-primary-care-perspectives-on-glp-1-prescriptions" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com." target="_blank"&gt;ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Health plans grapple with costs of new sickle cell gene therapies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been just over a year since the FDA approved sickle cell gene therapies.

'Not only does it have a little bit of sugar, but it does have deuterium and can really deplete your energy over time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then shared the fifth and final toxic drink - fruit juice, which she labeled as the 'surprising one.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Fruit juice] is very high in fructose can cause that fatty liver,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, Dr. Bowring revealed the bizarre secret to living longer - suggesting that taking fewer breaths may actually be the secret to a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The average adult takes about 15 to 20 breaths per minute, which is actually far too much,' Dr. Bowring claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The first beverage Dr. Janine Bowring urged people to avoid is alcohol (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The doctor also suggested avoiding diet sodas and coconut water (stock images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you can slow your breathing down to about five point five breaths per minute, that is related now to longevity,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor then started to compare human beings to other animals, like dolphins and whales, who take fewer breaths and live 'much longer' than humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said that these mammals only take three to five breaths per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whereas, a mouse takes 90 to 250 breaths per minute, and they only live two to seven years,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stress, as we know, when we're stressed out, we breathe more quickly, and we know that stress is definitely correlated with a shorter life, so my tip here is to consciously breathe, slowing down the breath,' the doctor continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is one of the reasons why meditation and yoga can be really powerful and helping you to live longer,' she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 21:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNeHhoX21hWUZZNDRGRUZud0xUNFdtdHRxY295R01UdEV1cVFBdVB1T3RsZXhobHdnVTJmekdJRmlXMlpXOF9vbGtETzNVU3VCVHd3dk9XOVp5dmJaUk1pbmZJcnhqbDdfVkRxVXdoS3A0aG85Ym5rRVBKZDR6LXpWMC1YbVhQVlFQbjZhMGI0S21MUFZJTXAtVzVDNnVEbXNranFfV1R2dlBPdXp5</guid></item><item><title>Canada announces avian flu vaccine buy as USDA confirms first H5N1 detections in rats - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxPVDFma1FKUmxfY29EVW5UNE92UUh4c1RrNmFtY0Y1Mk5HS3NEMDZTZlljeEJJNTJNT3ZnZ3NZLV9VeXl1R0ZvSHVFUWpDb3l6dk9mejZJak5oVzdwLTJpa3FMcXRIdDNsQy0zYWJLTVJoT2ktaWNOdmplN1FLX0dOOF9HN2pvdGF6ZzlDMUZzcllISDNfX1lRMDJDbzNsYjRKcjN3TTcxOE9NYS1HUHBSWVpCb2ZrSjZIeWVLbzI5d3o5RGFa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) today announced that it has secured 500,000 initial doses of GSK's human vaccine against avian influenza to protect people most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other avian flu developments, tests at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have confirmed the H5N1 strain in rats for the first time, as the agency acknowledged that it was reversing recent layoffs of employees working on the avian flu response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Distributing and stockpiling vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/02/government-of-canada-purchases-avian-influenza-vaccine-to-protect-individuals-most-at-risk.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, PHAC said its purchase leverages an existing agreement with GSK. "This vaccine will be used as part of Canada's contingency planning to protect people who may be at increased risk of being exposed to the virus through animals infected with avian influenza," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arepanrix H5N1 A/American wigeon clade 2.3.4.4b vaccine uses established technology for seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines. Health Canada on February 18 completed its review of GSK's regulatory submission and authorized the change in vaccine strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the general public remains low, PHAC said, adding that 60% of the doses will be equitably distributed to provinces and territories using a risk-based approach, and 40% will be kept in Canada's national stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Initial recommendations from vaccine advisers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) released &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/vaccines-immunization/national-advisory-committee-immunization-summary-rapid-response-preliminary-guidance-human-vaccination-avian-influenza-non-pandemic-december-2024.html"&gt;preliminary guidance&lt;/a&gt; on the use of human vaccines against avian flu in nonpandemic settings. Though the NACI doesn't recommend broad H5N1 vaccine deployment, it outlined situations in which provinces and territories might proactively use it based on higher risk, including for lab workers and people with ongoing contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union have stockpiled avian flu vaccine for people, and the United Kingdom recently ordered 5 million doses of H5 vaccine from CSL Seqirus. Finland is already vaccinating people at high risk, including workers at fur farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada has reported several H5N1 detections in poultry and wild birds, especially in British Columbia, where in November a severe infection was reported in a teen whose exposure to the virus is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First H5N1 detections in rats &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today added eight more H5N1 avian flu confirmations to its list of &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;detections in mammals&lt;/a&gt;, including rats for the first time. Officials have previously confirmed the virus in mice found on affected farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the eight detections, four involved black rats that were sampled in late January in Riverside County, California, where two recent poultry outbreaks were reported, one of them involving layer pullets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other infected mammals include a harbor seal in Massachusetts, a fox in North Dakota, a bobcat in Washington state, and a domestic cat in Oregon that likely relates to a recent report of two pets from Multnomah County that were sickened after eating raw pet food contaminated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APHIS hasn't posted any new poultry or dairy cattle confirmations since February 14, but today it did add three more H5N1 confirmations in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/wild-birds"&gt;wild birds&lt;/a&gt;, including an agency-harvested raven in California's Riverside County, an agency-harvested duck in New Mexico (Socorro County), and a hunter-harvested duck in Alabama (Marshall County).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reversing USDA firings of avian flu response employees&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following terminations over the weekend of USDA employees who are working on the avian flu response, the agency is working quickly to restore the positions, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/usda-accidentally-fired-officials-bird-flu-rehire-rcna192716"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reported yesterday, citing a statement from a USDA spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson added that USDA Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS) frontline positions are considered public safety positions and that the agency is continuing to hire the workforce needed to protect the nation's food supply according to its statutory mission. The official added that several positions were already exempted from cuts and that the USDA continues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hear the phrase “gluten-free,” you may imagine someone with a healthy lifestyle and a slender frame. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11130-024-01264-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has some unsavory news: Many gluten-free products are packed with sugar and calories, lack essential nutrients like fiber and protein and are more expensive to boot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing in the journal &lt;em&gt;Plant Foods for Human Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, researchers looked at 39 gluten-free products and compared them to their gluten-filled alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They discovered that, on average, the gluten-free items had significantly less protein and more sugar and calories than their counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenges the conventional wisdom that gluten-free products are somehow magically good for managing your weight — in fact, these findings suggest that the opposite may be true. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The new study is just the latest to indicate that — unless you have a genuine gluten allergy or sensitvity — forgoing gluten may not be the healthiest choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7920475/#:~:text=In%20the%20groups%20of%20patients,is%20shown%20in%20Table%201." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that 81% of patients who were placed on a gluten-free diet gained weight after two years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another, publishing in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2012.05001.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, the BMI of celiac patients increased from an average of 24 to 24.6 once they were on a gluten-free diet, with the biggest difference observed in strict adherents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from the caloric content, another problem may lie in how these foods are made. &lt;/p&gt;

often add supplements to gluten-free products that may make them harder to digest.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Sirisab – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Currently, many gluten-free products lack dietary fiber, protein and essential nutrients,” &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/sachin-rustgi-2294460" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sachin Rustgi&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of molecular breeding at Clemson University, wrote in &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/many-gluten-free-foods-are-high-in-calories-and-sugar-low-on-fiber-and-protein-and-they-cost-more-new-research-247165" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturers often add supplements to compensate, but the incorporation of dietary fibers during processing can hinder protein digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rustgi, who was a co-author of the study, also pointed out that many gluten-free products mostly lack wheat, rye, barley and oats — all of which are rich sources of arabinoxylan, an insoluble fiber that promotes digestive health by aiding bowel movement and preventing constipation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of this points to the conclusion, echoed by other medical experts, that a gluten-free diet should only really be adopted by people who have celiac disease or are otherwise sensitive to gluten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019566632030653X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;25% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; eat gluten-free products, which is much higher than the roughly 1% of the population that is estimated to &lt;a href="https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Measles is caused by the morvillivirus, which can lead to serious health complications, especially in children under 5 who aren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated individuals," Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Yahoo News. "If you have a significant population that has not been vaccinated, then measles can rip through those populations very quickly because it's one of the most highly transmissible virus agents we know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-does-measles-spread"&gt;How does measles spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks. It’s so contagious that nine out of 10 people exposed to the virus will get infected if they have not been vaccinated, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles "has a reproductive number of between 12 and 18," Hotez explained. "It means a single individual can, on average, infect another 12 to 18 unvaccinated individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Airborne droplets of the virus can remain in a room for two hours, even after the person with measles has left the room, according to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8584-measles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Droplets of the measles virus can also land on surfaces and spread to other people that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles can also be spread by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sharing food or drinks or kissing someone who has measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaking or holding hands or hugging someone with measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If someone touches a surface containing the virus and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pregnant women with measles can give it to their babies either during pregnancy or while nursing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-measles"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles symptoms can appear seven to 14 days after a person has contact with the virus.

At first, these harsh truths may dampen our spirits and make us feel that the world is a bit colder. However, understanding some of &lt;a href="https://www.upworthy.com/17-life-lessons-rp" target="_self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;life's hard lessons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opens us up to greater possibilities and can help us overcome the obstacles holding us back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harsh truths help us realize when relationships aren’t as great as they can be. They also prevent us from having too much faith in people and institutions that will ultimately disappoint us. Knowing dark truths can also help us appreciate the things that are truly beautiful, honest, and good. A Redditor named Rare_Can_5418 asked the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ew56dj/what_difficult_truths_the_sooner_you_accept_them/?" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AskReddit forum,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “What difficult truths, the sooner you accept them, the better your life will be?” and received over 6,500 responses. Many of them were centered around harsh truths about relationships and the fact that even if we do our best in life, we can still end up with the short end of the stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to keep going and never let failure get you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 15 of the “difficult truths” that made people’s lives a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stop comparing yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"There will always be someone better looking, better educated, younger, more experienced, more intelligent or wealthier than you. Do your best, live without regret, have empathy and kindness, give when you can, expecting nothing in return. Focus on your heart value more than what others have."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Comparison is the thief of joy."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Some people won't like you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can be sweetest, juiciest peach on the tree. But some people don't like peaches."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"In Spanish, there's a saying: 'Nadie es moneda de oro para que lo quiera todo el mundo,' which translates to something like nobody is a gold coin to be liked/wanted by everyone else."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Things are just things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"They don’t have feelings. They don’t care if you give them away or sell them or throw them out. If a thing is useful, keep it. If not, get rid of it."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists refer to perceiving that inanimate objects have feelings as anthropomorphizing. &lt;em&gt;Psych Central&lt;/em&gt; says that humans project feelings onto objects to relate to them more deeply. "People generally anthropomorphize to make sense of events and behaviors they experience. Further, attributing emotions, attitudes, mental states, faces, and values to non-human things can help you feel connected to something," Sarah Barkley writes in a&lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/why-do-we-anthropomorphize" target="_blank"&gt; PhD-reviewed article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Not all friendships last&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Surprisingly though, the ones that last are not necessarily the best (or even good) ones."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Most friendships are based on convenience, I've found. Unless two people are willing to put in a lot of effort, time and distance will do more to end a friendship than any disagreement."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. You may be the bad guy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can do your best with someone and still be the villain in their story."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"One of my current favourite memes is: I don't care if I'm the villain in your story, you're the clown in mine."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. You can't change people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can only help people who actually want it. If they’re not ready to change or put in the effort, there’s not much you can do. Realizing this can save you a lot of frustration and help you focus on people who actually appreciate your help."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It’s always tough having those friends who are constantly complaining but doing nothing to address what they are complaining about. But as an adult, you just have to sit there and listen. No point in offering help to someone who isn’t asking for it. Kinda like how it’s really tough to teach someone who isn’t interested in being taught."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. How we judge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We judge ourselves by our intentions. We judge others by their actions."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"In psychology, this is called fundamental attribution error."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fundamental Attribution Error is &lt;a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/the-fundamental-attribution-error" target="_blank"&gt;a psychological phenomenon &lt;/a&gt;where we assume someone's actions reflect their personality without considering the situation. It's like when we blame someone's driving skills for being in an accident instead of the curvy road. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Depending on people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Once you're an adult, there really isn't anyone you can 100% depend on except yourself. There will still be people in your life to lean on, but everyone has their limits in how they can help you."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Nice doesn't equal good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Nice people aren't always good people."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"One of my bosses doesn't greet/make small talk and is known for being quite firm. He's been the most helpful throughout my most difficult period dealing with tragedy. Some people with that personality type simply get things done when you need them done without the chattering."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Everything is temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You can suddenly lose anything and anyone at any time...and maybe all at once or in quick succession without so much warning."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Nobody is thinking about you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"In general, people in the real world are oblivious to you. You're not even a blip on their radar. If you're insecure about something you wear or how you look, remember: nobody cares."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. No one is coming to save you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"No one is coming to save you, so you have to do it all yourself."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"And once you internalize this and do it, your self-esteem will be through the roof."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Nobody knows what they're doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Before i graduated high school I thought, thank god, I finally won’t have to deal with annoying obnoxious kids and I’ll be treated like an adult, I come to find out 95% of adults are worse then the actual kids, nobody knows what they’re actually doing and life is actually a big joke."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Love is reciprocal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If a romantic interest is not giving you the same attention/respect you give them, they don't really care about or want you, and you're in for a world of hurt if you keep telling yourself otherwise."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Who's good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"People who are good for you will make you feel happy, joyful, accepted, cared for, and filled with fun times, despite any differences. People who are not good for you will make you feel anxious, sad, down, slighted, judged, and never check in on you if you're not okay, and won't even bother noticing when you're not okay. Genuine people will never let you suffer in silence or watch you suffer. Stay away from those who make you feel negative emotions and thoughts."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared last year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Upworthy</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNOHFZamRhR004TXFLZXJ4R3lXal9wVHBjd0hpXzBlejEteHlVYm9OQzkyQV9Xb1BzLXJYLVNVeXBEcERUbF9JRUZUN2E3SFZ6ZHhKT1pqZUlDcnQ0NjA2ZHY4SlpmVWc2aktFWWFZWXhOeXZjX1JTOEFjVGRXdkZYWDF4ZXpCdW1CNTllcGVEUnhvRlRFTjBhc1hKZkRBZkx6OV8tenBNR2ZjdkxrczhEQnk5RQ</guid></item><item><title>Autopsy reveals new details in man’s death after being in Knox County custody - WATE 6 On Your Side</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

                                        With the dengue virus spreading to people in the Philippines, one neighborhood is taking action—offering a bounty on mosquitoes. The project is the brainchild of Carlito Cernal, village chief of Addition Hills in the city of Mandaluyong east of Manila, who believes capturing the dengue-spreading insects can have a "huge impact" on curbing the spread of the virus, per &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250219-manila-neighbourhood-puts-bounty-on-dengue-carrying-mosquitoes"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;. Though health officials are doubtful, some of the neighborhood's 100,000 residents seem game, per the &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/article/570dea53f828e208765e9d1bec363d24/philippine-village-battles-dengue-by-offering-bounties-for-mosquitos-dead-or-alive.html"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. They lined up outside the village hall on Wednesday with various containers, receiving one peso (just over 1 US cent) for every five mosquitoes, dead or alive. Any live insects are transferred to a UV light machine, where death is certain.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        The Philippines is among the countries most affected by dengue, and cases are on the rise this year. Some 28,200 people were infected in January, up 40% compared to the same month last year, per AFP. Assistant Health Secretary Albert Domingo notes heavy rains driven by climate change have left behind stagnant water, where mosquitoes breed, per the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2025/02/18/2422301/potential-dengue-outbreaks-9-areas-nationwide-doh"&gt;Philippine Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Residents have been urged to eliminate breeding sites and protect themselves from bites to help mitigate dengue outbreaks, already declared in five cities and municipalities. "The sooner we clean our surroundings and overturn any possible areas where stagnant water is collecting, then we will have a better fight against dengue," said Domingo, per AFP.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        Officials in a Quezon City village were mulling over releasing a bunch of frogs, hoping they'd eat the problematic mosquitoes, per the AP. But public health expert Anthony Leachon tells AFP that Addition Hills' mosquito bounty will have "little or no impact," and that some residents might even feel compelled to breed mosquitoes in the hope of bringing in money. However, one local who lined up Wednesday said it wasn't about the coin. "My child suffered from dengue before and I know how scary and difficult that is," she said. Addition Hills has reported 42 dengue cases this year, resulting in the deaths of two young students, the AP reports. The Philippines reported a total of 575 deaths from dengue in 2023.

Many people don’t realize how crucial it is for optimal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eggs-may-slow-memory-decline-and-support-brain-health/"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific magnesium form appears especially helpful when it comes to protecting memory and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to neurologist &lt;a href="https://www.congresodepacientesonline.com/dr-alejandro-guillermo-andersson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alejandro Andersson&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.neurologiainba.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurology Institute of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, magnesium threonate stands out for anyone seeking to support thinking skills and recall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described it as promising for treating neurodegenerative diseases and preventing neurological deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-and-brain-health"&gt;Magnesium and brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks associate magnesium solely with its role in muscle cramps or energy loss. However, low levels of this mineral can disrupt more than just athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/neurotoxin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurotoxins&lt;/a&gt; and other challenges can strain our nerves when magnesium is in short supply. Keeping magnesium levels steady may protect the parts of the brain linked to reasoning and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tsinghua University&lt;/a&gt; showed that boosting magnesium levels in the brain could improve short- and long-term memory in animal models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggested that this mineral increases the number of functional connections between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-better-neural-connections"&gt;Building better neural connections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced amount of &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/what-glutamate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glutamate&lt;/a&gt; can support healthy communication between nerve cells. Too much of this chemical messenger might lead to overstimulation, so magnesium helps keep it in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the mineral interacts with gamma-aminobutyric acid (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt;), known for its role in calming neural circuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By managing these signals, magnesium threonate may promote the creation of new pathways that strengthen learning capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-linked-to-better-brain-power"&gt;Magnesium linked to better brain power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Neurology&lt;/a&gt; classifies magnesium as “&lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/78/17/1337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;probably effective&lt;/a&gt;” in reducing the frequency of migraines for those who get them regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stance comes from observed benefits in preventing attacks or reducing their duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38213402/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2018 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the link between adequate magnesium intake and fewer signs of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reported that people who kept their magnesium levels up showed noticeable improvements in overall mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cautions-and-usage"&gt;Cautions and usage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andersson warns that individuals have their own ideal levels and it is important to clarify that magnesium is not a form of treatment but rather a supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also notes that you should not self-prescribe because it can have unwanted interactions with antibiotics or other medications and, therefore, can reduce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381753/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;absorption and effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend talking with a healthcare provider before trying any new form of magnesium. They may suggest blood tests or dietary strategies to figure out an ideal plan for each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, magnesium is naturally available in nuts, legumes, and leafy green vegetables. Some individuals, though, may still need specialized forms like magnesium threonate to address specific neurological or cognitive concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-Consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that healthy adults typically require around 310 to 420 milligrams of magnesium daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual needs, however, can vary depending on age, gender, and existing medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-magnesium-threonate-is-better"&gt;Why magnesium threonate is better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium threonate sets itself apart by slipping through the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519556/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; more easily than other forms of the mineral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That quality seems to be the main reason for its potential advantages when supporting concentration and clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady supply of this form could help neurons fire efficiently, possibly leading to sharper focus and improved recollection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers speculate that it influences both the architecture and chemistry of brain cells in ways that other magnesium supplements might not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of magnesium threonate believe it can bolster &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-compensate-aging-dementia-recruiting-other-brain-regions-to-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain functions as people age&lt;/a&gt;. They point to its capacity for maintaining neural connections and keeping memory intact over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health professionals see it as a smart addition when combined with good nutrition and adequate sleep. Ongoing studies continue to look at how it might help preserve cognitive well-being in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-the-brain-and-healthy-habits"&gt;Magnesium, the brain, and healthy habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting magnesium levels doesn’t mean skipping standard advice for staying mentally sharp. Eating a balanced diet, moving regularly, and managing stress still form the backbone of any plan for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/playing-instrument-lifelong-music-engagement-better-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;better brain performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone concerned about deficiency should seek guidance from a qualified professional. Simple blood work or dietary evaluations can offer insight into whether supplementation is necessary or desirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with magnesium’s benefits for the brain, moderation remains key. Too little can have negative effects, and too much might be just as troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to recommended guidelines and reputable products helps ensure safety. In the end, paying closer attention to minerals like magnesium might be a game-changer for those aiming to stay mentally agile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20152124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:27:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOOXJ3OGhfaHRJb1lvT01xY1pSVFd6MzE5Q1NwTVFra1VoYlZMRGlSSVZGYVJqWEhqaFVTVW9WS3JySjVUVkFRaEp2WnIwb3E3cjN1WUpkdm9uYnd1MEk4ck5Wak5KU1AyY0kzOHl6TU9COWQtbjhKRUpNaHlGTWl6RmttUEkzcnREX1g2Z3dqREtIdG4yQXlwQTJBOFJEckxSU0hoSzBRSFZJZWEtTGpF</guid></item><item><title>Minnesota to start testing raw cow milk for bird flu - Bring Me The News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNU3FkSjFacnpCTE90YVptTG1TRV8tM1VmVTZVaWtuMEtjdkV6Xzk4MmtsaURNSWpvUnVnTHFPZ1puX3BqcV95TE90VmJSV1ZpRGNyb09yVmtNZlpvdEN6dkpBWVJqYVZiM19LaTZxZ3FmSDI2M1BLTG5ObzdWNjZ3UGlDbVl0bmFGV2hXdlJRWE5IWnB6bXpudmNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:05:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNU3FkSjFacnpCTE90YVptTG1TRV8tM1VmVTZVaWtuMEtjdkV6Xzk4MmtsaURNSWpvUnVnTHFPZ1puX3BqcV95TE90VmJSV1ZpRGNyb09yVmtNZlpvdEN6dkpBWVJqYVZiM19LaTZxZ3FmSDI2M1BLTG5ObzdWNjZ3UGlDbVl0bmFGV2hXdlJRWE5IWnB6bXpudmNB</guid></item><item><title>Ebola outbreak: Uganda discharges patients after recovery - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBObUY3NGVkc3lvUlZ3N3k2QzRWcHMzanFHcmlIQ0dCWGtfekFURmVERTRhOFVxTWZpV3dtbmI2SllqNENjODcxcUYzdXlfc05PbmZhYUZxOW1Bd9IBX0FVX3lxTE4zVnV5MDRkOGZQdHVLMWFaMjZCTjJYUG5RdjZ4dnYzN1dmMWpSVEU5QkZINVEzSEpXOTdJb2dKNWdYVk14Q1Y5WXdZaVEzZ3BmMWxEVnBiT19MNjBiNUw4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Uganda has discharged eight patients who have recovered from the Sudan strain of Ebola after they tested negative twice, health officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The disease has killed one person and infected eight others since an outbreak was reported last month, but 265 people, who were listed for monitoring, remain in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This is the eighth Ebola outbreak in Uganda since the first infection was recorded in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (SUDV) is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues.

But the role the factors play and how much they influence disease development and premature death might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Socioeconomics and lifestyle have more to do with healthy aging than genetics, according to a big new international study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" target="_blank" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; that says both lifestyle choices and living conditions are significantly more important than genetics to living a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the study, of 25 independent exposures associated with premature death, age-related diseases and healthy aging, “We find that the major drivers or premature death and aging in our sample are smoking, socioeconomic status and deprivation, ethnicity, physical activity, living with a partner, sleep and mental and physical wellness including tiredness, as well as early life exposures including health and body size at 10 years and maternal smoking around birth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They note that many factors combine to form the “environmental architecture of mortality and aging,” and each may play a very small role, but adding them up creates a “substantial amount of variation for premature mortality, far exceeding” that posed by genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Your income, postcode and background shouldn’t determine your chances of living a long and healthy life,” Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said in a news release. “But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Study-nuts-and-bolts" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Study nuts and bolts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study was led by researchers from Oxford Population Health in collaboration with researchers from the departments of psychiatry and anthropology at the University of Oxford; Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute, Boston; the University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University, Rotterdam; and the University of Montpellier. They also got technical help from the China Kadoorie Biobank team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The data researchers used included extensive genetic and phenotype information on 502,505 people who were participants in UK Biobank research and data collection. They looked at 164 environmental facts and genetic risk scores for 22 major diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A key part of the research was an “aging clock” that used blood protein levels to see how fast people aged. “This enabled them to link environmental exposures that predict early mortality with biological aging,” the team said in background material on the study. The measure has also been validated in large studies in China and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Cornelia van Dujin, St. Cross professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and the paper’s senior author, noted that instead of focusing on individual exposures and hypotheses, they used a hypothesis-free, lifetime exposure approach to see what drives disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Genes-vs.-lifestyle" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Genes vs. lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors explained 17% of the death risk variation, while genetic predisposition “as we understand it at present” explained just 2%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the 25 environmental factors, those with the most impact on healthy or unhealthy aging were smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity and living conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking was linked to 21 diseases, while socioeconomic factors like household income, employment and home ownership were linked to 19 diseases. Physical activity impacted 17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the factors, 23 could be changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early life exposures, including whether your mother smoked around the time of your birth and your body weight at 10 years old, influenced aging and risk of death decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental exposure had greater effect on lung, heart and liver disease, while genetic risk was stronger for dementias and breast cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote physical activity. While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally,” said van Dujin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She added, “The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate aging early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Austin Argentieri, lead author of the study at Oxford Population Health and research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the approach they used made the research the “most comprehensive to date of the environmental and lifestyle factors driving aging and premature death. These findings underscore the potential benefits of focusing interventions on our environments, socioeconomic contexts and behaviors for the prevention of many age-related diseases and premature death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:39:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOcHdmMzdRVHJ1Ml96TVZpenREamRULXJvcndTWFJUZGhlUHZTeXFzckJmZWl2WG9rcG8zTTZCWk81bGhsVXU3Wk5JSmpQR2FnektnaTlPT1FkVjNyRFdIU1JGaTdxd0V5MkRtSVhHQ1BwSmI0dFVIN1hxeGdlcU5qaVQ0dGNYcUlCZHM3X1lScUw</guid></item><item><title>Government of Canada purchases avian influenza vaccine to protect individuals most at risk - Canada.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxPd2lwei1MenlsVmtwWFAtNl9xZmczcUg1bmpMVE1uWkw1T0JZRDJId1VQb2p2SzdjMzV0a2JjdGpfX19iZmZsaThrOU92LWlram11RnNNbm1qcVl1YkhMMXJ6dUtfQXhlT1F5VFdoTnpDb3RoRkMyemdGSmlmTVhuR3NaM3U3LVV3Mks3ZkZ1dEx2d2Z1cENfV0NVTGlac3VHMGRrdUlSYUZ4NTIxSG4yRXN5WFVhRWV4MUN5ekhzak9qU0I1R2ZmalZTLWl3RTFGNUYybnV2cFAwQVlvRTFqUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cmp-text"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;February 19, 2025 | Ottawa, ON | Public Health Agency of Canada&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and its partners are focused on keeping people and animals in Canada safe and ensuring Canada is ready for any potential health threats. This includes taking proactive measures to protect the health of people in Canada by authorizing and securing the supply of a human vaccine against avian influenza as part of our readiness and potential use, as needed, based on risk conditions. Leveraging an existing agreement, PHAC has secured an initial supply of 500,000 doses of GSK’s human vaccine against avian influenza – ArepanrixTM H5N1 A/American wigeon clade 2.3.4.4b. This vaccine will be used as part of Canada’s contingency planning to protect people who may be at increased risk of being exposed to the virus through animals infected with avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the current risk to the public remains low, individuals with higher-level exposure to infected animals are at increased risk and should take appropriate precautions. Canada reported its first domestically acquired human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) on November 9, 2024, and continued vigilance will help prevent additional human cases. To date, there has been no evidence of sustained person-to-person spread of the virus in any of the cases identified globally. However, avian influenza has the potential to cause serious illness in people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PHAC will provide vaccines to provinces and territories based on an equitable and risk-based approach, with 60% of available doses going to provinces and territories and 40% kept in a federal stockpile for national preparedness. Provinces and territories will make decisions on the potential use and administration of their respective vaccination programs in the context of local risk conditions, with PHAC supporting program monitoring and evaluation to adjust national efforts as needed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has also released preliminary &lt;a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/vaccines-immunization/national-advisory-committee-immunization-summary-rapid-response-preliminary-guidance-human-vaccination-avian-influenza-non-pandemic-december-2024.html"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; on the use of human vaccines against avian influenza in a non-pandemic context. Based on the evolving epidemiological situation in Canada and the United States, broad vaccine deployment is not recommended at this time but the guidance provides recommendations for the possible use of this vaccine by provincial and territorial public health authorities in current and potential future scenarios to protect the health of individuals at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PHAC continues to work closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada, provincial and territorial public health authorities, animal health leaders and experts, industry groups, and international organizations to prepare for and manage the global risks of avian influenza. We remain committed to protecting Canadians by continuously strengthening our preparedness for emerging issues, such as avian influenza, through proactive measures including risk assessments, lab capacity and testing, monitoring and surveillance, science coordination and expert engagement, as well as guidance for professionals and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4sc7k00q42dqgbdxoepxu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a measles outbreak causes dozens of illnesses in West Texas, it’s important to know how to identify signs of the illness – especially in young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8e00043b6mpgrfqj2f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles, one of the world’s most contagious infectious diseases, can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cause serious complications&lt;/a&gt; – such as blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain – and even turn deadly, especially in children younger than 5.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00053b6mz55w2i3o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the US with measles will be hospitalized, and as many as 1 in 20 children with measles will get pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death from measles in young children,” Dr. Melissa Stockwell, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00063b6mi97omsea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, she said, it’s estimated that up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=1%20to%203%20out%20of,Behavioral%20and%20intellectual%20deterioration." target="_blank"&gt;3 out of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00073b6mdtmww55b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If a family has concerns, I urge them to please reach out to their child’s health care provider so they can talk with them and get the facts about measles and measles vaccination,” Stockwell wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00083b6mg4gp27ny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The best protection against measles is vaccination against the virus. But a &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;record share&lt;/a&gt; of US kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations last school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00093b6mkse437mo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services has set a &lt;a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000a3b6mwv1868d1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the US has fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000b3b6mctw61y7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the cases in the current outbreak in West Texas are centered in Gaines County, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coverage of the MMR vaccine is particularly low: Nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year did not get the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000d3b6mya0a321u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early on, measles can cause symptoms that may appear similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or the common cold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000e3b6mll4keh6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With early measles, it’s very difficult to differentiate measles from other common respiratory illnesses. There are three signs that run together: cough; conjunctivitis, or red eyes; and coryza, which is a term for a very congested or stuffy nose,” said Dr. Glenn Fennelly, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist and assistant vice president for global health at Texas Tech Health El Paso.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000f3b6m5cxexn1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you see all three of those together, that’s reason to be concerned,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000g3b6msgljts9e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other key symptoms of measles include a high fever that may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, a red blotchy measles rash and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Koplik spots&lt;/a&gt;, which are tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000h3b6mx9ntzh81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While some of the symptoms of measles in its early phase can overlap with other respiratory viruses like runny nose, cough and fever, typical measles cases have a hallmark rash,” which usually begins three to five days after the other symptoms start, Stockwell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000i3b6mhzjhr1pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If someone develops any of those symptoms, it’s important to have a conversation with their physician or medical care team before taking them to the doctor’s office, urgent care center or hospital, Fennelly said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000j3b6mimcnps1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles is highly contagious. It’s best that the staff has a heads up,” he said, because the person should be “immediately isolated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000k3b6mcjqkyj8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Calling ahead allows the health care provider to make accommodations and provide guidance on how to safely see the patient while reducing the risk of measles spreading in a busy waiting room.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000m3b6meshglwnn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles#:~:text=Measles%20is%20one%20of%20the,for%20up%20to%20two%20hours." target="_blank"&gt;measles virus spreads&lt;/a&gt; through coughing, sneezing and breathing the same air that was breathed by someone infected with measles. The virus can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours – even after the infected person has left the room.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000n3b6mxrxmbo4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that one person infected by measles can infect 9 out of 10 of their close contacts, if those contacts are unvaccinated. Measles is so contagious partly because an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;infected person can spread the virus&lt;/a&gt; to others even before knowing they have it – from four days before through four days after the rash appears.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000o3b6mvzsuepre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The best protection is for all parents to get their children immunized at the time the immunization is recommended, and that’s starting at a year of age, with a second dose recommended around 4 to 6 years of age,” Fennelly said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000q3b6me6kl56c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt; has been found to be safe and effective, Fennelly said. One dose is 93% effective against measles, and two doses are 97% effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000r3b6m290azma0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials’ guidance says children should get two doses of the MMR vaccine: the first between 12 and 15 months and the second around age 4, before starting school. These two doses usually protect people against measles for life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000s3b6m0regfi9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the vaccine is not 100% effective, the more measles spreads, the higher the risk that a vaccinated person may be infected if they’re exposed to the virus. However, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people&lt;/a&gt;, and they are also less likely to spread it to others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000t3b6mcgylpiwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=People%20who%20have%20documentation%20of,two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine." target="_blank"&gt;CDC guidance &lt;/a&gt;also indicates that if someone is exposed to measles, getting the MMR vaccine within 72 hours could induce some protection or result in less serious illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000u3b6mnbv3t0oh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Older children or adults can get vaccinated if they didn’t get the vaccine as a child. However, people born before 1957 are likely to have been naturally infected and thus already have immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20people%20born,two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you got&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the first version of the measles vaccine - a killed-virus vaccine used between 1963 and 1968 - or don’t know which type of vaccine you received, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends getting at least one dose of MMR.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000w3b6m8jslkn3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;1963,&lt;/a&gt; the virus would claim an estimated 2.6 million lives each year worldwide. In 2023, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 107,500 measles deaths, largely in countries with low vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b6ihtv00013b6m3g5cly87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, there have been recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10224336/?c" target="_blank"&gt;declines in some parents getting their children vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, driven largely by the spread of misinformation, including the misconception that vaccination may be tied to autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f000x3b6mcaxrrqnv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles vaccines are safe and effective. There is no validated study showing any link with autism,” Fennelly said. “That measles vaccines are safe has been demonstrated by the millions of children that have received them without complications. What parents should fear, in the case of measles in particular, is not the vaccine but the illness, which can be devastating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There is no specific antiviral therapy for measles, but some of the complications associated with the illness can be treated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There is unfortunately no treatment for measles,” Stockwell wrote in the email.

            “Sometimes measles can result in a secondary infection such as an ear infection or pneumonia that needs antibiotic treatment,” she added. “Finally, vitamin A can be an important adjunctive therapy for measles that can help protect against severe disease and some of the adverse effects of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Fennelly noted that measles is a “strongly immunosuppressive” virus, meaning it weakens the infected person’s immune system, and bacterial infections like bacterial pneumonia are a major cause of measles-related&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Children may have bacterial infections in the respiratory tract that require antibiotic treatment,” Fennelly said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7b4te8f00143b6mraxyv7id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, “any child that’s sick enough to get hospitalized will probably get high-dose vitamin A,” he said. “Vitamin A has been shown to have a very strong impact during acute measles, and for children that are very ill, it can lead to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/#:~:text=In%20Asia%2C%20measles%20was%20found,Vijayaraghavan%201990;%20West%201991)." target="_blank"&gt;50% reduction in mortality&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            People whose doctors say they should stay home can be treated with fever-reducing medications, rest and lots of hydration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s important to isolate the child during the period where the child might be contagious and to stay in close contact with the pediatrician,” Fennelly said. “If a child begins behaving excessively sleepy or very irritable, those would be reasons to get back in touch with the pediatrician.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man whose genetics almost guaranteed that he would develop Alzheimer's disease by his 50s has somehow made it to his mid-70s with nary a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The now-75-year-old man, Doug Whitney, is one of only three people known to have escaped their genetic fate, sidestepping a rare form of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/alzheimers-dementia" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/alzheimers-dementia"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Caused by several gene mutations, DIAD makes up less than 1% of all Alzheimer's cases, and its symptoms typically set in between ages 35 and 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, published Feb. 10 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_9029759685897802227&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03494-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falzheimers-dementia%2Fman-nearly-guaranteed-to-get-early-alzheimers-is-still-disease-free-in-his-70s-how" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03494-0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03494-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Falzheimers-dementia%2Fman-nearly-guaranteed-to-get-early-alzheimers-is-still-disease-free-in-his-70s-how" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, details Whitney's case and pinpoints potential factors that may have shielded him from the neurodegenerative disorder thus far. One hypothesis is that his exposure to very high heat as a shipboard mechanic could have somehow contributed to this resilience, co-lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/jorge-llibre-guerra" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/jorge-llibre-guerra" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Jorge Llibre-Guerra&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of neurology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and co-first author of the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report adds to the handful of cases that are "potentially, a critical source for understanding molecular mechanisms that can slow or stave off Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-greicius" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-greicius" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Michael Greicius&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Alzheimer's researcher at Stanford University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/a-mans-rare-gene-variant-may-have-shielded-him-from-devastating-form-of-early-alzheimers" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/a-mans-rare-gene-variant-may-have-shielded-him-from-devastating-form-of-early-alzheimers"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A man's rare gene variant may have shielded him from devastating form of early Alzheimer's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-shocking-surprise-3"&gt;A "shocking" surprise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney told the research team that he thought he was one of the few who had escaped the mutations that had caused so much DIAD in his family. At age 61 — when Whitney first approached the researchers about enrolling in a large trial about DIAD — he showed no signs of Alzheimer's disease, whereas his mother and 11 of her 13 siblings had developed the condition by the time they were in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIAD is caused by mutations in three genes: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1) or presenilin-2 (PSEN2). The overwhelming majority of people with DIAD only carry one of these mutations, although Llibre-Guerra said he's come across a few who carried more than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you inherit some of these mutations, you have like a 99.99% chance of developing the disease," Llibre-Guerra said. That's why Whitney was "shocked" to discover that he carried a mutation in the PSEN2 gene that should have led to early-onset Alzheimer's, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, at 75, Whitney still hasn't developed symptoms of the condition, which makes him one of three people known to have escaped near-certain DIAD, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand Whitney's apparent protection, Llibre and his colleagues used brain scans to look for the telltale signs of Alzheimer's — namely, abnormal protein clumps called amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques is an early step in the development of Alzheimer's disease, followed by an accumulation of "tangles" of tau protein. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Evidence suggests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the interplay between these two proteins is potentially what leads to cognitive decline, although these &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/146/10/3969/7162122?login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/146/10/3969/7162122?login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may not be the only factors at play&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney's brain turned out to be flooded with amyloid, but unlike in other DIAD patients, the tau had stayed contained within a small section of the brain. These tangles were at the back of his skull, in his left occipital lobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern adds weight to the idea that "if we prevent the downstream effects of amyloid-beta, we might delay the onset of the disease," Llibre-Guerra said. In other words, it seems like the chain reaction between amyloid and tau was somehow broken in Whitney's brain. "The question that we have is, what is preventing tau spread in this particular case?" he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation echoes what had previously been seen in another DIAD "escapee" who also had a mutation in the PSEN1 gene, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alzforum.org/member-directory/jean-charles-lambert" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alzforum.org/member-directory/jean-charles-lambert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jean-Charles Lambert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Alzheimer's researcher from the Inserm Institute at the University of Lille who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="could-extreme-heat-have-been-protective-3"&gt;Could extreme heat have been protective? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few gene variants are known to protect against Alzheimer's. One example is the so-called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896199/#:~:text=APOE%20E2%20is%20associated%20with,protective%20effect%20of%20APOE%20E2." target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896199/#:~:text=APOE%20E2%20is%20associated%20with,protective%20effect%20of%20APOE%20E2." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;E2 allele of the APOE gene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is associated with a very low risk of developing the disease, Lambert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the team did not find any of these known variants in Whitney's genetic makeup. Instead, they pinpointed several other variants that could be interesting to study in the context of Alzheimer's. These include one variant spotted in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/56261" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/56261" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GPCPD1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a gene recently linked to Alzheimer's resilience. Another variant, found in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/945" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/945" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CD33 gene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, could warrant further research, Llibre-Guerra said, as it's involved in immune responses in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists also found higher-than-normal levels of "heat-shock proteins" in Whitney's cerebral spinal fluid, the liquid that cushions the brain and spinal cord. Heat-shock proteins help protect the body from environmental stresses, such as extreme heat, and could be linked to Whitney's time working as a shipboard mechanic in boiling engine rooms, the team suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that these proteins are involved in preventing misfolding proteins in the brain," Llibre-Guerra said. Like origami, proteins must be folded in a particular way to work, and Alzheimer's is a disease in which this folding goes awry. "Maybe it's preventing more tau from being misfolded and spreading," Llibre-Guerra suggested, adding that this is "just a hypothesis" at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lambert, this explanation is "highly speculative," as the evidence to support it is still very tentative. Greicius added that there are "countless other possible explanations" for Whitney's resilience against Alzheimer's, although this is an "interesting and plausible hypothesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's genetic investigation was a "reasonable first analysis," but it could have left "thousands of potentially protective variants unexamined on the cutting-room floor," Greicius added. And because this was a case study of only one person, it's challenging to identify a genetic variant or environmental exposure that may have helped him, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Greicius said, studies like this one are "useful for generating novel hypotheses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk-tfBMgzqycTCCMYqrZwMHZCN4j2ZhRmfS" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-PV8XbMXygcJZtbbNfsjdKk-tfBMgzqycTCCMYqrZwMHZCN4j2ZhRmfS slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Pictured is a model of DMT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, Luke co-authored a study that sought to learn more about this potential link by comparing the experiences of a person who had both an NDE and a trip on 5-MeO-DMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This molecule is very similar to DMT, but its psychedelic effects are not quite as long-lasting and tend to be slightly less intense, according to the Utah Patients Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luke and his colleagues interviewed this person to look for similarities between his NDE and his 5-MeO-DMT-induced psychedelic trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a very high level of comparability between the original NDE and psychedelic experiences in general, including shared characteristics such as entering other worlds, meeting menacing or benevolent entities, experiencing synesthesia, perinatal regression, and lucid dreamlike properties,' the study reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Much comparability was also identified with the 5MeO-DMT experience, in particular the major mystical experiential domains, such as ego dissolution, but especially transcendence of time and space.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers note, however, there were a few unique themes that emerged during the NDE that did not occur during the 5MeO-DMT trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those included encountering the deceased, experiencing a life review (seeing your life flash before your eyes) and seeing 'the threshold,' which can appear as a white light or gateway that represents the point of no return between life and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests these themes may be unique to NDEs. Because of these key differences, the study participant ultimately said his NDE hallucinations could not be definitively linked to psychedelics produced in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers published their findings in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1083361/full"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology &lt;/a&gt;in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this study challenges the idea that DMT could explain all aspects of NDEs, it still might be part of the puzzle, according to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the point of death, the brain undergoes a cascade of neurochemical changes, he explained. That includes surges of serotonin and noradrenaline, which regulate mood, emotions and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DMT may be involved in these neurochemical changes too. Research has shown that this chemical naturally exists in human blood, urine and spinal fluid, so scientists believe it's possible that it could also exist in our brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers will continue to probe this neurochemical to determine whether it truly does help shepherd us toward death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I would teach them how to not be afraid to put their face in the water and because you have to be able to get to a child quickly, you have to be able to go under water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had my contacts in and I would take my goggles off and show them how to go underwater and how fun it was. My eye started to bother me pretty quickly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within two weeks I went to an eye doctor and said I was having problems and they said it was a cornea laceration and I had a crack on my cornea and they gave me some drops to take.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acanthamoeba keratitis is an infection caused by an amoeba - a single-celled organism that is found in freshwater, saltwater, soil and man-made water systems such as pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wearing lenses while swimming, using a hot tub, or shower may entrap the amoeba between the lens and cornea. The parasite can then enter the eye through a scratch or abrasion in the cornea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It starts by affecting the outermost layer of your cornea and as it worsens, the infection extends deeper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said: 'I had my contacts in and I would take my goggles off and show them how to go underwater and how fun it was. My eye started to bother me pretty quickly'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her life-changing diagnosis, Cronin was hospitalized at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York on August 7 for 48 days before undergoing a cornea transplant in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped front layer of the eye that covers the iris and pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a transplant, the damaged part of the cornea is replaced with healthy donor's cornea using tiny stiches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her eye rejected the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now almost completely blind in her right eye and waiting to undergo a second cornea transplant to restore some of her vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Disturbing pictures show her once light blue eye now cloudy and with an enlarged pupil caused by the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cronin said of her diagnosis: 'I'm blind now in this eye with everything so it is very upsetting, it's isolating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't want to meet any new people, it gives me anxiety and I worry about what people think when they see my eye. I now have a fear of being near any kind of water. I shower with my goggles on.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing her first transplant surgery on September 23, Cronin revealed that doctors also found 'high levels of parasitic activity' in her cornea that had to be immediately removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a result, she is now almost completely blind in her right eye and is waiting to undergo a second cornea transplant to restore some of her vision&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cronin has worn contact lenses for nearly 20 years and claims she was never told to not wear them in the pool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cronin claims to have worn contact lenses for nearly 20 years and was never told not to wear them in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now raising awareness about her AK diagnosis in a bid to warn others about wearing lenses around water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am hopeful but fearful at the same time [about the next cornea transplant]. I'm afraid it won't take. It feels like it's never ending and I'm nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'AK is not well known and it is often misdiagnosed.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryv001h3b73jhj6dcwz@published"&gt;I had a pregnancy that ended in a tough miscarriage. It took many months to get over (to the extent that anyone truly gets over a miscarriage). But now, I’m pregnant again, and it’s at the point where I’m starting to tell friends.  I’m so excited to have good news to share and delight in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001i3b73jlsp5tui@published"&gt;The problem is this: one of my friends who has been a huge support to me on this journey recently shared with me that &lt;em&gt;yet another &lt;/em&gt;round of IVF had failed for her and her partner. I feel terrible, and have no idea how to tell her I’m pregnant. She’s been trying longer than I have, and I know from experience how tough it can be to hear someone’s good news when you’re struggling with your own baby journey. (That it can be “tough” feels like a huge understatement, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001j3b73gp7ht3g2@published"&gt;I can put it off for a while. We don’t text a lot, and I’m not showing yet. This is a friend I see every month or so for a big catch-up session, and the last time we hung out I simply didn’t say anything about where I was with pregnancy, and kept the conversation on other things in my life, and on what she’s going through with IVF.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001k3b73xn5rlues@published"&gt;But I can’t keep it a secret forever! I don’t want to suddenly show up with a giant baby bump at one of our hangs. But I have no idea how to share the news without potentially making her sad, which I deeply do not want to do. I’ve been through a lot, but she’s been through so much more, and I feel like if things were “fair” she’d be pregnant first!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryw001n3b73itpse4c2@published"&gt;As someone who has been the long-trying IVF person whose friend gets pregnant, I’m sorry to say, she is going to be sad. And that’s okay! The thing about dealing with infertility is, you know other people are going to have kids. It’s kind of unavoidable. You’re going to see adorable children in the grocery store and cry in your car. You’re going to be asked by random people when you’re going to have children (side note to all readers never, ever, ask anyone this question. It’s none of your business). And you’re for sure going to know people who get pregnant while you are trying to have a baby. It’s extremely hard and it really sucks. But what people who are going through infertility &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;want is to be left out of good things because of our infertility. That just makes us feel even more ostracized than we already do.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryx001o3b73mf2ebpxz@published"&gt;When this happened to me, my friend—who had also been having trouble conceiving—called me up and said, “I love you, I know this might be hard to hear, but I’m pregnant.” You need to do this with your friend. Either on the phone or in person, if you are telling people, you need to tell her. Now. It will be so much worse if she hears it first from someone else, or finds out super late in your pregnancy and realizes you’ve been keeping it from her.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryx001p3b739xf5k0b0@published"&gt;So yes, your friend will probably be sad, and maybe she’ll cry later, but she will also be so SO happy for you! It’s not a contest about who can get pregnant first and it doesn’t matter who has struggled more with getting pregnant. How this stuff unfolds is to some extent just random. What matters now is that you don’t expel your friend from this really happy moment in your life, just because she’s not there yet. She will probably be happy for you! And any sad feelings she has aren’t really about you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7c4oryx001q3b73ocyuh8js@published"&gt;One thing you can do is before you send out baby shower invitations, just give her a heads up for what is coming in her mailbox. It would also be great if you let her know that if she would rather the two of you just do a little something to celebrate, rather than have her come to a big baby party, that that would be okay. Honestly, those parties are kinda the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

It was our second pregnancy (we have an 11-month-old) and we hadn’t told anyone but my mother-in-law, who saw an ultrasound at our house by mistake. We were waiting to tell everyone after our anatomy scan at 20 weeks. The pregnancy was unplanned, but very welcome. I’m devastated, as is my husband. I was so glad we’d only told his mother, as it means not having to tell everyone about the loss. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/12/miscarriage-loss-privacy-mother-in-law-support.html"&gt;The problem is that my mother-in-law is very public with her feelings and issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That is, in part, because around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6396775/#:~:text=Pancreatic%20cancer%20is%20mostly%20diagnosed,several%20reasons%20because%20this%20occurs." target="_blank"&gt;90% of cases&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed when the disease is already advanced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pancreatic cancer cells also spread to other parts of the body much earlier on than in other cancers, which typically spread only when the original tumors are large. The disease typically doesn’t cause symptoms until later stages and there isn’t a routine screening for this cancer, such as a mammogram or colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Once it’s detected, there are few effective treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Although we have made significant progress in improving outcomes in many of the other cancers with newer waves of cancer treatments, these have not had much of an impact in pancreatic cancer,” said Dr. Vinod Balachandran, director of the Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who led the trial. “Survival rate has remained about 10% despite our best current treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That highlights the desperate need for more options, he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before mRNA vaccines became widely used for Covid, researchers had already been developing the technology for cancer treatment. This version of the vaccines teaches a person’s immune system to recognize and attack tumors, turning the immune system into a cancer-fighting machine. mRNA technology is currently being explored for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccine-melanoma-reduces-relapse-therapy-trial-shows-rcna79543" target="_blank"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccines-frontier-cancer-treatment-rcna8886" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other solid tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To be effective, mRNA cancer vaccines have to produce a lot of T cells, a type of immune cell that protects the body against invaders. These T cells also need to last a long time in cancer patients and retain their ability to detect and fight off cancer cells. While this is a relatively straightforward feat when it comes to viruses, teaching a person’s T cells to fight nonforeign cells that their body itself made is much more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For pancreatic cancer, the task is monumental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For a vaccine to teach the body to recognize tumors, there have to be targets on those tumor cells that are unique, meaning they don’t appear elsewhere in the body. Since tumors are created from mutations, these mutations, expressed as proteins on the surface of cancer cells, serve as the targets. Pancreatic cancers typically do not have many targets to choose from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s been a widespread belief that this lack of mutations, which serve as targets for an mRNA cancer vaccine, would make pancreatic cancer a poor choice for the therapy. But the new study showed that assumption may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial was a longer follow-up to an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06063-y" target="_blank"&gt;initial 2023 trial&lt;/a&gt; that first tested the efficacy of the vaccines in a subset of people with pancreatic cancer. Phase 1 clinical trials are very early stages of research and are meant to determine whether a certain treatment is safe and shows promise of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial included 16 patients with receptacle pancreatic cancer, meaning a surgeon can remove the tumors. This is a relatively rare occurrence in pancreatic cancer — &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-treatment.html#:~:text=Surgery%20is%20the%20only%20treatment,it%20may%20provide%20clinical%20benefit." target="_blank"&gt;only about 20%&lt;/a&gt; of pancreatic cancers are operable, which is the only treatment that can stop this type of cancer. Chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapies can shrink tumors or keep them from growing, but are not considered cures. In an even smaller percentage of people, surgery is possible without first shrinking the tumors with chemotherapy, Wolpin said. The cancer returns about half of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Balachandran and his team followed the 16 patients in the trial for up to four years. The participants first had their tumors removed sometime between 2019 and 2021. Then, the team used genetic material from each person’s tumors to design personalized mRNA vaccines they hoped would teach the patients’ immune systems to attack their cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to the vaccine, all 16 people were also treated with the current standard of care — surgery, chemotherapy and an immunotherapy drug called atezolizumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Half of the people in the study — eight of the participants — responded to the vaccine, producing T cells that targeted their tumors. The other half didn’t respond to the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One of the most important aspects of using a person’s immune system to fight their cancer is ensuring their response —in this case, the cancer-fighting T cells — have longevity. That way, they stay in the body, fighting off cancer cells that pop up, rather than only working for a short amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the people in the trial who did mount a response, the vaccine would give their cancer-fighting T cells an average lifespan of nearly eight years, the researchers estimated. They believe that about 20% of the T cells could potentially survive and function for decades.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The longer the T cells survive, the better to protect against the cancer’s return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Early trials are meant to test whether or not a treatment is feasible — in this case, if an mRNA vaccine for pancreatic cancer could produce durable T cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The findings suggest that it can. However, it’s still unknown whether these T cells will extend a person’s life and if so, by how much –– that is a task for the next phases of trials. Just two of the patients who had a response to the vaccine had their cancer return during the three-year follow- up, compared to seven of the eight who did not respond to the vaccine treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You have to take this with a little perspective, this is not treating hundreds of thousands of people,” said Dr. Brian Wolpin, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “The fact that they were able to use a vaccine to generate a response to new mutations that come up in the tumors, and then were able to show that this subsists, is promising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Because pancreatic cancer cells are adept at spreading early on, some organs may be harboring undetectable cancer cells that don’t show up on scans, meaning these tumors aren’t treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With vaccines, the immune system may be able to kill these cancer cells, as well as new ones that pop up, said Dr. Shubham Pant, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Very early on in pancreatic cancer development, “cells can escape and set up shop somewhere else –– in the liver or in the lungs. They may be quietly sitting in those other organs and then come back,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite the caveat of being a small group of patients and a very early trial, Pant said, the results are encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other research teams, including scientists at MD Anderson, are working on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02760-3" target="_blank"&gt;off-the-shelf mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for pancreatic cancer, meaning the vaccines have a target that is common in all pancreatic cancer tumors, rather than a personalized target based on a person’s individual tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About 90% of pancreatic cancer cases include a mutation called KRAS, meaning nonpersonalized vaccines, which could be produced in bulk and would not require a piece of a person’s tumor to create, could potentially be another option down the road. (These vaccines are also currently in very early stages of research). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This gives us a little more confidence that once you get a T cell response, that it could be durable, it’s not a shock response,” Pant said. “If we can see this response stand up in bigger trials, that’s really significant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:22:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQV0JKOWtfVndITnlPTVgzbkU0Nm0tV21HZWNqc0NYLWJacVBGdENyakdaby1HXzNzRlRLaEFJUTRNdklvN2xYSUNsZmtlOFQ2RUlfTHNRMVllUG9OVHFNN2dDcEdkY2FoaUY5WmtYM0FpNXdSWk5WU1VLbWUzZDNMQTdHZkh4b2x4TUhYZzFOM0tvalpWS0xjQm40TdIBVkFVX3lxTE0wRXBpdmQyMHNfYnNEdVVhMWg4LXA0ODlxbVN4ZDRIenBUd0l6Q05XNUNtOTlMM090N2VNQ0JucE9QUXVJTU80ZVB3V0xaN0JLa1BkMWFR</guid></item><item><title>Why Am I so Tired All the Time?

&lt;p&gt;Not to toot my own horn, but I like to think I live a pretty healthy, balanced lifestyle for a &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/what-to-know-about-perimenopause-in-20s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gal in her early 20s&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, I get McDonald’s delivered at the end of a night out most weekends, and sometimes I skip Pilates and pay the no-show fee to binge-watch old seasons of &lt;em&gt;RuPaul’s Drag Race &lt;/em&gt;instead. But in general, I do my best to stick to a sleep schedule, eat well, and work out a few times a week. Despite all that effort, I’m still always exhausted. I’ve lived with chronic fatigue for years, brushing it off as normal—even when I could fall asleep at a party or standing up like a horse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m 23 and have come to realize I shouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/coffee-nap-for-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the energy levels&lt;/a&gt; of an 80-year-old. So, I turned to &lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/LKnz9Z"&gt;Labcorp OnDemand&lt;/a&gt; for answers. Their micronutrient test measures three vitamins (vitamin D, vitamin B12, and folate) and three minerals (magnesium, iodine, and zinc) in the blood. Micronutrients can impact energy levels, and results from this blood test can help guide lifestyle changes. Was this finally going to clue me in on the causes of my chronic fatigue? It was time to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-chronic-fatigue"&gt;What is chronic fatigue?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from being able to fall asleep anytime, anywhere, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;other symptoms of chronic fatigue&lt;/a&gt; have crept their way into my life. I’ve also experienced brain fog, frequent dizziness, unrefreshing sleep (regardless of my trusty melatonin and white noise machine), and my muscles becoming sore very quickly. It’s important to note that everyone is different, and chronic fatigue doesn’t have just one cause. It can stem from factors like nutrient deficiencies, hormone imbalances, stress, poor sleep, or other underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reflecting on my symptoms, possible causes, and lifestyle choices, I decided the Labcorp OnDemand Micronutrient Test could provide some insight on what might be behind my daily exhaustion. The test provides detailed levels of key micronutrients I might not be getting enough of. With that in mind, I decided to give Labcorp OnDemand a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-labcorp-ondemand"&gt;What is Labcorp OnDemand?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/LKnz9Z"&gt;Labcorp OnDemand&lt;/a&gt; allows you to purchase lab testing without the hassle of needing a doctor’s appointment, so you can get insights into your health on your own time. I know I’m not the only one who’s had to wait months just to get in with my doctor for a routine check-up, so this is a major game-changer. &lt;strong&gt;However, remember that a Labcorp OnDemand test is not a substitute for consulting a provider, and you should always speak with a healthcare professional regarding your results.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you’re focused on improving your energy like me, optimizing nutrition, or reaching fitness milestones, Labcorp OnDemand can offer health tests designed to give you insights that will help you make this year your healthiest yet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With over 70 tests available, including hormonal, nutritional, and more, you can find a test fit for your needs and concerns. Scheduling an appointment for bloodwork is insanely easy, too—choose whatever test is best for you and purchase online, walk in, or make an appointment at one of Labcorp’s 2,000+ patient service centers nationwide for a sample collection, and get notified via email once your results are ready. And as if the ease wasn’t incentive enough, you can &lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/LKnz9Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use code EVERYGIRL to get 20% off your first test purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-my-experience-with-labcorp-ondemand-s-micronutrient-test"&gt;My experience with Labcorp OnDemand’s Micronutrient Test&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: My experience with Labcorp OnDemand was seamless and genuinely insightful (thank God). I purchased my micronutrient test online, got an appointment for a few days later at a Labcorp location that was a 15-minute walk from my apartment, was in and out of my sample collection within 20 minutes, and was notified that my results were ready via email three days later. I’m quite the busy bee, so having access to a service that took barely any time at all was a huge win. It is, without a doubt, the easiest healthcare experience I’ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the best part of it all? I actually gained helpful information from my micronutrient test. In fact, I learned I have a prominent iodine deficiency. Upon doing some research as to what this meant, I was met with the answers I’d been looking for: &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/services/conditions/iodine-deficiency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Common symptoms of iodine deficiency&lt;/a&gt; include fatigue, muscle weakness, and memory difficulties (AKA brain fog). I also resonated with other symptoms of iodine deficiency not directly correlated with my exhaustion concerns, such as heavy/irregular periods and hair thinning. Now that I have this information, I can visit my primary care physician and learn about my options for increasing my iodine levels. This was my first step in addressing my chronic fatigue, and it’s super relieving to know there are potential answers with solutions on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-results-from-labcorp-ondemand"&gt;More results from Labcorp OnDemand&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For both moral support and my own curiosity, I convinced a few coworkers to take the micronutrient test with me. Here’s what they found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The only veggies I eat come from my abuela’s sofrito, so I expected alarming results. Turns out, my only issue was low vitamin D, likely from lack of sun. Prolonged deficiency can lead to bone and muscle weakness, so I’ve added more vitamin D-rich foods—and yes, some extra veggies—just to be safe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kaia-grobe-video-content-editor"&gt;Kaia Grobe, Video Content Editor&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t usually struggle with fatigue, but as winter rolled in and the days got darker, I noticed a dip in my energy, mood, and even some hair loss. It wasn’t surprising when my Labcorp OnDemand results showed a vitamin D deficiency. Since sunny days are rare during a Wisconsin winter, I’ve started eating more vitamin D-rich foods and taking a high-quality supplement recommended by my doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-allyson-trammell-editor-in-chief"&gt;Allyson Trammell, Editor-in-Chief&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been trying to conceive for two years and taking prenatal vitamins almost daily, so I didn’t think my fatigue could be from a deficiency. I was shocked when my test results showed my vitamin D levels were in the red zone. Low vitamin D can contribute to fatigue and low mood, both of which I’ve felt. I’m excited to add a new vitamin to my routine and see if it helps!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-labcorp-ondemand-tests-i-want-to-try-next"&gt;The Labcorp OnDemand tests I want to try next&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a successful first trial, there are a few more Labcorp OnDemand tests I would love to take in order to gain insight into some more of my health and nutrition woes. After moseying through their test selection, here are a few that caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://labcorp.sjv.io/DyQW7y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Women’s Health Test&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;This comprehensive test offers insights into overall wellness, helping identify if you might be at risk for common concerns like diabetes, heart disease, hormone imbalances, thyroid dysfunction, and more. As a woman, this feels like an essential next step.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/zx2gke"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete Heart Health Test:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An expanded heart health test measures key indicators of cardiovascular and metabolic health to help you understand your risk of cardiovascular disease and developing Type 2 diabetes.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://labcorp.sjv.io/RG10ey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Standard Thyroid Test&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; After learning my iodine deficiency might be linked to thyroid dysfunction, this test feels like a natural next move. It screens for conditions like hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, which are common concerns for women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-i-m-recommending-labcorp-ondemand-to-everyone-i-know"&gt;Why I’m recommending Labcorp OnDemand to everyone I know&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I went several years too long doing absolutely zilch for my chronic fatigue. But thanks to Labcorp OnDemand being so efficient (seriously, I cannot emphasize enough how easy the whole process was) and insightful, I’m confidently headed in the right direction of feeling how a healthy, functional 20-something is supposed to. No more unwarranted yawning at pregames in 2025! Woo!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me and want to really tackle adulting by taking control of your health concerns and curiosities, I can’t recommend Labcorp OnDemand enough. You deserve to feel your best, girl! Let this be the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s just something very pure about their affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is particularly true of rescue dogs. These sweet canine companions have had to go through some difficult things in life, so when they find a loving, caring owner who gives them a forever home, they are particularly grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can absolutely feel it in this video, where an adorable rescue puppy named Cactus hugs his dad like he is a little human. We are warning you: this video is so precious that it will make your heart melt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;OMG! Cactus is such a sweet, loving boy! We are so happy to see that he has such a loving dad. It’s just so heartwarming to see him giving this type of affection to his human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though we are sure Cactus is a very affectionate pup, trying to express those feelings isn’t always easy. In the video, he made multiple attempts to hug his human dad before landing the perfect hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Cactus’ first attempt to hug his dad, he aimed a little low, and his paw landed on his dad’s lap. It was a good first attempt, but it didn’t quite communicate the love and gratitude that Cactus likely intended it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/rescue-dog-finds-soulmate-pharmacy-014500699.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Rescue Dog Finds Soulmate in Pharmacy and Proves True Love Can Strike Anywhere;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Rescue Dog Finds Soulmate in Pharmacy and Proves True Love Can Strike Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His second attempt was a success. Cactus managed to get his paw high enough to land around his dad’s arms as he rested his head on his chest. As this adorable boy nuzzled into his father’s chest, his human expressed his own loving gratitude for this affection and return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Aww… Are you giving me a hug,” his human dad asked. Upon realizing that’s exactly what cactus was doing, he added, “Oh, your sweet boy.” Yes, he certainly is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Internet was completely smitten with Cactus and his loving little hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people, such as TikTok user Melanie CA, were so overcome with emotion upon seeing this video that we could practically hear them weeping through their keyboard. They wrote, “Cactus is everything that is good and pure in this world!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other people, like TikTok user GDiddy1981, comment on how much Cactus loved his human dad when they wrote, “He sure loves his dad. Isn’t that the best feeling?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Bonding With a Rescue Dog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rescue dogs can be uncomfortable and distant with their new humans at first. While every rescue dog will be different, &lt;a href="https://www.rescuedogs101.com/how-to-bond-with-your-dog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forming a strong bond;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;forming a strong bond&lt;/a&gt; with them will take time. Keep in mind that these dogs often come from unstable backgrounds and that humans have not always been kind to them. It is only natural that they will be hesitant to trust their new family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That is why it is important to earn your dog’s trust. You can do this by giving them plenty of space so that they do not feel pressured by you. Part of this also means learning to understand their body language so that you know how comfortable they are at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking them for walks, offering them plenty of &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/dogs/top-10-homemade-dog-treat-recipes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tasty treats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tasty treats&lt;/a&gt;, and playing fun games with them will help you build a strong, loving bond with your dog over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more PetHelpful updates?

              &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, may also help people wean themselves off cocaine. A new case paper this week details a man whose cravings for cocaine significantly declined after he started taking semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctor Vincenzo Maria Romeo wrote about the case, &lt;a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-025-05049-w"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Case Reports&lt;/em&gt;. Romeo’s patient, a 54-year-old man living in Italy, suffered from cocaine use disorder and obesity, both of which were treated successfully once he began taking semaglutide. The findings further bolster the idea that this class of medication can also be used to reduce people’s unhealthy dependence on drugs like cocaine and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and other newer GLP-1 drugs are known to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drugs-future-uses-1851116318"&gt;be far more effective&lt;/a&gt; at helping people lose weight or treating their type 2 diabetes than diet and exercise alone. Since their arrival, some doctors have begun to notice another possible but positive side effect of GLP-1 therapy: some of their patients have reported a declining urge to abuse recreational drugs or indulge in other potentially harmful compulsive behaviors like gambling or binge drinking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies of this phenomenon have largely focused on alcohol and opioids. But when Romeo’s patient visited him with a history of cocaine abuse and obesity, he and his clinical team saw an ideal opportunity to see whether semaglutide could alleviate both conditions at once. With his patient’s consent, Romeo started him on a 12-week course of the GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;By the end of the 12 weeks, the man had lost around 12% of his body weight, in line with typical results (10% to 15% average weight loss in trials). But he also experienced a 59% reduction in his symptoms of cocaine craving, based on a commonly used &lt;a href="https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/instrument/cocaine-craving-questionnaire-brief"&gt;survey measurement&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, the man reported improved physical health, including feeling more energetic and having less joint pain, with only mild adverse effects like gastrointestinal symptoms early on in treatment (a common occurrence with GLP-1 drugs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is, of course, only a single case study. Overall, the research looking into GLP-1 therapy for substance use disorders is also very preliminary. Researchers aren’t exactly sure how GLP-1 drugs reduce cravings for substances and compulsive behaviors, though it’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272#:~:text=As%20it%20turns,like%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s."&gt;suspected&lt;/a&gt; that GLP-1 receptors in the brain help regulate our response to potentially addictive stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But the evidence for this unintended effect being genuine is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-case-for-ozempic-as-a-addiction-treatment-keeps-getting-better-2000513096"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;. Just last week, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/health/ozempic-alcohol-use-disorder-trial/index.html"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; findings from the first controlled clinical trial testing semaglutide for alcohol dependence; it found that people with moderate alcohol use disorder taking low-dose semaglutide experienced a significantly greater drop in cravings and drinks consumed than those on a placebo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will take more time and research to confirm the value of GLP-1 therapy for drug dependence, including studies looking directly at cocaine abuse. But for people like Romeo’s patient, experiencing obesity and a substance use disorder at the same time, semaglutide could very well be established as a potent treatment for both conditions in the near future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that semaglutide may be a promising therapeutic option for the management of substance abuse in patients with comorbid obesity,” Romeo wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

It stays glued to the surface of the inner lining of blood vessels.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From diet soda to zero-sugar ice cream, artificial sweeteners have been touted as a guilt-free way to indulge our sweet tooth. However, new research &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00006-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt; shows that aspartame, one of the most common sugar substitutes, may impact vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The team of cardiovascular health experts and clinicians found that aspartame triggers increased &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin levels&lt;/a&gt; in animals, which in turn contributes to atherosclerosis—buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which can lead to higher levels of inflammation and an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was inspired by a can of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diet+soda/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diet soda&lt;/a&gt; during a project meeting. "One of my students was sipping on this sugar-free drink, and I said, 'Why don't you look into that?'" recalls senior author Yihai Cao, who studies &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; related to blood vessel disorders at Karolinska Institute in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has linked consumption of sugar substitutes to increased chronic disorders like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, the mechanisms involved were previously unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers fed mice daily doses of food containing 0.15% aspartame for 12 weeks—an amount that corresponds to consuming about three cans of diet soda each day for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to mice without a sweetener-infused diet, aspartame-fed mice developed larger and more fatty plaques in their arteries and exhibited higher levels of inflammation, both of which are hallmarks of compromised cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;When the team analyzed the mice's blood, they found a surge in insulin levels after aspartame entered their system. The team noted that this wasn't a surprising result, given that our mouths, intestines, and other tissues are lined with sweetness-detecting receptors that help guide insulin release. But aspartame, 200 times sweeter than sugar, seemed to trick the receptors into releasing more insulin.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then demonstrated that the mice's elevated insulin levels fueled the growth of fatty plaques in the mice's arteries, suggesting that insulin may be the key link between aspartame and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they investigated how exactly elevated insulin levels lead to arterial plaque buildup and identified an immune signal called CX3CL1 that is especially active under insulin stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because blood flow through the artery is strong and robust, most chemicals would be quickly washed away as the heart pumps," says Cao. "Surprisingly, not CX3CL1. It stays glued to the surface of the inner lining of blood vessels. There, it acts like a bait, catching immune cells as they pass by."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these trapped immune cells are known to stoke blood vessel inflammation. However, when researchers eliminated CX3CL1 receptors from one of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; in aspartame-fed mice, the harmful plaque buildup didn't occur. These results point to CX3CL1's role in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/aspartame/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;aspartame&lt;/a&gt;'s effects on the arteries, says Cao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Cao and his team plan to verify their findings in humans. Cao also foresees CX3CL1 as a potential target for chronic conditions beyond cardiovascular disease, given that blood vessel inflammation is involved in stroke, arthritis, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Artificial sweeteners have penetrated almost all kinds of food, so we have to know the long-term health impact," says Cao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all artificial sweeteners are created &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073617?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A new study out of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; reports that one of the most popular sugar substitutes — found in diet drinks, chewing gum and low-sugar yogurt — increases insulin levels in animals, potentially elevating their risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/health/61-of-us-adults-will-have-cardiovascular-disease-by-2050-report/"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/health/how-to-prevent-a-stroke-stroke-association-issues-new-advice/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of my students was sipping on this sugar-free drink, and I said, ‘Why don’t you look into that?’” recalled senior study author Yihai Cao, who studies chronic diseases related to blood vessel disorders at the Karolinska Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Some research has suggested that long-term use of artificial sweeteners may heighten the risk of stroke, heart disease and even death. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;lovelyday12 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucihealth.org/blog/2022/09/sugar-substitutes-may-boost-heart-disease-stroke-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Some research has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that long-term use of artificial sweeteners may heighten &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/health/erythritol-sweetener-linked-to-increased-heart-attack-risk/"&gt;the risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and even premature death. Cao’s team wanted to explore exactly how the sugar substitute &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/29/diet-coke-sweetener-aspartame-is-possible-carcinogen-leaked-report/"&gt;aspartame&lt;/a&gt; might cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aspartame, which is about &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;200 times sweeter than sugar&lt;/a&gt;, is sold under the brand names Nutrasweet, Equal and Sugar Twin.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Aspartame, which is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, is sold under the brand names Nutrasweet, Equal and Sugar Twin. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO)’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2023-aspartame-hazard-and-risk-assessment-results-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;classified aspartame&lt;/a&gt; as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the new study, mice were fed food containing 0.15% aspartame every day for 12 weeks — that’s the equivalent of humans drinking about three daily cans of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/14/lifestyle/diet-coke-or-coke-zero-dietitian-reveals-healthiest-option/"&gt;diet soda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aspartame-fed mice developed larger and more fatty plaques in their arteries and experienced higher levels of inflammation, a major contributor to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cao’s team blamed elevated insulin levels for the arterial plaque buildup, also known as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/10/health/mini-health-condition-is-more-serious-than-doctors-thought/"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;These photos from the study show that aspartame-fed mice (right) developed larger and more plaques (red) in their arteries (pink) compared to mice that didn’t consume the sweetener. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Wu et al., Cell Metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers determined that the immune signal CX3CL1 is especially active under insulin stimulation.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because blood flow through the artery is strong and robust, most chemicals would be quickly washed away as the heart pumps,” Cao explained. “Surprisingly, not CX3CL1. It stays glued to the surface of the inner lining of blood vessels. There, it acts like a bait, catching immune cells as they pass by.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cao said many of these trapped immune cells are known to fuel blood vessel inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When the researchers removed CX3CL1 receptors from one of the immune cells in aspartame-fed mice, the plaque accumulation didn’t occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00006-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Wednesday in the journal Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Cao’s team plans to verify these results in humans and further target CX3CL1 since blood vessel inflammation can lead to stroke, arthritis and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Artificial sweeteners have penetrated almost all kinds of food, so we have to know the long-term health impact,” Cao said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/health/the-healthiest-thanksgiving-foods-according-to-a-dietitian-nutritionist/"&gt;Stephanie Schiff&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Huntington Hospital, recommends cutting artificial sweeteners and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/29/health/cut-sugar-from-your-diet-to-lower-your-biological-age-study/"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; from your diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are diabetic and find you have trouble avoiding sugary beverages, consider the sweeteners allulose, monk fruit and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2017/07/13/stevia-is-the-best-treatment-for-lyme-disease-researchers-say/"&gt;stevia&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/health/erythritol-sweetener-linked-to-increased-heart-attack-risk/"&gt;erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, a commonly used artificial sweetener that has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, try sweetening your food with fruit — or get used to consuming foods and drinks that are less sweet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never seen a single study that concluded that increasing sugar or artificial sweetener intake was healthy,” Schiff told The Post. “It’s worth making changes in your diet to stay healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS — The latest statewide report on influenza shows Missouri has joined much of the country with very high levels of the virus as states battle one of the worst flu seasons in the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s flu season started a bit late, with cases increasing around the end of December, then appearing to drop, &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/influenza/dashboard.php" target="_blank"&gt;data shows&lt;/a&gt;. But around mid-January, cases began to dramatically increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It looked like it might have been possible it was going to be a mild flu season, but flu had something else in mind,” said Dr. Steven Lawrence, a Washington University infectious disease specialist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. “It really came back with a vengeance and has somewhat exploded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three weeks, reported cases of influenza tripled in Missouri from 5,086 reported the week ending Jan. 11, to 15,360 the week ending Feb. 1, data shows. The week ending Feb. 8, the latest data available, shows just a slight dip to 14,272 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of emergency department visits due to influenza-like illnesses is still on the rise across Missouri, going from 2% a few weeks ago to 4.6% the week ending Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://it.stlouiscountymo.gov/st-louis-county-departments/public-health/health-data-and-statistics/communicable-disease-reports/influenza-reports/influenza-weekly-report" target="_blank"&gt;The St. Louis County Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; said between 51 and 90 people a day sought care in emergency departments across the county for influenza-like illnesses — at times more than 5% of emergency visits — during the week ending Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the state, more than one in every three tests for flu in Missouri (35%) came back positive that week. BJC HealthCare hospitals across the St. Louis area &lt;a href="https://diorama.wustl.edu/weekly-report" target="_blank"&gt;also report&lt;/a&gt; a similar positivity rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools in mid-Missouri &lt;a href="https://www.komu.com/news/midmissourinews/flu-like-illness-shuts-down-some-schools-in-columbia/article_1bcdf140-e4cd-11ef-b700-872525228fb9.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported having to cancel classes&lt;/a&gt; the first week of February, and the St. Louis County health department reported a flu outbreak at a small private school where “control measures have been implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this season, 97 deaths from influenza have been reported in Missouri, data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really to the point now where it’s the busiest, most aggressive, bad flu season since the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic,” Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there have been at least 29 million illnesses, 370,000 hospitalizations, and 16,000 deaths from flu so far this season. A total of 68 of those deaths were among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu has landed more people in the hospital in a week this season than at any time since the 2010-2011 season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. This flu season is now classified as a “high severity season” for all age groups — the first since 2017-2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some signs show a slight drop in transmission in the virus, Lawrence said experts need to see several weeks of dropping numbers before knowing if the worst is behind us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a little early to know if it’s peaked yet,” he said. “We have to be careful not to jump the gun and declare that the peak is passed because, like what happened at the beginning of the year, it fooled us. We thought it was going back down, and it just popped right back up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the peak has passed, cases will take several weeks to return to low levels, Lawrence said. It’s not too late to get vaccinated. Experts recommend that everyone aged 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no question that we’re still going to have a lot of flu transmission and potential exposures to flu over the next month at least,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at higher risk — such as pregnant women, and those over age 65 or with chronic health conditions — are urged to seek care within a couple days of experiencing flu symptoms in order to get prescription antiviral drugs that can help prevent severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint why some flu seasons are worse than others, Lawrence said. Many factors come into play, such as the weather, vaccination rates and how well-matched the circulating strains of the flu are to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccination rates drop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence said the flu vaccine is not a good match this year, and vaccination rates have also dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic in Missouri and across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data shows&lt;/a&gt; that so far this season, 42.5% of Missouri children received their flu vaccine. That is compared to 57.2% in 2019-2020. Similar trends were seen nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults ages 18 and older in Missouri, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adult-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;data shows&lt;/a&gt; 43.7% received their flu vaccine this season, compared to 47.1% last season, the only previous season available. Lawrence said numbers were usually over 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sarah George, professor of infectious diseases at St. Louis University, said people who do not see a doctor regularly tend to miss out on getting a flu shot. The focus has also been on vaccinating against COVID-19, which was killing more people than flu until just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think vaccination rates may be down slightly just because people are, if you will, ‘shotted out’ after COVID and all the boosters and what not,” George said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed flu data from the St. Louis County health department shows that the hardest-hit age group is between ages 0 to 9, with the number of cases reported in that group nearly double that of those in next hardest-hit demographic — those in their 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is typical, since children tend to spend lots of time in close contact with others in day care and classrooms, Lawrence said. “They’re very much the reservoir for which it maintains transmission in the community, and then the source of the infection for many others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;George urged people to stay home from work if sick, and don’t send a sick child to school or day care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that’s not always easy to do when parents have to work,” she said. “But try and interrupt the chain of transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-video  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-video tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;p class="tnt-video-container" data-provider="field59" data-projection=""&gt;&lt;video crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none" playsinline controls="controls" poster="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/4d/d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba/67956410c4c6c.image.jpg" id="video-player-d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba" class="tnt-video video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-big-play-centered vjs-16-9" data-uuid="d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba" data-title="US Faces 'Quad-Demic' as Flu, COVID, RSV, and Norovirus Surge, Straining Hospitals" data-provider="field59" data-duration="58" data-visible="false" data-premium="1" data-vast-url="https://tv.springserve.com/vast/850323?w=640&amp;amp;h=480&amp;amp;cb=%%timestamp%%&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stltoday.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fmetro%2Fvideo_d4d4f679-7292-55de-9326-f141b9aa7cba.html&amp;amp;dnt=0"&gt;&lt;source src="https://redirect.field59.com/video/36e1702ba0c8e861a32ca3c0f945050d3618a24a.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source src="https://redirect.field59.com/video/36e1702ba0c8e861a32ca3c0f945050d3618a24a.m3u8" type="application/vnd.apple.mpegurl"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source src="https://redirect.field59.com/video/36e1702ba0c8e861a32ca3c0f945050d3618a24a.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=" multimedia-inline-figcaption"&gt;

Dad thought it was too cold to swim (it's one of Ziggy's favorite things to do!) since it was only 30 degrees out and freezing rain was falling, but that didn't stop Ziggy from wanting to get in his pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;15-year-old Ziggy almost lost his life last year, and in the video, his dad explained that since then, they agreed to do whatever they could to make him happy. Apparently, that means swimming even though they were freezing! But how can dad say no to that cute face!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This video is just too cute and so heartwarming! &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ziggysrefuge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ziggy's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ziggy's&lt;/a&gt; dad is the best for braving it out for him. I know I wouldn't be able to stay in that water for long! The water was a warm 75 degrees, but since it was so cold outside, it probably made the water feel like an ice bath! I love what Ziggy's dad said in his caption, "Crazy looks like devotion. Crazy looks like worshiping the animals who have changed our lives and dedicating ourselves to ensuring they experience nothing but kindness, safety, and joy. If that makes me crazy, then crazy looks a lot like love."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Viewers also loved the sweet video. @jgl.fitness shared, "Awww he's cold plunging, probably helps his joints, boosts his mood and sleep better." @szbrittain4 added, "I had no doubt in my mind that if King Ziggy wanted to swim, he'd get his way. He was motoring around pretty darn well!" @ashley.chapman.andthe.strays said what we were all thinking, "Not crazy! Fantastic parents! Love all this love!!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/fascinating-reasons-pigs-love-mud-163000257.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Fascinating Reasons Pigs Love Mud All Come Down to Pure Instinct;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Fascinating Reasons Pigs Love Mud All Come Down to Pure Instinct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;More About Pigs as Pets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ziggy is more than just a pet; he's part of the family. Like his dad, most of us feel like our pets are a part of our family and can't imagine life without them. If after watching this video you are wondering if &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/farm-pets/How-To-Decide-If-A-Pet-Pig-Is-Right-For-You" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pigs make good pets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pigs make good pets&lt;/a&gt;, they certainly do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who have pet pigs say it's a lot like having a pet dog. Pigs are extremely intelligent, social, love to cuddle, get along well with other animals, and are entertaining to have around. Like dogs and other animals, pigs even &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/baby-goats-irresistible-case-zoomies-024916493.html" data-ylk="slk:get the zoomies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;get the zoomies&lt;/a&gt; sometimes. They do this when they are happy, to express emotions, and even if they're feeling stressed or anxious. Though Ziggy might be too old to run around like that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pigs are hypoallergenic, making them a great pet choice for people who have allergies. Although they get a bad rap for being dirty, pet pigs are actually very clean and with regular baths, they don't get stinky. Pigs &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/exotic-pets/How-to-House-BreakTrain-a-Micro-Mini-Pig" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:can even be potty trained,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;can even be potty trained,&lt;/a&gt; and you can train them to use a litter box if they live inside the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One thing to know about pigs is that they love to root. Rooting is a natural behavior that all pigs do to look for food, to cool off, and even as a source of comfort. Unless you want them rooting around in your carpet, they'll need someplace to do it outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like with any pet, do your research to learn all about them before bringing them home to see if you can meet their needs and if they fit in with your family's lifestyle to avoid being unhappy with your new pet (or them with you!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOQldNVGNucTR1Ukl4OTBGSnNVY2Q0SklsUldOTzFELUVmX3pydkZaR3JQeVMyZEd4UFZHa2FFRkdvZUNGQWVZQkUzbVhrM1ZXWlJrV1BXaGpnbzRnakhLaV8zOFotdm5pczQ3TmxFbmp6MGVtRlVRTTV6QXhDSUlLT1gyLWZ4Zw</guid></item><item><title>First-line Ocrevus may aid early relapsing MS long-term outcomes - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxPY2Y1OXZmNDFobnliOWlGYjl3aDFLcW1XbHNQTU9sN1E3bnRWNmhGT2ZTZ3BXX3ZxVVd2cW5vUktKRU5NV3YybUdZblcxblVpdmZzS2UwSGoyaTlmOXpRTE8yeGlKdHczQlFEaEh0MXNJVUY4QWtfa3dDQkk0RTZCR0d4LXVDTjQ2dUhlZEdXcUh0b29fcWtjRmNWV1Mzd0h3QnhUR3Q1X3VudU9ReEpQZFVhMFVhc05SYXRFWm1TNGpKZ0RR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt; (ocrelizumab) as a first-line treatment for early-stage relapsing forms of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) is significantly better at delaying disease progression than starting with a less effective drug and switching to Ocrevus later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to nine years of data from the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01247324"&gt;OPERA I (NCT01247324)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01412333"&gt;OPERA II (NCT01412333)&lt;/a&gt; Phase 3 trials, where participants were first assigned to Ocrevus or &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/rebif/"&gt;Rebif&lt;/a&gt; (interferon beta-1a) for two years, and then they all received Ocrevus in the trials’ open-label extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis focused on patients who’d never received any &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt; (DMT) before enrolling in the OPERA studies. After nine years, nearly half of those always on Ocrevus achieved no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3), meaning they were free of relapses, MRI activity, and confirmed disability worsening, nearly twice the rate observed in patients who first started on Rebif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These data support the use of the high-efficacy therapy [Ocrevus] as a first-line therapy in patients diagnosed with early-stage [relapsing MS], for improved long-term clinical outcomes with a favorable safety profile, similar to what was observed in the overall [Ocrevus]-treated population,” the researchers wrote. The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210142"&gt;Long-Term Treatment With Ocrelizumab in Patients With Early-Stage Relapsing MS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocrevus is an antibody-based therapy that targets the CD20 protein at the surface of B-cells, immune cells that contribute to MS-driving inflammation. By promoting the cells’ death, the therapy should ease inflammation and reduce MS activity and progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy was approved for relapsing &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;forms of MS&lt;/a&gt; based on data from the OPERA trials, which showed it was superior to Rebif at reducing relapse rates and MRI lesions, and at slowing disability progression. These differences continued for more than a decade in the open-label extensions, even after the Rebif group had switched to Ocrevus, for up to nine years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While accumulating evidence suggests that starting a high-efficacy DMT such as Ocrevus as early as possible is better at reducing the risk of disability accumulation in the long term, there’s limited data about whether that also applies to people who are relatively early in their disease course and haven’t yet received a DMT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of first-line Ocrevus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/"&gt;Roche&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Ocrevus’ developer &lt;a href="https://www.gene.com/"&gt;Genentech&lt;/a&gt;, and their colleagues examined data from a subgroup from the OPERA trials who were treatment-naive and had been diagnosed up to two years before enrolling in the studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included 757 patients across both trials, 382 of whom were initially assigned to Ocrevus and 375 to Rebif. About two-thirds of them (67%) entered the open-label extensions and received Ocrevus until their nine-year follow-up assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observed in the main OPERA analyses, treatment-naive patients with early relapsing MS also benefited more from Ocrevus in the main trials than from Rebif. Ocrevus-treated patients were about 3.5 times more likely to achieve NEDA after two years (72.5% vs. 43.8%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were also consistently less likely to have any of the individual components of NEDA, including relapses, active inflammatory lesions and new or enlarging lesions, and 24-week confirmed disability progression, which is defined as an increase in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-prognosis-life-expectancy/#MS_Progression"&gt;Expanded Disability Status Scale&lt;/a&gt; (EDSS) scores sustained for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of starting Ocrevus as the first-line therapy were sustained throughout the open-label periods, the researchers found. For example, 48.2% of the patients who started Ocrevus maintained their NEDA-3 status for the whole nine years compared with 25.7% of those who switched to Ocrevus in the extensions. This meant that people who started Ocrevus early had a 2.7 greater likelihood of maintaining NEDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comparing disability progression, relapse rates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the rates of disability progression became similar between the two groups after Rebif patients switched to Ocrevus, the benefits in the first two years were sustained through nine years, meaning the Rebif group had greater disability levels after nine years because their disease had progressed faster on Rebif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relapse rates were also significantly lower among Ocrevus patients for the whole nine years (0.05 vs. 0.09) because those on Rebif had seen a higher rate of relapses in the main trials. Similar observations were made for brain volume loss, a measure of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is important to note that the higher disability accrual and average brain volume loss observed during the [two] years on [Rebif] treatment were not recovered, even after switching to [Ocrevus], indicating that initiating treatment with [Ocrevus] earlier in the disease course is beneficial to patients,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall safety profile was similar between both groups, with no new safety signals observed during the open-label extension phase. The most reported side effects were infections, but rates of them remained low and stable over nine years of continuous Ocrevus treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results “further reinforce the use of an initial high-efficacy therapy, which can provide beneficial short-term and long-term effects on disease progression as compared with an escalation approach for patients with MS,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:46:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPY2Y1OXZmNDFobnliOWlGYjl3aDFLcW1XbHNQTU9sN1E3bnRWNmhGT2ZTZ3BXX3ZxVVd2cW5vUktKRU5NV3YybUdZblcxblVpdmZzS2UwSGoyaTlmOXpRTE8yeGlKdHczQlFEaEh0MXNJVUY4QWtfa3dDQkk0RTZCR0d4LXVDTjQ2dUhlZEdXcUh0b29fcWtjRmNWV1Mzd0h3QnhUR3Q1X3VudU9ReEpQZFVhMFVhc05SYXRFWm1TNGpKZ0RR</guid></item><item><title>People living to 100 all have the same drink 'multiple times a day' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbUpQVVpwMTFtR3dSdEVJZUN6NjhFcmNPMm13eUNFT25ocUNQcVhTamJXOWs0Y05mYUZMUUltbjBYenVfa2JIQ1dIWWdLRTRYWi1nZ0FOd1RsQUxLMWwwZ2V1elVBMVl4N180aHpSX21TSjFqRk0tNFB4NTRmaVE0NTl3Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have found that individuals who live to be 100 years old often consume a popular hot beverage "multiple times a day".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers studying blue zones, regions where a significant number of people live beyond 100, are trying to uncover the secrets to longevity.

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctor says the drink contains polyphenols, a known antioxidant. Polyphenols also reportedly have anti-inflammatory effects and potential cardiovascular health benefits, and their presence is often associated with a reduced risk of various chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8705407/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20our%20findings%20suggest%20that,release%20compounds%20with%20higher%20bioactivity." rel="nofollow"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; revealed the health benefits of coffee, as it noted: "Coffee contains human health-related molecules, namely polyphenols that possess a wide range of pharmacological functions, and their intake is associated with reduced colon cancer risk." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research went further, finding after testing responses to numerous cups of coffee to human enzymes: "Coffee was demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In fact, coffee samples inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory pathways, thus exerting potential protective effects against cancer transformation on human colon cells."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Coffee an antioxidant&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)27781-3/fulltext" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, coffee ranks at sixth in a list of 50 foods rich in antioxidants. Only blackberries, walnuts, strawberries, artichokes, and blueberries ranked more highly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The journal stated: "Of the 50 food products highest in antioxidant concentrations, 13 were spices, eight were in the fruit and vegetables category, five were berries, five were chocolate-based, five were breakfast cereals, and four were nuts or seeds."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;"On the basis of typical serving sizes, blackberries, walnuts, strawberries, artichokes, cranberries, brewed coffee, raspberries, pecans, blueberries, ground cloves, grape juice, and unsweetened baking chocolate were at the top of the ranked list."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Filipiak has suggested that the impact of coffee on heart health can vary based on consumption levels. Occasional coffee drinkers may experience a brief rise in blood pressure, whereas habitual consumers might adjust to such effects, eventually managing them better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can coffee lower the risk of developing diabetes?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; Coffee is also said to improve insulin sensitivity, reducing the risks of developing type two diabetes. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8066601/#sec8-nutrients-13-01144" rel="nofollow"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; says this is because it helps "liver fat oxidation". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It said: "One major site of coffee actions appears to be the liver, causing improved fat oxidation and lower risk of steatosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Another major effect of coffee intake is preservation of functional beta cell mass via enhanced mitochondrial function, lower endoplasmic reticulum stress and prevention or clearance of aggregates of misfolded proinsulin or amylin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Long-term preservation of proper liver and beta cell function may account for the association of habitual coffee drinking with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, rather than acute improvement of metabolic control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbUpQVVpwMTFtR3dSdEVJZUN6NjhFcmNPMm13eUNFT25ocUNQcVhTamJXOWs0Y05mYUZMUUltbjBYenVfa2JIQ1dIWWdLRTRYWi1nZ0FOd1RsQUxLMWwwZ2V1elVBMVl4N180aHpSX21TSjFqRk0tNFB4NTRmaVE0NTl3Zw</guid></item><item><title>Counties issue declaration of emergency support amid ongoing bird flu outbreak - WHIO</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 fQmwWk article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;MIAMI VALLEY — As the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak continues to affect Ohio farmers, two local counties have made a declaration of emergency story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[DOWNLOAD: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whio.com/mobile-apps/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free WHIO-TV News app for alerts as news breaks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;On Tuesday, Feb. 18, The Board of Commissioners in both Mercer and Darke County passed an emergency declaration of government support due to the ongoing bird flu outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRENDING STORIES:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Darke County experienced its first case of HPAI on Dec. 24, 2024, while Mercer County had its first case on Jan. 10, 2025, according to the resolution documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Both counties stated that the HPAI poses “a severe risk to the economic stability of the agricultural sector,” of their respective communities, creating a “ripple of effects” and impacting employment, supply chain demands, price inflation, and stability of small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Both counties also stated that the affected poultry farms are “vital to the local economy and provide essential food products to the region, state, and nation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;According to the declarations, both counties are requesting the following support from the State and Federal Governments to assist “assist in the containment, eradication, and recovery efforts related to the disease’: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability to perform more testing on bars that have tested positive but aren’t showing any symptoms;

While they may not be as outgoing as dogs, they still have plenty of personality. As such, feline quirks are some pretty entertaining things to witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just take this &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/cats/ragdoll-cats-and-kittens-a-photo-gallery-and-information" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ragdoll cat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ragdoll cat&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Every time her human mama puts fresh water in her water bowl, instead of neatly lapping it up, she proceeds to stick her entire face in the bowl. Unsurprisingly, this is pretty darn hilarious!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s almost like she prefers to lick the drips of water coming off of her fur instead of just lapping the water out of her bowl like a normal cat. What’s more, her feline sibling has a pretty funny reaction to it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Notice how her &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cat-warming-kitty-sibling-definition-143000116.html" data-ylk="slk:kitty sibling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;kitty sibling&lt;/a&gt; averts their eyes when she begins lapping the water off of her dripping fur. They then look towards the camera, and presumably their human mom, as if to say, “I don’t know why she does this either.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We would be remiss if we didn’t also point out the look that this ragdoll kitty gives the camera at the start of the video. It’s almost as if she is saying, “I know what you’re doing. Don’t judge me. I’m just trying to live my best life. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go drink water from my dripping fur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hey, we’re not judging. We were simply pointing out that this is a very interesting and hilarious quirk for a cat to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/funny-cat-joins-little-girls-180000994.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Funny Cat Joins Little Girls' Tea Party &amp;amp; He's 'Clearly in Heaven';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Funny Cat Joins Little Girls' Tea Party &amp;amp; He's 'Clearly in Heaven'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Internet had some opinions to share about this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some feline parents, such as TikTok user J, totally related to this video because they have seen their fur baby do something similar at home when they wrote, “My cat will dip her front paws in her freshly refilled fountain and splash the water around, and if she knocks it over in the middle of the night she cries until I fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other people in the comments section, like TikTok user [mod] jackie, were completely taken aback by the attitude this ragdoll cat displayed with her side eye before she dunked her head in the bowl when they wrote, “The face she makes beforehand is taking me out LOL!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, there were other people in the comments section who had a different take on the matter. TikTok user ‼PUBLIC ENEMY #1!! was of the opinion that this ragdoll cat dunked her head in the bowl because felines often struggle with depth perception. They wrote, “I've heard some cats have trouble with depth perception when their water is in clear bowls! Might be the cause, or maybe she's just silly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Do Cats Struggle With Depth Perception?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Did you know that cats only have &lt;a href="https://vetexplainspets.com/what-does-cat-vision-look-like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two types of color receptors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;two types of color receptors&lt;/a&gt;? They can see blue and green. Whereas humans can see red, green, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because of this, our feline companions view the world in a more limited and muted range of colors compared to us. They are much more adept at perceiving things in low light conditions thanks to having a high number of rod cells in their eyes. However, this also reduces their depth perception and makes it harder for them to notice fine details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more PetHelpful updates?

However, some individuals have reported chronic symptoms that developed soon after receiving a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 vaccine. This little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;), remains unrecognized by medical authorities, and little is known about its biological underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Yale researchers have taken initial steps to characterize this condition, uncovering potential immunological patterns that differentiate those with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; from others. The findings are early and require further confirmation but may eventually guide strategies to help affected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/akiko-iwasaki/"&gt;Akiko Iwasaki&lt;/a&gt;, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YSM&lt;/span&gt;) and co-senior author of the study &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1"&gt;published Feb. 19 as a preprint on MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common chronic symptoms of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; include &lt;a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/12/19/study-helps-explain-post-covid-exercise-intolerance"&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, excessive fatigue, brain fog, insomnia, and dizziness. They develop shortly after vaccination, within a day or two, can become more severe in the days that follow, and persist over time. More studies are needed to understand the prevalence of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/harlan-krumholz/"&gt;Harlan Krumholz&lt;/a&gt;, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YSM&lt;/span&gt; and co-senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for the study came from Yale’s &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/listen-study/"&gt;Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISTEN&lt;/span&gt;) Study&lt;/a&gt;, through which researchers aim to better understand long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;. For the new study, researchers included data from 42 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISTEN&lt;/span&gt; participants who reported symptoms of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; and 22 individuals who did not report any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; symptoms after receiving a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From participants’ blood samples, the researchers looked for immune features that were different between the two groups. They found several differences in immune cell populations; those with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; had lower levels of effector &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD4&lt;/span&gt;+ T cells and higher levels of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNF&lt;/span&gt;-alpha+ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD8&lt;/span&gt; T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also differences in the levels of antibodies that the body uses to target &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-CoV-2. Participants with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; who had never contracted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-CoV-2 spike protein than control participants, likely because they tended to have fewer vaccine doses than individuals without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;. Fewer vaccine doses and no viral infection means the body’s immune system has had little opportunity to develop a defense to the virus, said the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers measured levels of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-CoV-2 spike protein — the part of the virus that enables it to penetrate and infect host cells and what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 vaccines use to trigger immune responses against the virus — they found that some individuals with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;, even those without evidence for infection, had higher levels of spike protein than controls. Typically spike protein can be detected for a few days after vaccination, but some participants with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; had detectable levels more than 700 days after their last vaccination. Persistent spike protein has been associated with long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising, to find spike protein in circulation at such a late time point,” said Iwasaki. “We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; who didn’t have any measurable spike protein. But it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz explained that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; might be similar to how different infections can cause chronic symptoms through distinct biological pathways. “One person might develop chronic symptoms due to immune dysregulation, while another experiences lingering effects from viral reactivation,” he said. “We need to map these different pathways carefully to understand what is happening in each case. This work is just beginning, and further studies are essential to guide diagnosis and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the researchers want to further validate these findings in a larger group of people “This is far from a final answer on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;,” said Iwasaki. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also investigating several possible drivers of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;. Along with spike protein persistence, the researchers are assessing the contributions of autoimmunity, tissue damage, and Epstein-Barr Virus (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBV&lt;/span&gt;) reactivation. In the study, individuals with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; were more likely than those without the syndrome to have evidence of reactivated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBV&lt;/span&gt;, which is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, also known as “mono.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deeper understanding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; and its drivers could lead to better vaccines that have fewer side effects, effective methods for diagnosing the syndrome, and targets for treatment, said the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, if we can determine why spike protein is persisting for as long as it is in some people, maybe we can remove it — with monoclonal antibodies, for example — and maybe that could help reduce &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt; symptoms,” said Iwasaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iwasaki is also a professor of dermatology and of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health, and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only just starting to make headway in understanding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVS&lt;/span&gt;,” said Krumholz. “Every medical intervention carries some risk, and it’s important to acknowledge that adverse events can occur with vaccines. Our focus must remain on understanding what these people are experiencing through rigorous science and addressing the needs of those affected with compassion and an open mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Experts say the work highlights the importance of the “exposome” – the host of environmental exposures we encounter in life, from our living conditions to whether we smoke – for health, including how we age and why we develop age-related chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Austin Argentieri, the first author of the research at Harvard and the Broad Institute, said: “For a lot of these diseases, it’s really the environment and exposome that’s driving a lot of our risk for these outcomes, and investments in understanding and modifying our environments are likely going to have a profound impact on improving health for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Argentieri and colleagues at Oxford Population &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and other institutions report how they analysed whether 164 environmental exposures, from salt intake to living with a partner, were associated with the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7a74e936-2c07-4e17-8a10-c7e6bd243988"

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;After excluding, for example, exposures related to existing diseases, or that might simply reflect another underlying factor, the team were left with 85 environment exposures associated with the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They then carried out a further analysis, based on proteins in the blood, to identify which of these exposures were also associated with how rapidly people were ageing biologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The resulting 25 environmental exposures included childhood factors such as maternal smoking around birth and whether participants were relatively short at age 10, as well as more recent factors such as whether participants were employed and their household income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Alcohol intake and other aspects of diet were not among the exposures, possibly, the researchers say, because of difficulties in investigating these factors through questionnaires and inconsistencies in their associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team report that many of the 25 exposures showed associations with particular age-related diseases and biomarkers of ageing, which, Argentieri said, sheds light on the various ways they could influence early mortality. Crucially, the team stress, 23 of these exposures can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a further analysis, the team found age and sex together explained about half of the variation in risk of premature death, while the 25 environmental exposures together explained an additional 17% of the variation. By contrast, genetic predisposition for 22 major diseases explained less than 2% of additional variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The environmental exposures were also more important than genes in explaining why some people have a higher risk of developing diseases of the lungs, heart and liver in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

                    &lt;p&gt;Lupus can do irreversible harm to a person’s organs, damaging the lungs, kidneys, heart, liver and other vital organs through inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a newer lupus drug appears to protect patients from much of this organ damage, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/anifrolumab.html"&gt;Anifrolumab&lt;/a&gt; (brand name Saphnelo) reduced the risk of long-term organ damage progression by about 60% in patients with moderately to severely active lupus, researchers reported in a new study published this month in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003496725000810?via%3Dihub"&gt;Annals of the Rheumatic Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003496725000810?via%3Dihub"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anifrolumab plus standard of care (SOC) is effective at reducing organ damage accumulation and prolonging time to organ damage progression compared to SOC alone over 4 years,” a team led by &lt;a href="https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/faculty/zahi-touma"&gt;Dr. Zahi Touma&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with lupus are typically treated using a combination of inflammation-quelling meds like steroids, antimalarials, immunosuppressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, researchers said in background notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these drugs don't stop organ damage from lupus, and in some cases might even contribute to it, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They decided to see if a newer drug, anifrolumab, might better help prevent organ damage if added to the existing brew used to treat lupus patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anifrolumab in 2021 for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, the most common form of lupus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anifolumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking the receptors for type 1 interferon, a biochemical that plays a key role in promoting inflammation, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s given once a month via an IV drip, according to Drugs.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the trial, researchers compared 354 patients prescribed anifrolumab against 561 patients who received the usual care for lupus. All of these patients participated in the clinical trials that led to anifrolumab’s approval in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results showed that people taking anifrolumab scored about 0.43 points lower on an index tracking organ damage caused by lupus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1-point increase in that index has previously been associated with a 34% increase in a lupus patient’s risk of premature death, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anifrolumab patients also had a 61% lower risk of having their organ damage get worse, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was paid for by AstraZeneca, which manufactures Saphnelo.&lt;/p&gt;

But in a small number of people, the shots may have led to a constellation of side effects that includes fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus and dizziness, together referred to as “post-vaccination syndrome,” according to a small new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some people with this syndrome &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;appear to show distinct biological changes&lt;/a&gt;, the research found — among them differences in immune cells, reawakening of a dormant virus called Epstein-Barr, and the persistence of a coronavirus protein in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study was posted online Wednesday and has not yet been published in a scientific journal. “I want to emphasize that this is still a work in progress,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who led the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s not like this study determined what’s making people sick,” she said, “but it’s the first kind of glimpse at what may be going on within these people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Independent experts noted that the findings were not conclusive on their own.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers from Oxford Population Health has shown that a range of environmental factors, including lifestyle (smoking and physical activity), and living conditions, have a greater impact on health and premature death than our genes.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from nearly half a million UK Biobank participants to assess the influence of 164 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+risk+scores/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic risk scores&lt;/a&gt; for 22 major diseases on aging, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/age-related+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;age-related diseases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/premature+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;. The study was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors explained 17% of the variation in risk of death, compared to less than 2% explained by genetic predisposition (as we understand it at present);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the 25 independent environmental factors identified, smoking, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/socioeconomic+status/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;, physical activity, and living conditions had the most impact on mortality and biological aging;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoking was associated with 21 diseases; socioeconomic factors such as household income, home ownership, and employment status, were associated with 19 diseases; and physical activity was associated with 17 diseases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 of the factors identified are modifiable;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early life exposures, including body weight at 10 years and maternal smoking around birth, were shown to influence aging and risk of premature death 30–80 years later;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental exposures had a greater effect on diseases of the lung, heart and liver, while genetic risk dominated for dementias and breast cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Professor Cornelia van Duijn, St Cross Professor of Epidemiology at Oxford Population Heath and senior author of the paper, said "Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate aging early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors used a unique measure of aging (a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-08-proteins-blood-insights-aging-age.html"&gt;new "aging clock"&lt;/a&gt;) to monitor how rapidly people are aging using blood protein levels. This enabled them to link &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+exposures/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt; that predict early mortality with biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This measure was previously shown to detect age-related changes, not only in the UK Biobank, but also in two other large cohort studies from China and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Austin Argentieri, lead author of the study at Oxford Population Health and Research Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said "Our exposome approach allowed us to quantify the relative contributions of the environment and genetics to aging, providing the most comprehensive overview to date of the environmental and lifestyle factors driving aging and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the potential benefits of focusing interventions on our environments, socioeconomic contexts, and behaviors for the prevention of many age-related diseases and premature death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bryan Williams, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at the British Heart Foundation, added, "Your income, postcode and background shouldn't determine your chances of living a long and healthy life. But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have long known that risk factors such as smoking impact our heart and circulatory health, but this new research emphasizes just how great the opportunity is to influence our chances of developing health problems, including cardiovascular disease, and dying prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need bold action from Government to target the surmountable barriers to good health that too many people in the UK are facing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research shows that while many of the individual exposures identified played a small part in premature death, the combined effect of these multiple exposures together over the life course (referred to as the exposome) explained a large proportion of premature mortality variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights from this study pave the way for integrated strategies to improve the health of aging populations by identifying key combinations of environmental factors that shape the risk of premature death and many common age-related diseases simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Professor van Duijn said "Studies on environmental health have tended to focus on individual exposures based on a specific hypothesis. While this approach has seen many successes, the method has not always yielded reproducible and reliable findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Instead, we have followed a 'hypothesis free' exposome approach and studied all available exposures to find the major drivers of disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have made a big leap forward in understanding how to provide accurate evidence on the causes and consequences of age-related diseases by combining novel computational methods with clinical and epidemiological knowledge to explore the interplay between multiple exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In an ever-changing environment, it is critical that we combine these techniques with novel advances in smart technology to monitor lifestyle and environment, as well as with biological data, to understand the impact of the environment over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are a lot of questions still to be answered related to diet, lifestyle, and exposure to new pathogens (such as bird flu and COVID-19) and chemicals (think of pesticides and plastics), and the impact of environmental and genetic factors in different populations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was led by researchers from Oxford Population Health in collaboration with researchers from the Departments of Psychiatry and Anthropology at the University of Oxford; Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute, Boston; the University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University, Rotterdam; and the University of Montpellier.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that dream recall is influenced by personality traits, sleep patterns, and even seasonal changes. People who frequently daydream and have a positive attitude toward dreams were more likely to remember them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lighter sleep stages also increased the likelihood of waking up with dream memories, with younger individuals recalling dreams more often than older ones. The findings suggest that dream recall is shaped by cognitive and physiological factors rather than being random. Understanding these mechanisms could offer insights into mental health and the role of dreaming in consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind-Wandering and Attitude Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; People who daydream and value dreams recall them more often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Stage Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Longer periods of light sleep increase dream recall likelihood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age and Seasons Affect Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; Younger individuals remember dreams more, and recall is lower in winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IMT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people wake up vividly recalling their dreams from the night, and can tell precise stories experienced during the night, while others struggle to remember even a single detail. Why does this happen? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, conducted by researchers at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, and published on &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt; explores the factors that influence so called “dream recall”— the ability to remember dreams upon awakening—and uncovers which individual traits and sleep patterns shape this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why there is such a difference in recalling dreams remains a mystery. Some studies found that women, young persons, or people with a tendency to daydreaming tend to better recall night dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107878"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person floating in a dream." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/dream-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dream recall, defined as the probability of waking up in the morning with impressions and memories from a dream experience, showed considerable variability between individuals and was influenced by multiple factors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other studies did not confirm these findings. And other hypotheses, such as that personality traits or cognitive abilities count, received even less support from data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the recent COVID pandemic, the phenomenon of the individual differences in morning dream recall attracted renewed public and scientific attention when an abrupt surge in morning dream recall was reported worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, carried out in collaboration with the University of Camerino, was conducted in the years from 2020 to 2024, and involved over 200 participants, aged 18 to 70, who recorded their dreams daily for 15 days while their sleep and cognitive data were tracked using wearable devices and psychometric tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each study participant was given a voice recorder to report, every day right after the awakening, about the experiences they had during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had to report whether they remembered having dreamed or not, if they had the impression of having dreamed but did not remember anything about the experience, and to describe the content of the dream if they were able to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the duration of the study, participants also wore an actigraph, a sleep monitoring wristwatch that detects sleep duration, efficiency, and disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning and end of the dream recording period, participants were subjected to psychological tests and questionnaires that measure various factors, from anxiety levels to interest in dreams, proneness to mind-wandering (the tendency to frequently shift attention away from the task at hand toward unrelated thoughts, or internal reflections), up to memory and selective attention tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dream recall, defined as the probability of waking up in the morning with impressions and memories from a dream experience, showed considerable variability between individuals and was influenced by multiple factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that people with a positive attitude toward dreams and a tendency for mind-wandering were significantly more likely to recall their dreams. Sleep patterns also seemed to play a critical role: individuals who experienced longer periods of light sleep had a greater likelihood of waking with a memory of their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger participants showed higher rates of dream recall, while older individuals often experienced “white dreams” (a sensation of having dreamt without recalling any details). This suggests age-related changes in memory processes during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, seasonal variations emerged, with participants reporting lower dream recall during winter compared to spring, hinting at the potential influence of environmental or circadian factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits, and sleep dynamics interact,” explains lead author Giulio Bernardi, professor in general psychology at the IMT School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These insights not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind dreaming but also have implications for exploring dreams’ role in mental health and in the study of human consciousness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Data collected within this project will serve as a reference for future comparisons with clinical populations,” adds Valentina Elce, researcher at the IMT School and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This will allow us to move forward the research on the pathological alterations of dreaming and their potential prognostic and diagnostic value”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dreaming and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#690a0100081b0847190805040c1b0007002900041d051c0a0a0847001d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chiara Palmerini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://imtlucca.it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IMT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chiara Palmerini – IMT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44271-025-00191-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/a&gt;” by Giulio Bernardi et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that (almost) everyone dreams during their sleep and may actually do so for a large part of the night. Yet, dream recall shows large interindividual variability. Understanding the factors that influence dream recall is crucial for advancing our knowledge regarding dreams’ origin, significance, and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we tackled this issue by prospectively collecting dream reports along with demographic information and psychometric, cognitive, actigraphic, and electroencephalographic measures in 217 healthy adults (18–70 y, 116 female participants, 101 male participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that attitude towards dreaming, proneness to mind wandering, and sleep patterns are associated with the probability of reporting a dream upon morning awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of recalling dream content was predicted by age and vulnerability to interference. Moreover, dream recall appeared to be influenced by night-by-night changes in sleep patterns and showed seasonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results provide an account for previous observations regarding inter- and intra-individual variability in morning dream recall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:26:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1oUXZBa0dtREtTbGlKcXVqTEZRRTN5TW9NWVRSal9JRTVzTUpqS1RfeEJSemxKMWFXOFNZRTE0dWtSWGlpWE1Zd2FtMFFwaDE1Wmt6R3V1emhjT0JrS3ExZng4NDdoSDNNX2NrSlBB</guid></item><item><title>Reduce cholesterol and improve heart health with 'spectacular' oil - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWDBvZG1wNU5pWDlLaFpNOS1KQWNDSVpWdHYwSkNOSXd4VllNbXdOUEZlTkRGMmtMQzNvMUJEMjRXanc3T1gzZTRwUUU2ZmJzdEFpYnNRLWZGSDJGTGlkUnluWXppbVE5anVQM0pweTRyS1h0SnppdWlacGsxZ1NSYWZCcDg2bEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition where plaque builds up within the coronary arteries, restricting blood flow to the heart and preventing the heart muscle from receiving sufficient oxygen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition can be chronic, with the coronary artery narrowing over time and reducing the blood supply to the heart muscle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leading a healthy lifestyle that includes good nutrition can play a significant role in avoiding coronary artery disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A heart-healthy diet can help maintain low blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels, possibly preventing a heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2014/november/headline_376522_en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by Dr Bill Mullen of Glasgow University, fatty oil could be the solution to combat cardiovascular diseases, some cancers, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that, amongst the cooking oils sampled (including sunflower oil and rapeseed oil), only olive oil had a positive impact on heart health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dr Mullen's study measured minuscule protein fragments in urine levels which, when combined, are indicators – or "biomarkers" – of heart health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volunteers participated in the study over six weeks and "did not know what oil they were consuming, and analysts processing the samples and the data did not know which oil was being used either", reports &lt;a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/health/lower-heart-disease-risk-oil-9957751" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;Bristol Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mullen remarked: "The results of the study were spectacular. Both extra virgin olive oil and olive oil produced significant changes after only six weeks, a change of 0.3 in the coronary artery disease biomarker score. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Links between diet and good health are notoriously difficult to prove. This latest breakthrough in biomarker technology is finally changing that."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further explained that the research proved that "only olive oil has a positive impact on heart health".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mullen emphasised the importance of consuming 20ml (four teaspoons) of olive oil daily in its raw form for its beneficial effects on coronary artery disease (CAD), regardless of whether it's extra virgin olive oil or "refined". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Highlighting olive oil's historical significance, Professor Francesco Visioli said olive oil has been a staple of the Mediterranean diet for more than 70 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31037419" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Visioli also noted that people who adhered to the Mediterranean diet had lower overall cholesterol levels and higher levels of "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Co-author of a more recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36343558/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Miguel A Martinez Gonzalez, from the University of Navarra in Spain, highlighted the "impressive results" he found when participants replaced fats with olive oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Miguel said: "Extra virgin olive oil in particular prompted a 40 per cent reduction in type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The British Heart Foundation (BHF) acknowledged that some research on olive oil's health benefits aligns with current heart and circulatory health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, the charity questioned the evidence supporting the superiority of olive oil over other oils like sunflower, rapeseed, or traditional fats such as butter, lard, or ghee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it is now widely accepted that olive oil contains compounds associated with health advantages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The BHF advised: "Instead of taking olive oil as a supplement think about adding it to meals, for example as a salad dressing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWDBvZG1wNU5pWDlLaFpNOS1KQWNDSVpWdHYwSkNOSXd4VllNbXdOUEZlTkRGMmtMQzNvMUJEMjRXanc3T1gzZTRwUUU2ZmJzdEFpYnNRLWZGSDJGTGlkUnluWXppbVE5anVQM0pweTRyS1h0SnppdWlacGsxZ1NSYWZCcDg2bEk</guid></item><item><title>Unhealthy Diet Increases Risk for Incontinence - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOE1QTURzRG0zc2o5WktYazhDdWdsRnNxNFBfbWpqS1dTVzh3RnZQNVpBWm5Dbm9TSnBLREg5cW03Yl9ramh2MWx3RlBaVlRnYWNmb2pkRFdvV04yMFdBYXNqZzFBaGE3VzI3TlhwWnNnMTdXbkFJaGVJUVRqdmJMalFvcFFJeHZDN1BFekVGbW5OV1AwQ0t6QtIBngFBVV95cUxQcFptMU9zS2FYXy1QMkJXczdVYTZaWGpHb2VaVmpNbEdVblhOc2V3Y29ibElOVDZCVGJiMTk3d1h6MkZxdmlzckc5M19xMWZxSlNDck14aGlqRjdhTHJFUDhYVGNkVmdsV015WlgtZl9SNFFEX3hqNkFWQmE0cFgteDNsdUlHSDNkUHBwdmhDWWJBRFpXSVlfLUo4Rkd1QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A junk-food lifestyle might contribute to embarrassing little leaks in middle-aged women, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women who often munch fast food or packaged eats appear more likely to develop urinary incontinence, researchers recently reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/17455057241305075"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently eating either processed or fast food is associated with a 50% increased risk of a leaky bladder, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Higher consumption of highly processed ready-made foods and fast food increased the risk for experiencing the symptoms of stress and urgency urinary incontinence,” lead investigator &lt;a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en/people/mari-kuutti"&gt;Mari Kuutti&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral researcher at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, “higher consumption of fruits and overall higher quality diet decreased the risk for stress urinary incontinence,” Kuutti added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many as 45% of women worldwide are affected by urinary incontinence, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women become more likely to develop incontinence as aging affects the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to control urination, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they suspected that a poor diet might also influence the pelvic floor, as key nutrients like protein, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are important for proper muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their study, researchers tracked the health of nearly 1,100 Finnish women 47 to 55 years old. More than half already had symptoms of pelvic floor problems like urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women filled out a questionnaire that included questions related to their eating choices and behaviors, as well as any problems with incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results showed that fast food and processed food significantly increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/which-surgery-for-stress-urinary-incontinence-is-best-for-you"&gt;stress incontinence&lt;/a&gt;, in which urine leaks out when a person coughs, laughs or does something to increase pressure on their bladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly processed foods also were associated with a 40% increased risk of urgency incontinence, in which a person feels a sudden, strong urge to urinate even if their bladder isn’t full, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, eating fruit every day reduced the risk of stress incontinence by 20%, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These associations held even after researchers accounted for other risk factors like the women’s body mass index (BMI), an estimate of body fat based on height and weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processed and fast foods might increase the risk of oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are associated with urinary incontinence, researchers said. Fruits contain high levels of antioxidants that counteract those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a preventive action, eating behavior of women with the risk of these symptoms should be assessed, and guidance toward healthy eating patterns should be provided,” the research team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they suspected that a poor diet might also influence the pelvic floor, as key nutrients like protein, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are important for proper muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their study, researchers tracked the health of nearly 1,100 Finnish women 47 to 55 years old. More than half already had symptoms of pelvic floor problems like urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women filled out a questionnaire that included questions related to their eating choices and behaviors, as well as any problems with incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results showed that fast food and processed food significantly increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/which-surgery-for-stress-urinary-incontinence-is-best-for-you"&gt;stress incontinence&lt;/a&gt;, in which urine leaks out when a person coughs, laughs or does something to increase pressure on their bladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly processed foods also were associated with a 40% increased risk of urgency incontinence, in which a person feels a sudden, strong urge to urinate even if their bladder isn’t full, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, eating fruit every day reduced the risk of stress incontinence by 20%, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These associations held even after researchers accounted for other risk factors like the women’s body mass index (BMI), an estimate of body fat based on height and weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processed and fast foods might increase the risk of oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are associated with urinary incontinence, researchers said. Fruits contain high levels of antioxidants that counteract those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a preventive action, eating behavior of women with the risk of these symptoms should be assessed, and guidance toward healthy eating patterns should be provided,” the research team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists estimate that tens of trillions of viruses live inside of us, though they’ve identified just a fraction of them. A vast majority are benign, and some may even be beneficial. We don’t know for sure, because most of the so-called human virome remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This year, five universities are teaming up for an unprecedented hunt to identify these viruses. They will gather saliva, stool, blood, milk and other samples from thousands of volunteers. The five-year effort, called the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/humanvirome" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Human Virome Program&lt;/a&gt; and supported by $171 million in federal funding, will inspect the samples with artificial intelligence systems, hoping to learn about how the human virome influences our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I think it will swamp the data that we’ve had up until now,” said Frederic Bushman, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the program’s leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5221746/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;first hints&lt;/a&gt; of the human virome emerged over a century ago. Analyzing stool samples, scientists discovered viruses known as phages that could infect bacteria inside the gut.

ROACH: I’m 80 and in very good physical shape. I walk 10-20 miles or more on hiking trails weekly, even though I have a pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SI37BM4D35BFTMIKNXJCRM2D2I"&gt;I fell down our stairs hauling boxes and hurt my knee. I developed a Baker’s cyst on the back of it that is the size of a tennis ball. I have gone to an orthopedic doctor and had an ultrasound and x-rays done, but nothing showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6HCP2E7RF5CI5OCGWBHEKABL5I"&gt;As I understand it, a Baker’s cyst comes about because of excess fluid in the knee, but they can’t find the cause of the excess fluid. Is it a torn meniscus, arthritis, or a torn ligament like an ACL? Can I have an MRI done on my knee if I have a pacemaker?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KQSITJ2TBRAHTM4ZGL7VBMYJRY"&gt;Would it be smart to get a second opinion to find the cause and recommended treatment, like surgery? I can only walk to the mailbox, and I’m in a lot of pain. -- J.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F4TNNSDGDVG33OP6DMNYENTSJ4"&gt;ANSWER: A Baker’s cyst is a fluid-filled sac behind the knee. In older adults, they are nearly always a result of knee damage. Almost every patient I’ve had with a Baker’s cyst has had osteoarthritis of the knee, but they can occur as a result of an injury, such as the fall you had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HBFZN3KBQNF7JC4SGA7T7OADLI"&gt;Many people with Baker’s cysts have no symptoms, but if they are painful like yours, orthopedic surgeons will usually try an injection. However, given your injury, I am a bit surprised they didn’t order an MRI, which can usually be done in people with newer pacemakers. (Talk to your cardiologist about this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TIIVURU4EFCURGUUR7CQU2BLZQ"&gt;If your cardiologist gives the OK, it’s fine to go back to your first orthopedic surgeon and ask them about it. In severe cases, surgery can be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

This direct feedback loop between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus allows the brain to prioritize important sights and sounds almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the slower, previously known pathway, this circuit may help distinguish relevant stimuli from background noise, with implications for conditions like PTSD and autism.

The indirect route can cause time lags that change the HC feedback signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using modern methods, the current research team found a second loop that directly connects the HC to EC layers 2 and 3, letting memories and emotions stored in the HC quickly add weight to perceived sights and sounds as part of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paradox in the field has been that there is no known direct pathway connecting the hippocampal memory center with the brain’s emotional center, the amygdala. The newfound connections to the EC may serve as a crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other results of the study map connections between brain cells based on their ability to pump charged particles through channels, building up charge imbalances (potentials) along their membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving the right signal, cells open their channels, enabling the particles to rush out (depolarize) under electrochemical force, with charge flows acting like switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain cells in signaling pathways “fire” as their membrane potential shift, which causes each nerve cell’s extensions (axons) to depolarize until the electric pulse reaches a synapse, a gap between one cell and the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it reaches a gap, the electric pulse is converted into a chemical signal that either turns up (excites) or turns downs (inhibits) the strength of the message passed to the next cell, with their mixture sculpting signals underlying thoughts and memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the current study measured these properties for the first time in both loops. Dr. Basu’s team found the previously known indirect loop to be excitatory, often triggering all-or-nothing signals called action potentials, large depolarizations that encode information based on their frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new direct feedback loop, however, in response to the same range of incoming signal strength, was found to recruit strong inhibition in brain cells (neurons) in EC layers 2 and 3, never eliciting action potentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newfound circuit activity instead sends small depolarizing potentials from the HC to EC layers 2 and 3. The authors say these delicate, repeated signals can combine with messages from other brain regions to make possible more intricate computations, accelerated learning, and greater plasticity, the strengthening of connections between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the research team plans to study how hippocampal output related to emotions and memories shapes decision-making functions in prefrontal cortex or the emotional coding of fear in the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team will also examine what happens to their newfound direct circuit over the course of aging and in Alzheimer’s disease in study mice, and its parallels in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Dr. Basu, study authors from the the NYU Langone Institute for Translational Neuroscience were first author Tanvi Butola as well as Melissa Hernandez Frausto, Lulu Peng, Ariel Hairston, Cara Johnson, Margot Elmaleh, Amanda Amilcar, and Fabliha Hussain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also authors were transgenic tool builder Cliff Kentros and his team members – Stefan Blankvoort and Michael Flatset, of the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology; along with Claudia Clopath, head of the computational neuroscience laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College in London.

Cortico–hippocampal interactions likely mediate this interplay, but underlying circuit mechanisms remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the entorhinal cortex-to-hippocampus pathway, we know little about the organization and function of the hippocampus-to-cortex feedback circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we report in mice, two functionally distinct parallel hippocampus-to-entorhinal cortex feedback pathways: the canonical disynaptic route via layer 5 and a novel monosynaptic input to layer 2/3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit mapping reveals that hippocampal input predominantly drives excitation in layer 5 but feed-forward inhibition in layer 2/3. Upon repetitive pairing with cortical layer 1 inputs, hippocampal inputs undergo homosynaptic potentiation in layer 5, but induce heterosynaptic plasticity and spike output in layer 2/3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, hippocampal inputs to layer 5 and layer 2/3 support object memory encoding versus recall, respectively. Two-photon imaging during navigation reveals hippocampal suppression reduces spatially tuned cortical axonal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present a model, where hippocampal feedback could iteratively shape ongoing cortical processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:56:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSGdsbWRDcHI0a0oteDJtbUE1MHBuRG03ejVrTWc3NDVPQXNtQUJmRF9MYUJvU09xdndocWM3VGxNdkk5OFNRWWZVS3B0c0Q5MEJpTHpvR2FRYXFHRENFZ1VrR3lIV2JDd1lNVE5jM1ZxWERtTnhqX1Q5c1lIMVhDSnRpMEQ</guid></item><item><title>California hospitals full to the brim as US flu cases spike.

Ten of the cases were linked to influenza A, and, of 6 subtyped samples, 3 were 2009 H1N1 and 3 were the H3N2 strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Midwest of America has the highest rates of test positivity. Overall test positivity at clinical labs was 31.6% last week, similar to the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the new report, the CDC recommends everyone ages 6 months and older be vaccinated against seasonal flu while noting that antiviral flu drugs are available for treatment and should be started as early as possible. Antiviral treatment is especially important for those at higher risk for flu complications. While general flu cases are high, emergency department (ED) visits for COVID are low and declining - and test positivity remains stable, according to the CDC.

It can sometimes include fat buildup in the arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can make the skin appear lumpy or have nodules, and can make the skin more sensitive to touch or bruising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a condition that only affects women, and while the NHS doesn’t know exactly how many are affected, Lipoedema UK estimates that up to one in 10 women have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 hUskxA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/31/iStock-2166425342.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/31/iStock-2166425342.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/31/iStock-2166425342.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lipoedema affects the lower body" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-482ou5-1 dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-13844"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Lipoedema affects the lower body&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is quite common, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lipoedema.co.uk/"&gt;Lipoedema UK&lt;/a&gt; says there has been little research into the condition since it was first named in the 1940s, including into its causes and treatments. &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lipoedema.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What little researchers agree on about the condition is that &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258988v1"&gt;it is very likely a genetic condition,&lt;/a&gt; with many women in the same family often affected by it. It is a hormonal condition and it usually begins to develop around puberty, around pregnancy or during menopause.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258988v1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has Love Island star Shaughna Phillips said about having the condition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Phillips shared a photo of herself on &lt;a href="/topic/twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was “such a clear example” of what the condition looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How anyone can accuse sufferers of being lazy/fat is beyond me. It is a medical condition that 1/11 women suffer with, often in silence, often misdiagnosed,” she wrote in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this picture I was struggling with an eating disorder. I was underweight. I was torturing myself in the gym. Yet my legs were getting bigger and bigger. Lipoedema has nothing to do with being overweight. So damaging to continue treating women as if it’s their fault.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root" data-component="Twitter" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of Lipoedema?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three stages of lipoedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first stage, the skin can appear smooth but small lumpy nodules can be felt under the skin, which can be sensitive and easy to bruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stage 2, the skin is more visibly pebbly or dimpled, and in stage 3 larger irregular fat deposits can form around thighs and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoedema can cause joint pain and heaviness in the affected limbs, and in the later stages it can lead to more severe mobility and joint issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body changes caused by lipoedema can also lead to self-esteem issues, and feelings of shame, embarrassment, anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dFHvfU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/54/lipoedema.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/54/lipoedema.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/10/54/lipoedema.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lipoedema can vary in severity" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-482ou5-1 dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-13845"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Lipoedema can vary in severity&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Wikimedia/Borgardottir)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is a condition that affects body fat, because the fat cells in lipoedema are disordered, dieting and exercise do not affect it the same way those measures help with normal fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while lipoedema cannot be cured with diet, it’s still good to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regime as it can help prevent the condition from getting worse, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lipoedema/"&gt;according to the NHS.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there is also no cure, but there are some treatments that can help manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compression garments can help manage the condition for people who feel pain and heaviness from it, and they also help support the joints and can reduce swelling. Manual lymphatic drainage can also relieve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liposuction is also a treatment option, but it is not often available on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoedema UK says there is also a difference between cosmetic liposuction and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lipoedema.co.uk/liposuction/"&gt;non-cosmetic liposuction&lt;/a&gt; used to treat lipoedema, and that the cosmetic version could cause long-term damage to affected areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisation also notes liposuction was rarely a one-off treatment, and some patients would need to wear compression garments long-term following the procedure to maintain the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/liposuction/"&gt;NHS says&lt;/a&gt;: “If you're considering having liposuction for cosmetic reasons, think very carefully before you go ahead. It can be expensive, the results cannot be guaranteed, and there are risks to consider. Speak to your GP about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you think you have Lipoedema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoedema UK says it can also be difficult to get a diagnosis because there is limited medical understanding about the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2021 survey by the organisation found that while 57 per cent of respondents had experienced symptoms from puberty, only 2 per cent had received a diagnosis. The majority said they didn’t get a diagnosis until after 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this Lipoedema UK says it is important for women to get an early diagnosis so they can begin to manage symptoms in the best way for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people with Lipoedema describe a feeling of relief when they receive their diagnosis, because it acknowledges that their symptoms are not the result of lifestyle choices,” Lipoedema UK says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisation suggests tracking symptoms and gathering as much information as possible about the condition before booking in with your GP, who may then refer you to a specialist service including a lymphoedema clinic - these specialist services can also help people manage lipoedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some private clinics could also help diagnose and support people who believe they have lipoedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNX2RwSXZ3ejcwSnNmeTNUX0w4NklvWjVyRmcwR05Cb2N4TEFTWTlOMGRhcU5kWTdxNEdZTTN2UXpMMWg5WllFeXdINHZ0WFlSb2l1V1F3X3BCUXJVck9CR0pLWjRoMzBCb0UzTTNEdjZRQmJFRjduTGxIQjVySTBQZWRqdVhMQnVJdnJ5UExxeWFDNVJZUWRNZnJScEpXd1FRRU14NWRSemlWN2tvU0hHUVdR</guid></item><item><title>Hard Turn: Getting sober-ish with Katie - KOMO News</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SEATTLE — &lt;/span&gt;Curious about changing your drinking habits or exploring sobriety?

&lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to “triggers” that leave you feeling angry, sad or anxious — “glimmers” can swing you in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deb Dana, an author and licensed clinical social worker who specializes in complex trauma, coined the term “glimmers” in her 2018 book &lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPolyvagal-Theory-Therapy-Interpersonal-Neurobiology%2Fdp%2F0393712370%2F%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F19%2Fhealth%2Ftrauma-experts-glimmers-technique-can-help-regulate-mood%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;“The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy”&lt;/a&gt; to describe how small experiences can help shift our nervous system’s response from defense to calm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Post, she broke down how to recognize them — and what to do when you’ve found one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Glimmers were born from Dana’s work treating complex trauma survivors. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is a glimmer?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Glimmers are these tiny moments of OK-ness, joy, excitement, ease, calm, any of those flavors that give you the feeling that you are safe enough in the world to feel present and OK,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you’ve bumped up against a glimmer?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You may feel something happen in your body, a warmth or an openness or breath change, or your eyes might focus on something. It may bring a slight smile. So there’s there’s an embodied response,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brain follows suit with its own response, recognizing that something is beautiful or fun or that it likes it: “It’s a body-brain experience, and they work together,” Dana noted.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What do you do when you notice a glimmer?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For beginners, Dana says that reflecting at the end of the day can help you recognize cues that moments were or could have been glimmers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Once you know the cues, when you feel something come alive, stop in that moment and then appreciate it. Appreciation is a 10- to 20-second experience,” Dana added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This brevity makes glimmers approachable for those working through complex trauma and anyone who wants to lead a happier, more emotionally regulated life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People want to feel like they’re doing something, and yet they don’t have a lot of energy to &lt;em&gt;be doing&lt;/em&gt;,” Dana noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though they’re short, glimmers can have a mighty, cumulative effect, expanding our biological capacity to avoid fight or flight, disassociation or shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we can stay regulated, we can talk with people, to connect with people, to problem solve, to be with whatever is causing despair or disruption in the world, and find a way to work with it rather than simply be pulled into it,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glimmer: the anti-trigger&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We deal all the time with triggers, the things that disregulate people,” Dana said. “We tend to forget that we also need to actively experience moments of OK-ness in order to fully live a life of well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In effect, glimmers function not as a distraction from suffering but as a building block of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we find glimmers, when we can notice them and soak them in, it builds our capacity for staying in that biological state of regulation,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;#Glimmers has also resonated with the world, with over 27 million posts on TikTok dedicated to the hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Deb Dana chose the word “glimmer” to suggest something attention-getting that is not overwhelming. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;YouTube / Sounds True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Teach your brain to feel better&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana chose the word glimmer as it suggests something attention-getting that is not overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The interesting thing about glimmers is they’re all around us; there is a glimmer happening somewhere all the time, and yet we don’t know to look for them, and so we don’t notice them, and they pass us by,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we begin to understand that it’s just the tiny moment that brings a smile or stops you for a moment, you look and feel something different,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, glimmers are a few seconds of feeling something different. As you find them more and more, you build the practice; you see, stop and appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Deb Dana&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking for glimmers conditions the mind and body to experience similar moments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once you find a glimmer and you feel it come alive in your body, your brain makes a story about it. It marks it, it names it. Once that happens, you are organically primed to look for more. So it becomes an easy practice,” Dana added.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She noted that there’s a fair amount of toxic positivity in the clinical world that urges people to count their blessings and eschew the negative. Yet Dana views glimmers as a way to confront difficulties rather than deny them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Glimmers are a way to resource your capacity to look toward what is difficult and distressing.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It’s about building the capacity to work with what disregulates us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;See, stop, appreciate, remember and share&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people whose everyday experiences include cues of danger, distress or chaos, the feeling of being regulated and safe can register as unfamiliar, sending a danger cue to the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the beginning, glimmers are a few seconds of feeling something different. As you find them more and more, you build the practice; you see, stop and appreciate,” Dana said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dana views glimmers as a pathway to confront difficulties rather than an escape from them. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“As we do this, those moments of safety and connection become familiar, so they’re not scary. And your system begins to shape toward that sense of safety and connection and reduces the protection pathways. As we build the capacity for safety and connection, we can travel that pathway more easily and often,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana maintains that as we build a glimmer practice, we begin to identify glimmer environments where we are likely to experience them. She has designed the &lt;a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324082071" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“Glimmer Journal”&lt;/a&gt; to help people keep track of and savor their glimmers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She notes that sharing is a crucial component of the power of glimmers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The nervous system loves to be in connection with other nervous systems. We humans are social beings. We want to be with others. And so after we see, stop, appreciate and remember, the next step is share.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;span class="embed-youtube"&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Video" class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-naiAdVMzk?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en-US&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&amp;amp;listType=playlist&amp;amp;list=PLyOuAoSmZkKqizFuqHjKiW83ET1uvpycD" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glimmers: Sharing is caring&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In her work with complex trauma survivors, Dana would have clients share their glimmers in myriad ways, including recordings, drawings, photographs and lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She notes that glimmer buddies and groups are lovely ways to encourage the seeking and sharing of glimmers. “There are all sorts of ways to let the nervous system really feel connected and part of a glimmer community.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;According to Dana, when you share a glimmer, you bring it alive again in your own system and provide an opportunity for another person to experience that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while the goal with trauma is to remember rather than relive the experience, when it comes to glimmers, we should aim for an immersive recollection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That state of feeling that there is regulation and connection, we want to bring it as fully alive as our system can tolerate,” Dana said. “&lt;span&gt;Because the more we do that, the more it &lt;/span&gt;gently and yet powerfully shifts our system towards a new pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Dana, every moment is an opportunity to shape the nervous system and remain open to the positive potential of glimmers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we continue to have, share and remember glimmers, we know they’re shaping our systems toward more regulation, safety and connection. As I am a more regulated human, I am then passing that out into the world,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana added: “I’m walking through the world, giving other people cues of safety and welcome. I imagine that every time we begin to reshape our system and then pass that on to others, we’re beginning to shape the world in small but powerful ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

The medication, which can only be prescribed by a doctor, helps decrease cholesterol levels and lower the chances of developing heart disease and experiencing a stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in blood and cells. It's crucial for the body's normal functioning, but having an excess can increase the risk of heart disease. Cholesterol plays a key role in creating protective layers around cell membranes, producing hormones, vitamin D, and compounds that aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is carried through your blood by lipoproteins, particles made of fat and protein. There are two main types of lipoproteins - Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is known as 'bad' cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is sometimes called 'good' cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When cholesterol levels are high, plaque builds up in the arteries. This buildup is called atherosclerosis, and it can lead to heart problems, including blood clots, angina, coronary artery disease and restricted blood flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your risk is quite low, you likely won't require a statin unless your LDL levels exceed 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L). However, if your risk is significantly high, such as having experienced a heart attack before, a statin could be beneficial even if your cholesterol levels are not elevated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31036759" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's no magic solution for lowering cholesterol. You can't rely on just one food or meal to make a difference. Some individuals will need medication to control their high cholesterol. In contrast, others may benefit from making lifestyle adjustments which can help reduce high cholesterol and potentially decrease their likelihood of needing medical treatment like statins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While statins are commonly used to manage cholesterol levels, various other approaches can effectively lower cholesterol. The most suitable treatment for high cholesterol varies based on multiple factors. When considering a prescription medication, a doctor will evaluate several aspects, including your family medical history, heart disease risk, and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says: "If you're at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).in the near future, your doctor will usually recommend lifestyle changes to reduce this risk before they suggest that you take statins." Lifestyle changes that can reduce your cholesterol level and CVD risk include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;eating a healthy, balanced diet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;exercising regularly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining a healthy weight&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;limiting the amount of alcohol you drink&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stopping smoking&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, statins may be recommended if these measures do not help. Find out more about &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/statins/uses/" rel="nofollow"&gt;when statins may be recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ultimately, maintaining heart health involves regularly choosing heart-friendly foods and focusing on the overall quality of your diet.

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every meal focuses on foods that help lower cholesterol, featuring plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains such as oats and barley, plant-based proteins like beans and chickpeas, and healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, and seeds. These ingredients are fibre-rich, heart-friendly fats and various nutrients supporting cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For snacks, avoid processed and packaged foods. Whole foods like fruit, plain yoghurt, nuts, and seeds are better options. You could cut up slices of carrot or cucumber to dip into hummus or roast chickpeas for something with more crunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To maintain healthy levels of 'bad' cholesterol, it's important to boost your consumption of soluble fibre in foods such as oats, beans, apples, and pears. Opt for lean protein options like fish, chicken, and tofu. Be mindful of saturated and trans fats often in processed foods, red meat, and butter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, include healthy fats like avocados and nuts in moderation, and prefer whole grains instead of refined carbs. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days, and consider incorporating strength training to enhance muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important points to remember:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's important to talk to your doctor about your cholesterol levels and any lifestyle adjustments you’re considering to find the best approach for your specific situation. Check your cholesterol regularly to monitor how your lifestyle changes affect your levels. Although some supplements, such as fish oil, might offer benefits, it's always a good idea to consult your doctor before starting any supplement for cholesterol management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although some supplements, such as fish oil, might offer benefits, it's always a good idea to consult your doctor before starting any supplement for cholesterol management. If you choose to change your diet and lifestyle first, you will need to commit to it until your cholesterol levels drop down, and then you'll need to keep it up or risk medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Natural remedies can also help lower cholesterol levels, including psyllium, artichoke extract, oat bran, garlic and barley. However, they should complement lifestyle changes rather than replace them. You can easily incorporate these remedies into your diet with your doctor's consent. Remember to keep taking any medications prescribed by your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQOXFsajJJQVZUbktYSHhKTEp2Y2pEX0JmUTlpbjhEZHNtWDl6YnF1Njh2UVdaRW5IcmhFMkY1SmdOMFdtLVNYNXV6RjdpLTZGbGdYWWpETUFXMHRCYUJmaGhwZmFncVNTckZhZ0lsZnhmY3RHaTMzcXkzRzZHd0U0N0FOaUdpdw</guid></item><item><title>Why do we twitch in our sleep? - Vox.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5EVTV6Q19hckdidlNva3RPZHJVbUQxZXFvckdyNlBULWNZN2JBSHpBU01qdTI5UW1Va0gtd0NNYnJkaVI1dUtlRGwwRmU4SHRzaUFKTktEdTFKa0Qwb0xWR1cyN1BDdlBoOGVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrixz"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ever wondered what your pets are dreaming about when they suddenly kick their paws in their sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Maybe they’re chasing a mouse, or a cat. Maybe they’re pawing at you for treats. Or, maybe they’re just running around the house, rummaging through the garbage, scratching the couch, jumping on beds — all the things they’re not allowed to do when they’re awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s hard to say. But one thing is for sure: People have been connecting these sudden twitches to dreams in animals, and in humans, for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In humans, during the deepest stage of sleep, we have twitches in our limbs but also in our eyes. These are called rapid eye movements, REM for short. And, the science here is pretty certain. REM sleep is when we are likely dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In animals, scientists also believe their twitching limbs is a likely sign of them dreaming as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I mean, we know we have dreams. We know that we are moving around in our dreams to some extent,” says &lt;a href="https://psychology.uiowa.edu/people/mark-blumberg"&gt;Mark Blumberg&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa. “So it just makes sense to think, ‘Oh, movements. Why wouldn’t they be connected?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But then, he observed twitching in really young animals and asked, “A newborn animal has had very little waking risk experiences. What the hell are they dreaming about?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If twitching was really related to dreaming, you’d expect that the older you get and the more experiences you have, the more you’d dream, and the more you’d twitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, to get to the bottom of this mystery, Blumberg began experimenting on newborn rats. In a study, he surgically disconnected the part of the brain responsible for creating dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We found no effect at all on twitches. And so I was like, ‘Okay, what is this about?’” If dreams were responsible for twitching, why did cutting the part of the brain responsible for them have no effect? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Blumberg spoke with &lt;em&gt;Unexplainable&lt;/em&gt; host Noam Hassenfeld about how this seemingly small question — why do we twitch in our sleep? — has fundamentally shifted how we understand the relationship between the brain and the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Is that different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s a separate phenomenon. It’s more akin to what’s called a startle than a twitch. You’re not in REM sleep when that happens, and there are a lot of theories about it, but the fact is it’s an extremely hard thing to study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, if we’re just talking about these REM sleep twitches, then how common are they? Do all kinds of animals and people twitch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ve got a website that collects all these different videos, and what you see across different animals is that the parts of the body that the animals really, really rely on for bringing sensory information into their brain are the parts that twitch the most. So for us, you know, rapid eye movements are twitches of the eyes. We also twitch our fingers a lot when we’re adults. With cats, you see their paws moving a lot. Ferrets, you see whisker twitches; rats, you see lots of whisker twitches. They use their whiskers to learn about the world just as well as we use our eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And if all of these twitches aren’t just, you know, enacting dreams, how do you start figuring out what they actually are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, you know, the first thing you have to do is try to figure out what parts of the brain are producing this. I mean, how is this all happening? And what we started to see when we were recording brain activity is that the brains of neonates, baby rats, were much more active during sleep and much more active when animals were twitching than when they were awake, It’s one thing to think that sleep has brain activity associated with it. That was a huge finding 80 years ago. It’s another thing entirely to see that the brain activity is greater. And I mean much greater during REM sleep than during waking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I assume it’s reasonable to think that all of that brain activity is connected with these twitches, right? Is there a way to actually test it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, I mean, the biggest problem was methodological. How do you record brain activity in a very, very small baby rat, which was the best animal for doing this sort of work. You have to figure out how to get them in a stable situation so you can drop these very fine electrodes into the brain. And so it took years to get the methods going. But what we started to see is that every time the animal twitches, 10 milliseconds later, the part of the brain that’s responsive to sensory input for that limb shows a huge burst of activity. So twitch, activity. Twitch, activity. Not the other way around. This is a sensory signal, right? So this timing here matters. If you have a twitch, and then you get a burst of activity in the brain after that twitch, then you have a pretty good idea that that’s a sensory signal that you’re picking up on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, so like a signal the brain is getting from a nerve or a muscle or something?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, the sensory input. So every time you move a limb, you have sensors in your muscle, you have sensors in your skin and your joints. And those sensors, when you have movement, they produce neural signals that flow up into the brain. That’s how we know when our arms are moving or when you touch something. We have sensors all throughout our limbs. And so when the limbs were moving, that’s when we were seeing the brain activity in parts of the brain that are responsive to those types of sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. Okay, so you’re essentially flipping the traditional hypothesis on its head, right? It’s not dreams causing twitches, it’s twitches causing dreams, or it’s twitches causing some impact in the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, I mean, obviously twitches are not going to be the sole source of all things in the dreaming brain, but that it is at least providing sensory input to the brain during sleep, that we know for a fact. So it does flip it on its head and it completely changes the calculus of what’s happening in a dreaming brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So then why would the twitching be happening to begin with? Like, what’s the point of all of this twitching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, so this is where you have to start to think about what is it that’s special about twitches, right? The first thing that you notice is that the movements are discrete. And it turns out that discreteness is incredibly important. So imagine that you’re standing at a switchboard with hundreds of different switches. Let’s just say they’re neurons, and then all the wires from all of those switches lead to a whole bunch of lights. So every switch controls a different light, okay? And let’s say that those lights are muscles. If you’re sitting at that switchboard and you want to figure out which switches control which lights, you don’t just start throwing all the switches simultaneously, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Because if you did, you’re gaining no information. All you’re seeing is a bunch of lights turn on and you’ve thrown a bunch of switches. The answer is you throw one switch at a time, you see which light comes on, and then you make that connection. And so that’s the difference between wake movements and twitches. You know, I’m sitting here talking to you, and I’m gesturing, and I’m moving all my limbs simultaneously, my posture, my neck, my eyes, everything’s moving simultaneously, right? That’s waking. One of the characteristics of waking movements is that they’re continuous, and they’re simultaneous, and they’re highly complex. But when you’re twitching, one twitch at a time, you ping your body. And the body pings you back. And then you know that the first thing is related to the second thing and that’s the discreteness of twitching. And that explains why these animals are twitching so much. You never grow and develop more than you do when you are young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, your theory is that the power goes out and they’re flipping switches in a fuse box to see which switch controls which light because there’s no other stimuli coming in, right? They’re in a controlled environment, so they’re essentially doing sort of an experiment to learn their own body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, exactly. It’s like they’re bootstrapping their system. They’re self-organizing their sensory motor system and it’s done from within. It’s a big mystery as to how we develop things like our sensory motor system. How do you actually learn about your body when you’re a newborn rat or a human and you’re born, you have no idea how your body is formed. You have no idea how it moves, and it’s going to be changing every single day as you grow and figure out new things, right? So how do you figure out how to move that body in real time through the process of development? You can’t prescribe this. You can’t blueprint this. There’s no genetic mechanism that can tell you exactly how you’re going to be on day three versus day five. So you need to have a system that’s highly adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And if twitching is about learning, we would assume younger animals would twitch more, is that the case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then, I mean, older animals also twitch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why would they be twitching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Good question. First, we don’t twitch as much when we’re older. But second, some animals do twitch quite a lot. And the part of the body that twitches matters. And this is just a theory because nobody has really explored it with the level of sophistication that we need. But we have to calibrate our systems, you know, over the day we get tired, we lose control, you know, our vision gets worse and worse through the day. And then you wake up the next day and you’re rejuvenated. I think it’s possible that twitches continue throughout life, for some parts of the body, for that purpose; to calibrate a weary system. And there’s some hints out there in the world that this could be happening, including work that was done in humans. But they’re mostly hints and it needs to be done more systematically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And why do you think the scientific community missed this for so long, missed understanding twitches as a developmental process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Because when you label something as a byproduct of dreams, why would anybody spend their time studying it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like, it’s just closing off further inquiry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah, I mean, I don’t want to be too flippant about it. Dreams are fascinating, but they’re kind of a red herring when it comes to studying sleep. There is, to my mind, many, many fascinating things about sleep that have nothing to do with dreams, and the focus on dreams is kind of a distraction from what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE5EVTV6Q19hckdidlNva3RPZHJVbUQxZXFvckdyNlBULWNZN2JBSHpBU01qdTI5UW1Va0gtd0NNYnJkaVI1dUtlRGwwRmU4SHRzaUFKTktEdTFKa0Qwb0xWR1cyN1BDdlBoOGVn</guid></item><item><title>Drug for diabetes and kidney disease may also lower heart attack, stroke risks - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQbDhQM3hDV3RiME1hMEF2cHFDQmd2VHN3c3FrTXRjY0ZSaE5mSy1CMGF4LVl1WWUzWFcxUHlnTUtOOWdKWUROM2lyT3Q3M2lRaWlKVnB4SGlXWk4xWHVvSWdxTGh3bVBKRnFEejY1X1RCXzdDUC1FLTU2YndsZlJOeHFLWUw4MEx4ejVLSDl0enlJcXc5WFBEUDVBVUFJSWMtOXNfZmRiTDN6ZHg1b2Z0Vg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="An older adult man out in a sports field, looking to the side" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="css-90fpmc icon-hl-pinterest css-by55vd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fdrug-diabetes-kidney-disease-may-also-lower-heart-attack-stroke-risks&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F02%2Fsenior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Type%202%20diabetes%20drug%20may%20lower%20heart%20attack%2C%20stroke%20risk%20by%2023%25" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/senior-man-sports-field-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;A drug already used to treat people who have diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease could have added heart disease benefits, too.

Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA&lt;/a&gt;, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and the Dr. Valentin Fuster Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and lead author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw a significant benefit in terms of fewer &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and adverse kidney events.

This multi-pronged approach could lead to a substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk in eligible patients who are treated with this medication.” &lt;br&gt;— Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the next steps for this research, Bhatt said that sotagliflozin should be studied in other populations at high risk for heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those would need to be large, long-term trials, so we would need to find someone to fund such research,” he continued. “In the meantime, smaller basic science experiments are ongoing to examine the biological actions of blocking SGLT1 receptors that may explain sotagliflozin’s unique ability (among the SGLT inhibitor class of drugs) to reduce heart attack and stroke risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/interventional-cardiology/ca/santa-monica/michael-broukhim-1609064880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michael Broukhim, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified interventional cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“SGLT2 inhibitors have become an important part of our treatment of patients with heart failure,” Broukhim said. “If sotagliflozin has the added benefit of reduction in myocardial infarction and stroke, we may wish to use this agent more to treat high risk patients.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with type 2 diabetes or kidney disease have significantly elevated risks for heart attack and stroke despite our available treatments.

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The majority of cases are among school-age children &lt;/strong&gt;and, according to the state health department, most of the patients are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccine status. Measles can be dangerous, &lt;a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1232435562:x" target="_blank"&gt;especially for babies and children&lt;/a&gt;, Samantha Larned of NPR network station KTTZ tells &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;. In Gaines County, where many cases have been reported, health officials have described the communities as "vaccine hesitant." The vaccination rate there is just under 82%, compared to the state's 90% rate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As President Trump's administration pushes efforts to shrink&lt;/strong&gt; the federal government, some in China see the U.S.' cuts to pro-democracy and human rights groups abroad as an opportunity to gain more power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;NPR's Emily Feng has discovered that people with the Chinese government have approached &lt;/strong&gt;at least two U.S. human rights organizations focused on issues related to China. These individuals have offered to connect the organizations with financial backers based in China. The groups at risk of losing their funding include those that China and other authoritarian governments criticize, such as women's rights organizations and legal aid nonprofits. Some human rights advocates are &lt;a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1232435562:x" target="_blank"&gt;concerned about a growing alignment between&lt;/a&gt; how the Trump administration discusses democracy work and how authoritarian regimes frame the same topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been charged&lt;/strong&gt; by Brazil's attorney general with attempting to overturn the country's 2022 election. Bolsonaro, the former far-right leader, is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5301208/brazils-former-president-faces-charges-over-alleged-coup-plot" target="_blank"&gt;accused of plotting a coup&lt;/a&gt; to stay in power, inciting violence and hatching a plan to poison the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;Bolsonaro has denied the allegations against him&lt;/strong&gt;, NPR's Carrie Kahn says. He also says the legal fight against him is a &lt;a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1232435562:x" target="_blank"&gt;similar strategy used against Trump&lt;/a&gt;, which he has pointed out failed. The nearly 900-page long report for the investigation is based on testimonies, phone records and plea deals with close allies of Bolsonaro. Additionally, there are hundreds of cases against rioters who were charged with ransacking the capital on Jan. 8, 2023. If convicted, Kahn says Bolsonaro faces anywhere between 12 years and four decades in prison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deep dive&lt;/h3&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Broken heart syndrome is more than just a metaphorical idea. Also known as stress cardiomyopathy, the real condition can bring on a sudden and dramatic weakening of heart muscle. It often strikes after a stressful event and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/17/nx-s1-5292139/health-stress-cardiomyopathy-heart-attack" target="_blank"&gt;can be tricky to diagnose&lt;/a&gt;. Some tests performed in the ER can show the same results as someone having a heart attack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💔 When a person has a heart attack, they have a blockage in one or more of their coronary arteries. This is a key difference from broken heart syndrome, which doesn't involve blocked arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💔 When the heart is weakened, blood and oxygen can't effectively circulate throughout the body, resulting in the symptoms. It is unclear why some develop this rare condition after a stressful event.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💔 The syndrome is most common in women over the age of 50, though cardiologists have reported seeing the condition in a broad range of patients. Most patients make a full recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The IRS started accepting tax returns on Jan. 27. Within the first week of filing, around 28% of the 11.7 million returns processed resulted in direct deposit refunds. By the April 15 federal deadline, the agency expects to receive over 140 million individual returns.

Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This bar chart from the study shows the role of environmental and lifestyle factors (green segment) in influencing a host of diseases compared to genetic risk factors (yellow) and age and sex (purple). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts hailed the results of the study for highlighting the importance of tackling changeable factors like poverty, to improve the nation's health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and living conditions were the biggest modifiable factors influencing health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking was as associated with 22 diseases, while factors such as household income, home ownership, and employment, living in a deprived area, and tiredness were associated with 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise levels and hours of sleep and being 'plumper' as a child were linked to 17 diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also found having a mother who smoked, and being overweight or obese at the age of 10 could influence risk of premature death 30-80 years later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One outlier was dementia — where genetic risk was found to be far more influential on the likelihood of death from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only roughly 10 per cent of dementia risk is thought to lie with modifiable environmental factors, the researchers suggested. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Cornelia van Duijn, an expert in epidemiology and senior author of the paper, said the research demonstrated the power policy could have other factors that influence our health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate ageing early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that previous work in this field has tended to focus on one specific lifestyle factor, like smoking, rather than a range of factors working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analysed levels of protein in volunteers' blood to assess how people were ageing biologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can show a person is ageing faster than their chronological age, the number of birthdays they've had, would suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting Professor Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation said: ‘Your income, postcode and background shouldn’t determine your chances of living a long and healthy life. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We urgently need bold action from Government to target the surmountable barriers to good health that too many people in the UK are facing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Felicity Gavins, an expert in pharmacology at Brunel University of London, also welcomed the 'exciting study'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fact that most of the risk factors identified are modifiable highlights an enormous opportunity for prevention,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By addressing social inequalities, promoting healthy behaviours and reducing harmful exposures, we can really make a meaningful difference in reducing age-related diseases and premature mortality.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stephen Burgess, an expert in biostatistics at the University of Cambridge, added: '(The study) provides further demonstration supporting previous research that, in the majority of cases, our genes do not determine our future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are exceptions, including rare conditions that are caused by a single genetic variation, but for the majority of conditions that Western people die from, disease risk is more strongly attributable to modifiable risk factors and our wider environment, as shaped by our upbringing and choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Genetics can load the dice, but it is up to us how we play our hand.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has a number of limitations critically that it was observational meaning it cannot be proven any particular factor influenced an individual's chance of suffering from a condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results come just a day after concerning research suggested bulging waistlines in England have caused the country's&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14409773/England-life-expectancy-rankings-calculator-long-live.html"&gt; life expectancy to plunge in the European life expectancy rankings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After decades of progress, attempts to keep people living longer are beginning to fail, with people in England now living roughly nine months less than they did in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:16:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Is This the Tipping Point to Slash Salt in Our Diet - Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOM1hrejFVVkNfbFZZdm42eGhPaTJhSWZpM0hwc2M5RHVldHJ2WmZ4Z1RGNGFRV0dGbjhXaC12MjBMNTNOc1BEbTAydXZPQ3h0V3NEcEtSS05QbzdTVVNUZXliZ3JBNGhFRHVCQkNBdWpEcWd3bGhzbktVNzI4MExsUVNnazJhTFJYRFhMVG9YQVlCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A teaspoon of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the amount of sodium that US dietary guidelines recommend that people consume a day. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet"&gt;salt consumption&lt;/a&gt; is often higher than the recommended amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression of evidence about the effect of salt on cardiovascular health has marched forward from studies showing a reduction in consumption associated with lower blood pressure to clinical trials confirming cause-and-effect and now, a new incentive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent data from a subset of the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2829790"&gt;Salt Substitute and Stroke Study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that a salt alternative with 25% potassium reduced the risk for recurrent stroke and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators of the randomized study led by Xiong Ding, MPH, with the School of Public Health at Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, reported that those reductions came with no greater risk for hyperkalemia, which has been a safety concern with salt substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking Double-Digit Percentage Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a 14% reduction in stroke and 12% decrease in death, "The simple intervention of salt substitution could significantly improve secondary prevention of stroke and cardiovascular health on a global scale," the &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/salt-substitutes-cut-risk-stroke-recurrence-death-2025a10002w9"&gt;investigators reported&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; on February 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that table salt is not the biggest problem, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet"&gt;70% of dietary sodium&lt;/a&gt; comes from eating packaged and prepared foods. The agency says it is working with the food industry "to make reasonable reductions in sodium across a wide variety of foods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2829794?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2024.5417"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the new trial result, editorialists led by Daniel W. Jones, MD, with the Department of Medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, call this "the tipping point" for evidence that lower sodium consumption can improve health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When skeptics are asked what it would take for mandatory sodium reductions to be enforced, the editorialists point out, the common response is "a clinical trial demonstrating that a reduction in dietary sodium caused a reduction in cardiovascular events." The new data, combined with other results, could be the proof needed to move recommendations toward requirements for sodium reduction in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, the World Health Organization released &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sodium-reduction#:~:text=For%20adults%2C%20WHO%20recommends%20less%20than%202000%20mg%2Fday,adult%20dose%20downward%20based%20on%20their%20energy%20requirements."&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommending reducing sodium intake to less than one teaspoon a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, 8 million deaths worldwide are linked with poor diet, reports the WHO, and 1.9 million of those deaths can be attributed to high sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So are we reaching an evidence-based tipping point for regulating sodium? Cardiologist Melissa Tracy, MD, a professor at Rush University in Chicago, told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;, "Definitively, with capital letters, a shout-out, yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health improvements in reducing sodium have been demonstrated in a number of studies, she said, and the current trial adds significant health benefits in stroke and mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you start getting into double-digit reductions in stroke, double-digit reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, major reduction in death," she said, "that's huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Trans Fat, Food Dye Moment for Salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105675"&gt;original Salt Substitute and Stroke Study&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2021 in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Tracy says she has made a point of telling her patients about the benefits of salt substitutes, and she shows them the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracy keeps a container of salt substitute in her office to show an example of what it looks like and that it's inexpensive — almost the same cost as regular salt — and is easy to get with groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial has also shown no adverse events from increasing potassium levels with salt substitutes, she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has to be a health regulation," Tracy added, "just as we got rid of trans fats. Just as we're trying to get colors removed from foods. Patients who have risks, specifically high blood pressure, can't even eat out without their blood pressure shooting up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracy recalls the conclusions of the authors of the 2021 study, who noted, "The magnitude of protection observed in this trial is similar to that assumed in a recent modeling study that estimated 365,000 strokes, 461,000 premature deaths, and 1,204,000 vascular events could be averted each year by the population-wide use of a salt substitute in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's "huge value to this," Tracy said. "It’s lives saved. It's quality of life improvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many in the scientific and public health communities have argued the evidence has been insufficient to warrant new salt reduction strategies — including the use of government regulation to limit sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Laffin, MD, a cardiologist with the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, says he would welcome government restrictions on the amounts of sodium in foods, but he doesn't see that happening anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings from the subset of this trial add to the evidence, there are still some questions science hasn't answered yet, said Laffin, who is co-director of the Center for Blood Pressure Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are always going to be concerns about what to substitute sodium with, he pointed out. "In this trial, it's potassium chloride. It does have potential dangers, particularly in people with kidney disease and other issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we're at a point where the FDA would ever legislate this," he said, adding that the agency has supported voluntary reduction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Education About Food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major sodium studies, including this latest one, have been conducted in countries outside the United States, Laffin pointed out. "You have to remember that Asian populations have a much higher amount of sodium in their diets than a typical North American population," he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has the &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/salt-consumption-by-country"&gt;world's highest consumption&lt;/a&gt; of sodium, and the average daily sodium consumption among Chinese adults is more than two teaspoons of salt a day, even though Chinese Dietary Guidelines recommend well &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-023-00861-7"&gt;under a teaspoon&lt;/a&gt; a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is the effect going to be as prominent in a North American population? It's unknown," Laffin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Salt reduction is the number one thing we should be talking about to our patients at high cardiovascular risk, particularly those with hypertension," he said. "But I think it would take more than [the new research findings] to legislate in the United States that manufacturers must have low sodium content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium is so ubiquitous in the US food supply that limiting it "would be very challenging to do. A typical piece of bread has sodium in it," Laffin added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can be done is better consumer education for making food choices, he said. In his practice, Laffin says he asks patients whether they track the amount of salt they are eating, and a common response he hears is that they don't add sodium from the saltshaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But less than about 3% of the average person's daily sodium intake is from the saltshaker," he said. "It's mostly in the things we're eating, be it bread or cheeses or salad dressings." And "we know that anything from the deli counter is just jam-packed with sodium." Laffin says he reminds patients that reading labels is crucial in tracking salt consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also giving patients a quantifiable number to aim for with daily sodium intake, rather than instructing them to just watch their salt, will help, he says. They may think that by avoiding foods like chips and pizza, they are doing enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says giving patients a bit of wiggle room may help them better adhere to a healthy plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association reports the ideal amount of sodium for at-risk patients is about half a teaspoon a day or 1500 mg, which is even lower than typical dietary guidelines, Laffin points out. "That's great if someone can achieve that, but 2300 mg is also a reasonable target because the difference in blood pressure reduction between 2300 and 1500 mg of sodium is only a few blood pressure points," he said. "So you can get more buy-in from patients if it's 2300 or less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other less well-known ways to reduce salt, Laffin said, include asking fast-food restaurants to make your meal without salt and then adding it yourself, if needed, or skipping salt altogether, he said. The no-salt choice is showing up on food delivery apps as well as in restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracy and Laffin declared no relevant financial relationships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOM1hrejFVVkNfbFZZdm42eGhPaTJhSWZpM0hwc2M5RHVldHJ2WmZ4Z1RGNGFRV0dGbjhXaC12MjBMNTNOc1BEbTAydXZPQ3h0V3NEcEtSS05QbzdTVVNUZXliZ3JBNGhFRHVCQkNBdWpEcWd3bGhzbktVNzI4MExsUVNnazJhTFJYRFhMVG9YQVlCdw</guid></item><item><title>Bird Flu Outbreak Continues to Spread - The Dispatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNWjVHRGljOWZLYUVxRWswQjNNeHVMMjVLQjNjZnpycjdvN05CWWVReWN1ck9jV1pNczZEWnJNUEtSeVlscGUxQTVnV1BMVmY0WUxfc0hIZ19FbXdSZTM2dXBCLThtQWt2Rnkwc3c2Q2FvT1YzekZPQlRNd2hGUjhzTUNJOURwanlx?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/us-russia-talks-ukraine-europe-invasion-rcna192544"&gt;indicated Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the United States and Russia had agreed to restaff their respective embassies. His announcement followed the first day of high-level talks between Russian and American officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine and improving U.S.-Russia cooperation. The State Department &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-rubios-meeting-with-russian-foreign-minister-lavrov/"&gt;laid out&lt;/a&gt; plans to pursue “historic economic and investment opportunities” with Russia after the fighting has ceased and &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-national-security-advisor-mike-waltz-and-special-envoy-to-the-middle-east-steve-witkoff-with-jennifer-hansler-of-cnn-and-matthew-lee-of-the-associated-press/"&gt;alluded to&lt;/a&gt; the possibility of lifting sanctions on the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3299219/ukraines-zelensky-postpones-saudi-visit-not-give-legitimacy-us-russia-meeting"&gt;reportedly postponed&lt;/a&gt; a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to avoid giving the negotiations—to which he said he initially hadn’t been invited—“legitimacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Hamas negotiator on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages-to-release-bibas-family-intl/index.html"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to return the bodies of four murdered hostages to Israel on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/middleeast/bibas-bodies-death-hamas-israel-exchange.html"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; Shiri Bibas and her two young boys, Ariel and Kfir. Terrorists abducted the mother and children from their Nir Oz home on October 7, 2023, along with Shiri’s husband Yarden, who was separated from his family during the attack and released this month as part of the ongoing U.S.-brokered, three-phase ceasefire deal. Israel has yet to confirm the remaining family members’ deaths, but expressed “grave concerns” about their status last month. Kfir was the youngest abductee at just 9 months old at the time of his kidnapping. Hamas also &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-to-release-6-living-hostages-on-saturday-after-returning-4-bodies-thursday/"&gt;said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it would free the six remaining living hostages slated for release in the first stage of the deal on Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;

Elon Musk’s commission has in recent weeks &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/treasury-inspector-general-audit-doge-musk-democrats-d1e2710d0b63f54a8c1fe50fe4f23d4d"&gt;accessed&lt;/a&gt; the Treasury Department’s payment system and is now &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/musk-irs-doge.html"&gt;attempting&lt;/a&gt; to obtain sensitive taxpayer data at the Internal Revenue Service as part of DOGE’s ostensible push to audit the federal government. With King’s departure, the White House &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/17/politics/social-security-head-steps-down-doge-access/index.html"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; appointed SSA employee Leland Dudek to take over as acting commissioner of the independent agency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postmaster General Louis DeJoy &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-steps-down-a064a797"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday to resign from his position atop the U.S. Postal Service, though he didn’t specify the date of his departure. DeJoy’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/19/trump-louis-dejoy-usps/"&gt;followed reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump administration was looking into candidates to replace him, though the postmaster general is typically chosen by an independent governing board. President Donald Trump had also floated the possibility of privatizing the federal agency, which &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usps-lost-almost-10-billion-2024-postmaster-louis-dejoy-postage/#:~:text=The%20USPS%20said%20it%20lost,noncash%20contributions%20to%20worker%20compensation."&gt;lost $9.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024 fiscal year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jim Jones, the head of the Food and Drug Administration’s food division, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-food-division-head-jim-jones-resigns-rcna192589"&gt;resigned from his post&lt;/a&gt; on Monday in response to the Trump administration’s sweeping layoffs. Of the 2,000 employees in his division, 89 people—including new staffers hired to investigate the risk of chemicals in the food industry—were affected by cuts that Jones &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/food-head-at-fda-resigns-citing-numerous-job-cuts-in-division"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as “indiscriminate” in a resignation letter. “The secretary’s comments impugning the integrity of the food staff, asserting they are corrupt based on falsities, is a disservice to everyone,” he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/fda-food-safety-jim-jones-resignation.html"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; of newly confirmed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s past &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/health/robert-kennedy-jr-fda.html"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; on the FDA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Senate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/howard-lutnick-confirmed-commerce.html"&gt;voted 51-45&lt;/a&gt; along party lines on Tuesday to confirm Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary. The former CEO of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick will be tasked with managing &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/howard-lutnick-trump-tariffs-commerce-department-9788590bbee10d09d3cb91822b0c9687"&gt;50,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; as he seeks to implement President Trump’s protectionist trade priorities. As a nominee, the billionaire signaled his support for tariffs and limited regulations on artificial intelligence development. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-border-patrol-arrested-29000-migrants-illegally-crossing-mexico-border-2025-02-18/"&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that immigration authorities apprehended some 29,000 people trying to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border in January—the lowest level since May 2020. The agency also &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-january-2025-monthly-update"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that illegal crossings between January 21 and January 31 had dropped 85 percent year-over-year. The largest number of monthly migrant apprehensions to date came in December 2023, at &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-border-crossings-on-track-to-reach-biden-era-low/"&gt;230,000 arrests&lt;/a&gt;, and has steadily decreased since. &lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the January consumer price index report dropped last week, it came with more bad news for breakfast lovers: a &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/why-are-eggs-so-expensive"&gt;record high&lt;/a&gt; for egg prices, which hit $4.95 for a dozen. Grocery stores across the country have begun imposing &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/grocery-stores-limit-egg-purchases-thefts-increase-bird-flu/story?id=118732180#:~:text=Stores%20enforce%20purchase,three%20per%20member."&gt;purchase limits&lt;/a&gt;, while criminals are carrying out &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/eggs-stolen-pennsylvania-100000-c1c260ca05b9f84612c61071cb504939"&gt;egg heists&lt;/a&gt;. And according to our own Scott Lincicome’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1890826431648711000"&gt;totally scientific scale&lt;/a&gt;, we’re currently at EGGCON 3—not yet an egg-istential crisis but still concerning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit? A now-yearslong outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus, which has forced farmers to kill tens of millions of infected and exposed birds. The flu made the jump to dairy cows last spring, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/m0106-h5-birdflu-death.html"&gt;first human death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States from the virus occurred last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While health authorities maintain that the bird flu currently represents a low risk to people, researchers warn the extended duration of the outbreak increases the potential of the virus mutating and leading to widespread human-to-human transmission. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signaled a forthcoming change in strategy as the government response thus far comes under fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 virus, which is most commonly found in birds, has circulated for decades since its discovery in 1996. The virus can spread via wild migratory flocks infected with the flu, making it challenging to contain. The virus has plagued commercial poultry farms since an outbreak in February 2022, and more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html#:~:text=159%2C307%2C978,from%20clade%202.3.4.4."&gt;159 million birds&lt;/a&gt; have died or been killed to stem the spread in the last three years. Poultry farmers across the country have been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/nyregion/long-island-duck-farm-bird-flu.html"&gt;hit hard&lt;/a&gt; with many of them losing all of their flocks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-hpai-indemnity-and-compensation.508.pdf"&gt;compensates&lt;/a&gt; farmers for birds that are culled after an outbreak has been detected, but not those that have died from the virus—a policy intended to incentivize farmers to detect and report outbreaks as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird flu can also &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;infect wild mammals&lt;/a&gt; as wide-ranging as mountain lions and bottlenose dolphins, but the jump to dairy cows for the first time last year is particularly concerning to some researchers. More than &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock"&gt;970 cow herds&lt;/a&gt; across 17 states have been infected with the virus. California, the nation’s largest milk producer, declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/docs/governors_proclamation_of_a_state_of_emergency_bird_flu_2024.pdf"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; in December as roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/HPAI.html#:~:text=California.%20Since%20California%27s%20first%20detection%20of%20H5N1%20Bird%20Flu%20in%20dairies%2C%20there%20have%20been%20a%20total%20of%20747%20infected%20dairies%20with%20297%20of%20those%20affected%2C%20fully%20recovered%20and%20released%20from%20quarantine."&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the state’s dairy herds contracted the virus. Infected dairy cows have a much lower mortality rate for the virus compared to chickens, but some cows experience reduced milk production even after recovering from the virus. Last April, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/2024-avian-influenza-ah5n1-dairy-cattle"&gt;first known case&lt;/a&gt; of mammal-to-human transmission of H5N1 came from a person in Texas exposed to dairy cows presumed to be infected with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s concerning is the spillover events to humans,” Isaac Bogoch, a tropical disease doctor and researcher at the University of Toronto, told &lt;strong&gt;TMD&lt;/strong&gt;. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;68 human cases&lt;/a&gt; of the virus so far, with the majority of them stemming from exposure to infected dairy cows and poultry. But a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published Thursday and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a3.htm"&gt;previous study&lt;/a&gt; from August suggested that the number of human cases could be much higher due to insufficient testing and cases where individuals don’t experience noticeable symptoms. Between 2003 and January 2025, there have been 964 human cases in 24 countries, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2021-dha-docs/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2025.pdf?sfvrsn=e1871d4c_5&amp;amp;download=true"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-humans.html#:~:text=Human%20infections%20with%20avian,mouth%2C%20eyes%20or%20nose."&gt;contract the virus&lt;/a&gt; when in close proximity to infected animals if the virus gets into their eyes, nose, or mouth—most human cases have experienced &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2414610#:~:text=Of%2046%20case,face%20masks%20(47%25)."&gt;conjunctivitis&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting infection via the eyes. Very few of the confirmed human cases have resulted in serious illness. The woman who &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-death-louisiana-82e4d00876e62cb2b13bb621826c84f9"&gt;died in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions. A 13-year-old in Canada with mild asthma and obesity was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890"&gt;hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; after contracting the virus last fall and nearly died, having to be intubated and placed on life support, before recovering sufficiently to be discharged in January. Last week, an elderly Wyoming woman became the &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/"&gt;third American case&lt;/a&gt; requiring hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger lies not in the virus as it is currently transmitted to humans but in potential mutations that could increase the virus’s transmissibility and virulence, threatening an epidemic or pandemic. Historically, human-to-human transmission of the virus has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt;, primarily occurring within households. So far, the transmission has not been efficient enough for sustained spread, and there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission in the current outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the longer the outbreak continues unchecked, particularly among mammals, the greater the risk of mutations that could result in sustained, human-to-human spread. During flu season, researchers are concerned about people and mammals contracting bird flu and other more transmissible types of the flu simultaneously. This creates the potential for viral reassortment, wherein H5N1 could take on some of the genetic features of another, more transmissible strain. This kind of reassortment in combination with the &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/h5n1-detected-in-pig-highlights-the-risk-of-bird-flu-mixing-with-seasonal/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTo%20get%20from,to%20replicate%20best"&gt;right mutations&lt;/a&gt; could result in elevated pandemic risk. The CDC’s guidance &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/vaccination-farm-workers.html#:~:text=While%20a%20seasonal,an%20avian%20virus."&gt;encourages&lt;/a&gt; farm workers to get the seasonal flu vaccine to reduce the chances of dual infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s significant uncertainty,” Bogoch said, “but there are arrows pointing in the direction that this certainly does have epidemic and pandemic potential.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump officials have criticized the previous administration’s response to the outbreak as ineffective and driving up egg prices. “They spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hassett-face-the-nation-transcript-02-16-2025/"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; Sunday. The response until now, while failing to stop the virus’ spread, has followed the USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hpai-response-plan-ppt.pdf"&gt;policy playbook&lt;/a&gt; of culling to contain. Some former public health &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/01/02/bird-flu-biden-trump/"&gt;officials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://features.csis.org/US-bird-flu-response/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; have criticized the Biden administration for responding too slowly. Only in December did the USDA begin &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2024/12/06/usda-announces-new-federal-order-begins-national-milk-testing-strategy-address-h5n1-dairy-herds"&gt;standing up&lt;/a&gt; a national dairy milk testing regime despite &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-undercounts-bird-flu-cattle-farmers-shun-testing-2024-08-15/"&gt;earlier signs&lt;/a&gt; of a lack of testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hassett outlined what appears to be the concept of a plan intended to reduce the number of chickens killed. “What we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn’t have to kill the chickens,” he said. “Have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we’re working on, and we’re finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what would be involved in “biosecurity and medication” or how the administration will approach the human epidemic risk of the virus. The egg industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on improved biosecurity, including investing in truck washing stations, bussing in workers to reduce foot traffic, and lighting systems that discourage waterfowl from landing, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-egg-farmers-biosecurity-backyard-flocks-pandemic-risk/#:~:text=Metz%20said%20the,waterfowl%20from%20landing.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said Emily Metz&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of the American Egg Board. “All the measures we’re doing are still getting beat by this virus,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing and deploying a bird flu vaccine for poultry is one idea that some industry representatives have begun expressing cautious interest in. Last week, the USDA &lt;a href="https://news.zoetis.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Zoetis-Receives-Conditional-License-from-USDA-for-Avian-Influenza-Vaccine-H5N2-Subtype-Killed-Virus/default.aspx"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a conditional license to the pharmaceutical company Zoetis for an update to its vaccine for use in chickens that was initially developed in the early 2000s. The government has &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/01/08/us-department-agriculture-announces-15-additional-states-onboard-national-milk-testing-strategy-h5n1#:~:text=HPAI%20Vaccines%20for,capacity%20for%20vaccine."&gt;maintained a stockpile&lt;/a&gt; of vaccines for use in chickens, but they are not fully updated for the strain of the current outbreak. In the final weeks of the Biden administration, the USDA &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/01/08/us-department-agriculture-announces-15-additional-states-onboard-national-milk-testing-strategy-h5n1"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was moving to update the stockpile but had not made a broader policy shift away from a culling to a vaccination response. But assuming the newer vaccines are effective, some virologists &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/bird-flu-vaccine/index.html#:~:text=Complications%20of%20vaccinations"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; vaccinations aren’t necessarily a silver bullet as they don’t prevent infection and would need to be deployed strategically as one piece of a broader eradication effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/bird-flu-expert-tapped-by-trump-administration-for-pandemic-response-unit"&gt;reportedly tapped&lt;/a&gt; Gerald Parker, a veterinarian and a former senior public health and biosecurity official, to lead the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness. Dr. Ashish Jha, the former White House COVID-19 response coordinator in the Biden administration, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-head-pandemic-office-gerald-parker/#:~:text=%22I%27ve%20not%20been,on%20important%20issues.%22"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; Parker as “a very good choice” and “deeply knowledgeable, serious, not particularly partisan, but really just very focused on important issues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration’s early steps appear to have at least partially hampered the outbreak response. The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-health-communications-cdc-hhs-fda-1eeca64c1ccc324b31b779a86d3999a4"&gt;freeze&lt;/a&gt; on communications from public health agencies, including the CDC and the USDA, left state health officials and researchers working on the virus &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-bird-flu-response-disrupted-early-weeks-trump-administration-sources-say-2025-02-14/"&gt;confused&lt;/a&gt; and isolated as meetings were canceled and regular reports on the course of the outbreak withheld. The USDA also admitted Tuesday that it &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/usda-accidentally-fired-officials-bird-flu-rehire-rcna192716"&gt;accidentally fired&lt;/a&gt; employees working on the virus response that they’re now trying to rehire, and a &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/trump-administration-firings-bird-flu-response-00204542"&gt;quarter of the staff&lt;/a&gt; in the USDA’s National Animal Health Laboratory Network’s program office has been let go. The office manages data and coordination across the labs doing animal testing including those working on the bird flu—labs were &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/trump-administration-firings-bird-flu-response-00204542#:~:text=The%20labs%20that%20make%20up%20the%20American%20Association%20of%20Veterinary%20Laboratory%20Diagnosticians%20were%20informed%20that%20testing%20and%20other%20responses%20to%20the%20H5N1%20outbreak%20would%20be%20slower%20after%20the%20layoff%2C%20said%20Keith%20Poulsen%2C%20director%20of%20the%20Wisconsin%20Veterinary%20Diagnostic%20Laboratory."&gt;notified Friday&lt;/a&gt; that H5N1 testing would be slower following the firings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s no way to confidently predict whether the bird flu will become a serious threat to humans, more scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/health/bird-flu-h5n1.html"&gt;grown concerned&lt;/a&gt; with how long the outbreak has dragged on. “Some people might say, ‘Well, you know what, if we’re going to have an epidemic or a pandemic wouldn’t we have seen it by now?” Bogoch told &lt;strong&gt;TMD&lt;/strong&gt;. “And the answer is, maybe, maybe not, but, the costs of being wrong are pretty catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-worth-your-time"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth Your Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a stunning &lt;a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/we-live-like-royalty-and-dont-know-it"&gt;portrait of human progress&lt;/a&gt;, Charles C. Mann compared the lives of average middle-class Americans today to those of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century elites. Take Thomas Jefferson, for example: “Jefferson lived in a world of horse-drawn carriages, blazing fireplaces, and yellow fever. But what most separates our day from his is not our automobiles, airplanes, and high-rise apartments — it is that today vast systems provide abundant food, water, energy, and health to most people. … In Jefferson’s time, not even the president of the United States had what we have,” Mann wrote in the &lt;em&gt;New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;. “Jefferson believed that an informed citizenry was necessary to democratic self-rule — a mandate that extends all the way out to understanding the systems that envelop us. It’s easy to see why he believed this: Voters who understand how we are entwined with these systems will support maintaining and expanding them for our children and grandchildren. … Water, food, energy, public health — these embody a gloriously egalitarian and democratic vision of our society. Americans may fight over red and blue, but everyone benefits in the same way from the electric grid. Water troubles and food contamination are afflictions for rich and poor alike. These systems are powerful reminders of our common purpose as a society — a source of inspiration when one seems badly needed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) will be administered to over 591 000 children under 10 years of age to protect them from polio. This campaign follows the recent detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in Gaza, signaling ongoing circulation in the environment, putting children at risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pockets of individuals with low or no immunity provide the virus an opportunity to continue spreading and potentially cause disease. The current environment in Gaza, including overcrowding in shelters and severely damaged water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, which facilitates fecal-oral transmission, create ideal conditions for further spread of poliovirus. Extensive population movement consequent to the current ceasefire is likely to exacerbate the spread of poliovirus infection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two previous vaccination rounds in the Gaza Strip were successfully conducted in September and October 2024, reaching over 95% of the target. As poliovirus is found to remain in the environment, additional vaccination efforts are needed to reach every child and strengthen population immunity. The presence of the virus still poses a risk to children with low or no immunity, in Gaza and throughout the region.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, health workers faced significant challenges accessing certain areas of central, north and south Gaza, which required special coordination to enter during the conflict. In inaccessible areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, where humanitarian pauses for the vaccination campaign were not assured, approximately 7 000 children missed vaccination during the second round. The recent ceasefire means health workers have considerably better access now.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No additional polio cases have been reported since a ten-month-old child was paralyzed in August 2024, but the new environmental samples from Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, collected in December 2024 and January 2025, confirm poliovirus transmission. The strain detected is genetically linked to the poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip in July 2024. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming vaccination campaign aims to reach all children under 10 years of age, including those previously missed, to close immunity gaps and end the outbreak. The use of the oral polio vaccine will help end this outbreak by preventing the spread of the virus. An additional polio vaccination round is planned to be implemented in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The campaign will be led by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other partners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polio vaccines are safe and there is no maximum number of times a child should be vaccinated. Each dose gives additional protection which is needed during an active polio outbreak.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO, UNICEF, and partners welcome the recent ceasefire and urge for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term peace.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. has said he wants to build an “off-ramp” from the country’s reliance on insecticides and herbicides to grow food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The chemicals pollute our bodies the same way that they pollute the soil,” Mr. Kennedy &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUqUcbs7yb8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. This week, Mr. Kennedy, now the federal health secretary, said that a commission established by President Trump to examine chronic disease rates would look into the use of pesticides, as well as childhood vaccines, microplastics and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy’s opposition to herbicides, particularly a widely used chemical called glyphosate, has earned support from some environmental advocates, so-called “MAHA moms” and wellness influencers. But some of the claims he and others have made about glyphosate — including that it is potentially linked to cancer, gluten allergies and a variety of other health issues — are based on science that is still not settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Prominent organizations have come to markedly different judgments on glyphosate after reviewing the research. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;classified glyphosate&lt;/a&gt; as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Two years later, the Environmental Protection Agency &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/epa-releases-draft-risk-assessments-glyphosate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;concluded that glyphosate&lt;/a&gt; was “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans” and that it posed “no other meaningful risks to human health when the product is used according to the pesticide label.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So should you be trying to avoid it? Here’s what the science shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-143dbf2f"&gt;How is glyphosate used?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Glyphosate, first sold by Monsanto in 1974 under the brand name Roundup, kills weeds by inhibiting an enzyme that is essential for plant growth. It became the most used weedkiller nationwide after Monsanto introduced genetically modified crops that were resistant to glyphosate’s effects, said Marty Williams, an ecologist with the United States Department of Agriculture’s research service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/toxic-herbicides-map-showing-high-use-state-rcna50052#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Nearly half&lt;/a&gt; of all planted acres of corn and soybeans in the United States are treated with glyphosate-based herbicides, as are some crops like tree nuts and grapes.

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a TikTok trend, everyone. Naturally, though, TikTok has picked it up and sent the #saltwater trend skyrocketing. People have been adding salt to their water for decades, and there are reported benefits, like boosting hydration and restoring lost minerals in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I exercise roughly five times a week, enjoying activities like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/what-to-wear-for-hot-yoga" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/what-to-wear-for-hot-yoga"&gt;hot yoga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/9-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-crossfit-beginner" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/9-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-crossfit-beginner"&gt;CrossFit&lt;/a&gt;, which means I sweat — a lot. Sweating can cause dehydration if those lost electrolytes aren’t replenished, and I’ve heard that adding a pinch of salt to your tap water could do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious, I did some digging into the existing research. I also spoke with two registered nutritionists to see if there’s anything to the salt water trend and what the potential health benefits include. Here’s what has happened so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-salt-water-trend"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the salt water trend?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, it involves adding a pinch of salt to your water to promote water absorption and prevent dehydration, similar to how electrolyte tablets or drinks work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adding salt to water, a practice often referred to as “electrolyte water” is becoming increasingly popular,” says Elena Rolt, a registered nutritional therapist and certified functional medicine practitioner at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.healthmiro.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="http://www.healthmiro.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Health Miro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@autumn_bates_/video/7228734496248450347" data-video-id="7228734496248450347"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Salt helps with rehydration and maintaining electrolyte balance,” Rolt explains. “Salt contains two key electrolyte minerals — sodium and chloride — that aid in fluid retention by the cells rather than being rapidly excreted by the body. This can be especially beneficial after sweating, whether from exercise, sauna, or illness, as it helps replenish lost electrolytes and prevent dehydration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Rolt, sodium and chloride are the most abundant electrolytes in the body, helping to maintain fluid balance, regulate blood pressure and aid in nerve signaling. Drinking water with a pinch of salt could even reduce muscle cramps, especially after intense physical activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chloride found in salt may stimulate the production of hydrochloric acid, promoting better digestion and nutrient absorption,” Rolt adds. “Some people also report an energy boost from electrolyte water, as the sodium helps regulate blood pressure, nerve and muscle function, reducing fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love boosting energy and hydration levels with an electrolyte tablet or drink, especially before a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-hyrox-beginner" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/3-things-i-wish-i-had-known-as-a-hyrox-beginner"&gt;Hyrox competition&lt;/a&gt; or intense CrossFit class. After hot yoga, I can be immediately found guzzling cold water as I recover from the heat. I also see many runners, especially long-distance ones, topping up with isotonic gels and drinks. Could I save a whole lot of money by adding a pinch of salt to my water instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened and what I learned when I tried it for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-the-type-of-salt-you-use-matters-as-well-as-how-much-and-how-often-you-use-it"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. The type of salt you use matters, as well as how much and how often you use it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grabbed one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-water-bottles" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-water-bottles"&gt;best water bottles&lt;/a&gt;, opened my laptop, and got to work learning what salt I should use, how much and how often. After all, I’ve had it drummed into me that I should&lt;em&gt; limit&lt;/em&gt; the amount of salt I put into my body. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7384997" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7384997" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; consistently shows excessive sodium consumption is linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolt tells me: “When it comes to how much salt to add, it is best to start with a small amount…a small pinch of salt or around ¼ of a teaspoon per one liter of water.” That’s really to assess how your body reacts; then, you can adjust to suit your preference. Interestingly, Rolt says you shouldn’t be able to taste it. If you can, you’re probably using too much. Noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the type of salt, Rolt advises unrefined sea salt like Maldon salt or Himalayan pink salt, as these contain a “wider range” of electrolytes like magnesium, calcium and potassium, plus trace minerals like manganese, selenium, zinc and copper. Refined table salt only contains sodium and chloride, lacking other minerals lost during the refining process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for how often, Rolt says adding unrefined salt to your water should be done “strategically,” such as after intense physical activity, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-boosted-my-exercise-recovery-with-heat-and-cold-therapy-heres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-boosted-my-exercise-recovery-with-heat-and-cold-therapy-heres-what-happened"&gt;sauna sessions&lt;/a&gt;, time spent in hot climates, or periods of illness. While she doesn’t mention alcohol intake, it could also help replenish lost fluids during a nasty hangover (I’ve&lt;em&gt; definitely&lt;/em&gt; turned to an electrolyte drink with a sore head on more than one occasion!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-i-peed-less-yes-really"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. I peed less (yes, really)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drink a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of water and find myself peeing often. I’ve been told by my doctor (on several occasions) that I might not be absorbing fluids properly, given that I’m also thirsty even after a drink. Plus, I’m neither diabetic nor pre-diabetic — and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/diabetes-symptoms/art-20044248" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/diabetes-symptoms/art-20044248" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;increased thirst can be a symptom&lt;/a&gt; of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of monitoring my trips to the toilet and how I felt each day, I noticed I needed to pee less often, which surprised me. To be honest, I wasn’t expecting to feel any different. Could I really be retaining water better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jennie Norton, registered dietician nutritionist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://veganwins.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://veganwins.co.uk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Vegan Wins&lt;/a&gt;, says adding salt to water every day isn’t always necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people get plenty of sodium from food, and drinking salted water when you don’t need it won’t do you any favors,” she warns. “Too much sodium over time is linked to high blood pressure and heart issues, and in the short term, it can cause bloating and fluid retention. If you overdo it, it can even make dehydration worse by pulling water out of your cells instead of helping you retain it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Norton recommends adding a little salt to water if you’re losing electrolytes in specific situations, like recovering from a stomach bug or periods of dehydration, but not every day. “It might be better to focus on water-rich foods or plain filtered water for hydration,” she adds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given this is just an experiment, I’ll probably limit adding salt to water to exercise-heavy days or when I’m feeling a little dehydrated. Or hungover, let's face it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolt says adding unrefined salt to your water should be done “strategically.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-i-learned-more-about-the-risks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. I learned more about the risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a qualified coach, I know that excessive salt intake isn’t good for your diet or health (no more than 6g per day), but I wanted to know if adding a pinch of salt to my water regularly (given I already felt it had been helping me retain water) could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your diet already contains a lot of salt…adding more to your water is not advisable,” Norton tells me. “Individuals with high blood pressure, kidney issues, or heart disease should consult a healthcare professional before incorporating any salt.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve learned the general consensus is that drinking enough water — the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/newsroom/ourviews/keeping-hydrated" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.bupa.co.uk/newsroom/ourviews/keeping-hydrated" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;daily recommended intake&lt;/a&gt; is roughly 2-2.5 liters or 8 glasses — should be enough to keep you functioning. Plus, eating a diet rich in whole foods, fruits, veggies and whole grains that contain potassium and magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve been sweating a lot or recovering from an illness, something like coconut water or a simple homemade electrolyte drink with a little citrus and a tiny pinch of salt can help replenish what you’ve lost,” adds Norton. If you struggle to retain fluids, checking with a medical professional for a wider health concern could also be useful to rule out any underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-is-it-good-to-add-salt-to-your-water"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is it good to add salt to your water?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty on top of my diet. I cook from scratch on most days, eat plenty of fruit and veggies and ensure my water bottle is regularly topped up and by my side. Given that I’m not diabetic but still struggle to retain fluids, I’ll be adding a pinch of salt to my water here and there, and I believe it's helping me feel more hydrated and less thirsty day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I plan to prioritize a pinch of salt on days when I know I’ll be hitting the gym hard rather than making it a daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this experiment, I found it interesting that you can provide the body with necessary minerals (electrolytes like sodium, magnesium and potassium) to retain and absorb the water you drink throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without them, you might drink enough fluids but without retaining the nutrients you need. That doesn't mean you need to add salt to your water every day, but a little could help if you don't sit in a higher-risk health category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for other ways to boost hydration?

In an article for Alzheimer's Research UK, Dr. Rittman conveyed the complexity of diagnosing dementia in its nascent phases and how it can easily be mistaken for other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged the common uncertainty faced when changes are noticed in someone you know, "And that means it can be hard to know how much to worry if you think someone might be a bit different than when you last saw them. That's understandable – it's something many of us know very little about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a YouGov survey revealed a gap in public awareness, with less than half of those surveyed (49%) capable of identifying "memory loss" as a consequence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mere 12% of the 2,162 respondents were aware that the disease leads to a loss of independence, while a significant portion (22%) confessed to having no clue about the repercussions of living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a surprising finding, given how dementia will impact so many of us", Dr Rittman expressed. "It is important, then, to raise awareness of early signs of dementia so people with symptoms can be referred to a memory clinic for a full assessment and an accurate, timely diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An early diagnosis means that people with dementia and their loved ones can plan for the future, access the right care and support, and consider the option of taking part in research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rittman then highlighted some of the key symptoms to be aware of. He stated, "When it first starts, dementia's signs and symptoms are often mild and not that easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mild forgetfulness, changes to perception or the way we speak can be early indications that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Miss:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/163145/donald-trumps-words-super-bowl"&gt;Donald Trump's telling words at the Super Bowl exposed by lip reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/163166/dementia-signs-alzheimers-warning-fridge-kitchen"&gt;Dementia experts highlight unusual kitchen habit as early warning sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/161023/five-early-signs-dementia-including-one-shows-bed-night" target="_blank"&gt;Five early signs of dementia - including one that shows in bed at night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really important to know that these kinds of symptoms can have other causes, such as low mood, or the side-effects of medications. But they could be early signs of dementia," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rittman, issues with memory and thinking are symptoms of dementia that might become noticeable when someone is watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He elaborated, "Early on, forgetfulness could be mild, affecting memory for places or things that have happened in the past. You may notice someone asking the same question in quick succession or struggling to remember the names of objects around the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People may find they struggle to concentrate on daily tasks, or they may find following the storyline of a TV program difficult for example."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 08:23:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS0hlR2dwc2VnQnVJQlI4cGFqVlltRlNGS3VmWmdERW1Wb0lTTndObWxxNnZjZzVINWhTb3JQWUVuVm0tWl9rSDdLZ3pJcnB2V3F3bzIxMTQzUjJxQ1hYRlE3WjZpRGd3R3RVNEphejdsYXJBMVhjNUo1X1lqNm5pMGYtbkUyLWtMaDk1U1dkMVJIMFNDQ25hUEI1c2V5Y3NU0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5iYUlvWmtJckRSNmZJdnFYUWx2S1U3RGxjeXFYb19sVHRMU1lCN2Fldl9zRmVHcXRZZWxpbm9rTDFVLWFNQVk1XzJyLXZfNHZsQXRUTjRXWDQzcFdYOVlzTl91YllsN00tZmUwNXgzbFNkT3BtVEF1RVcxOHRrMFVvN0V2RVRvYVp3NFhIZGNMZ2pDdTlNdUJGMnMxbXlUMEdXZDk3SGc</guid></item><item><title>Want To Prevent Dementia?

He added that one of the most common kinds of cognitive decline in older people is “vascular cognitive impairment, which is a direct result of compromised circulation in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg said simple, small positive habits, like diet and exercise, can often bring the biggest health rewards.

Additionally, if you smoke, you should talk to your doctor about quitting, to protect both your brain and your overall health, Garg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to manage your emotions, and you can talk to your doctor about how to best do that, too. “There are so many different ways to curb anxiety and stress, but people don’t realize how much of an impact it can make on your body and your brain,” Garg said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355582/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67aa6992e4b0ade4a9a37bfa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355582/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that anxiety is linked to higher rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Exercise benefits your brain health and your heart health.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are questions you should bring up throughout your life, not just once you reach a certain age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s never too late to think more holistically about your brain health, you should always pay attention to them — not just once you reach old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison said these questions focus “on prevention throughout the life cycle, not just in the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cognitive decline is often only associated with getting older, problems during mid-life, such as sleep disorders and unmanaged high blood pressure, can compound your risks for cognitive decline and dementia later on, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to talk to your doctor about any cognitive changes you notice, no matter your age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you go see a doctor sooner than later, then we can find things that are reversible to prevent further decline. But when you’re afraid or you’re not sure if it’s the right thing to do, then we may get to the point where you’re not able to fix things,” Garg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg always reminds her patients that it’s OK to ask your doctor questions, whether you think they’re the “right” ones or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison added that not all cognitive changes are related to major health issues, either. Stress, anxiety, certain medications and certain health conditions can cause cognitive issues, too, making it crucial to talk to your primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your doctor can also help you incorporate exercise, social connections, a nutritious diet and other healthy lifestyle habits into your life — because there’s real proof that these good habits work, Ellison said. &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/dementia-rates-falling-13-decade/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The rate of dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67aa6992e4b0ade4a9a37bfa" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/dementia-rates-falling-13-decade/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;The rate of dementia&lt;/a&gt; in older adults is decreasing.
