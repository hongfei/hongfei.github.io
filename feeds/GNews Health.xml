A quarter of the CDC has now been cut by multiple rounds of layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1a988aa5-7f8a-4ea5-8130-5c256b108904" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"New York declares state of emergency to issue food banks $65m amid shutdown","elementId":"1a988aa5-7f8a-4ea5-8130-5c256b108904","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/new-york-food-banks-emergency-shutdown"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some employees who had to work without pay through the shutdown received RIF notices; others who were furloughed learned they would never return to their jobs. Employees who were supposed to be protected from RIFs by an ongoing lawsuit received them anyway. The human resources department at CDC was brought back from unpaid furlough in order to process about 1,300 layoffs – and then their own, as the entire HR department was eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of the gutted departments are required by law to continue their work, despite having no employees. The ethics office and the institutional review board (IRB) were also ended, which means the CDC will no longer have oversight on ethical violations and research protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The entire library staff at the CDC, an integral part of research and recommendations, was terminated. The Washington office, which developed policy briefings and provided information to Congress members, was eliminated as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Promotion, the national health and nutrition examination survey, and the staff focused on suicide prevention also suffered layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The multiple cuts across the agency mean the CDC is not able to carry out much of its work, even as some employees remain, said Karen Remley, who previously ran the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and was a state health official in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In April, for instance, the entire team behind the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Prams) was cut, which means a critical tool for understanding maternal and child health is now missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You can’t take out Prams and keep the registry and have all that work happen,” Remley said. “This artificial separating and splitting really means the work on the local level stops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, CDC employees have endured attacks and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On 8 August, a gunman fired 500 rounds of ammunition at the CDC headquarters, killing David Rose, an officer, and traumatizing agency employees and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health agency employees have been doxed, with their identities and personal information revealed. Matthew Buckham, Kennedy’s acting chief of staff, was co-founder of the group that maintains a “DEI Watch List” targeting HHS employees. The agency has also been roiled by high-profile &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/rfk-jr-senate-hearing-cdc-susan-monarez" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;departures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“At the highest level of leadership in the CDC, there are no public health or medical professionals left to help guide CDC recommendations,” said Abigail Tighe, a former CDC employee and founding member of the National Public Health Coalition, which held a recent press conference where Backus and other former CDC employees spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Billions in contracts and direct funding to state and local public health agencies has been canceled or clawed back, and the American people are cued up to suffer. It is hard to succinctly put into words what the decimation of the CDC means for everyday Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first round of layoffs at CDC came on Valentine’s day. Probationary employees – who were in the first year or two of their jobs, either because they had been recently hired or had moved to new positions – along with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/20/trump-fired-health-employees" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;established senior employees&lt;/a&gt; received notices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A judge &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.444883/gov.uscourts.cand.444883.261.0.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; in September that the probationary terminations went too far and some of the employees were reinstated and placed on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, RIF notices went out on 1 April, eliminating entire offices such as the office on smoking and health, where Backus worked. She didn’t even receive the notice at first because her access to the CDC network, including email, had been cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lawsuit specifically prevents employees like Backus from being reorganized into new offices or terminated from the agency, she said. That’s why she thought she would be safe this time – but she still received a third layoff notice. That notice was rescinded after less than 24 hours. About 700 employees were reinstated, while 600 &lt;a href="http://theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/cdc-job-cuts-partial-reversal" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;remain terminated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I still remain on administrative leave, unable to do my job,” Backus said. “My situation just highlights the chaos and confusion that federal employees have experienced over the past year. I’m stuck in limbo, following court cases, gathering information, and trying to figure out what my next steps should be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Charlotte Kent, former editor-in-chief of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), said: “We have so many people who, if they’ve been [un-RIFed], have been on administrative leave. We have the inefficiency of so many government resources, our taxpayer dollars, going to fight the illegal activities that have been done by the administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The MMWR was among the departments completely gutted and then reinstated – which was particularly surprising, because the highly regarded scientific journal was specifically included in the president’s budget request for the first time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“To have it cut at this point is just shocking,” Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s like being in a strange game where there’s no rules,” said one former CDC employee who was RIFed on 10 October and spoke anonymously to avoid reprisal from the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s honestly like Squid Games – we don’t know what’s going to happen next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Brooks, who retired last year from the CDC after 26 years and served as the chief medical officer for several emergency responses, said the RIFs demonstrated a “stunning level of incompetency”. Firing the CDC Washington staff means “Congress no longer has a means of direct access to the agency it funds when it needs information or briefings”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-live-updates-as-military-poised-to-miss-first-paychecks-next-week/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; says about 700 of the terminations were a coding error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is clear to us that this was not a coding error,” said Tighe. “This RIF was carried out just as all the other ones have been, where they fire as many people as they think they can get away with, there’s public outcry, there’s outcry from congressional members and then they bring back the things that they think people cannot get over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She called the firings “an intentional attack on the American people and the public’s health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our country is on an uncertain and frankly frightening path,” Tighe said. “We would love to see Congress step in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNejJUUTZISC1UOUtOdlVMOU5jczR0eHloTXZ6RFlpdjFnWVJMUjZ6aExyQURPNXNFeHFlVXVTaHFldGY2UkxHc0FBNnk4S1BIQUFDc2diSmJMMGd1c3YzaGpPd1EzREVEZmRxQmN4RjU3d3RmTXpaVzdJVVpZWVMzQi1BZ2taSE83</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州医生转诊的病人因踝关节手术、过夜住院而被$ 64,000的账单绊倒-《丹佛邮报》</title><link>https://www.denverpost.com/2025/10/31/surprise-medical-bill-colorado/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Julie Appleby,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physician Lauren Hughes was heading to see patients at a clinic about 20 miles from her Denver home in February when another driver T-boned her Subaru, totaling it. She was taken by ambulance to the closest hospital, &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/intermountain-health-platte-valley-hospital"&gt;Platte Valley Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Brighton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shaken Hughes was examined in the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with bruising, a deep cut on her knee, and a broken ankle. Physicians recommended immediate surgical repair, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said: ‘You have this fracture and a big gaping wound in your knee. We need to take you to the OR to wash it out and make sure there’s no infection,’” she said. “As a clinician, I thought, ‘Yes.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-smyizmlx" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_smyizmlx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was taken to the operating room in the early evening, then admitted to the hospital overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend took her home the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the bills came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Medical Procedure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgeons cleaned the cut on her right knee, which had hit her car’s dashboard, and realigned a broken bone in her right ankle, stabilizing it with metal screws. Surgery is typically recommended when a broken bone is deemed unlikely to heal properly with only a cast.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;h4&gt;The Final Bill&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$63,976.35, charged by the hospital — which was not in-network with the insurance plan she got through her job — for the surgery and overnight stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Problem: Should I Stay or Should I Go?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hughes’ insurer, Anthem, fully covered the nearly $2,400 ambulance ride and some smaller radiology charges from the ER, but denied the surgery and overnight stay charges from the out-of-network hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sixty-three thousand dollars for a broken ankle and a cut to the knee, with no head injury or internal damage,” Hughes said. “Just to stay there overnight. It’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers have broad power to determine &lt;a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/consumer-health-insurance-what-is-medical-necessity.pdf"&gt;whether care is medically necessary&lt;/a&gt; — that is, what is needed for treatment, diagnosis, or relief. And that decision affects whether and how much they will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Four days after her surgery, Anthem notified Hughes that after consulting clinical guidelines for her type of ankle repair, its reviewer determined it was not medically necessary for her to be fully admitted for an inpatient hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she had needed additional surgery or had other problems, such as vomiting or a fever, an inpatient stay might have been warranted, according to the letter. “The information we have does not show you have these or other severe problems,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Hughes, the notion that she should have left the hospital was “ludicrous.” Her car was in a junkyard, she had no family nearby, and she was taking opioid painkillers for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she asked for further details about medical necessity determinations, Hughes was directed deep inside her policy’s benefit booklet, which outlines that, for a hospital stay, documentation must show “safe and adequate care could not be obtained as an outpatient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the surgery charges were denied because of an insurance contract quirk. Under Anthem’s agreement with the hospital, all claims for services before and after a patient is admitted are approved or denied together, said Anthem spokesperson Emily Snooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hospital stay is not generally required after ankle surgery, and the insurer found Hughes did not need the kind of “comprehensive, complex medical care” that would necessitate hospitalization, Snooks wrote in an email to KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anthem has consistently agreed that Ms. Hughes’ ankle surgery was medically necessary,” Snooks wrote. “However, because the ankle surgery was bundled with the inpatient admission, the entire claim was denied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing bills from an out-of-network hospital where she was taken by emergency responders, though, Hughes did not understand why she wasn’t shielded by the &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/no-surprises-understand-your-rights-against-surprise-medical-bills"&gt;No Surprises Act&lt;/a&gt;, which took effect in 2022. The federal law requires insurers to cover out-of-network providers as though they are in-network when patients receive emergency care, among other protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they had determined it was medically necessary, then they would have to apply the No Surprises Act cost,” said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at Brookings. “But the No Surprises Act is not going to override the normal medical necessity determination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one more oddity in her case. During one of many calls Hughes made trying to sort out her bill, an Anthem representative told her that things might have been different had the hospital billed for her hospitalization as an overnight “observation” stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, that’s when patients are kept at a facility so staff can determine whether they need to be admitted. Rather than being tied to the stay’s duration, the designation mainly reflects the intensity of care. A patient with fewer needs is more likely to be billed for an observation stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers pay hospitals less for an observation stay than admission, Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That distinction is a big issue for patients on Medicare. Most often, the government health program will not pay for &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/skilled-nursing-facility-care#:~:text=You%20may%20not,for%20more%20information."&gt;any care needed in a nursing home&lt;/a&gt; if the patient was not first formally admitted to a &lt;a href="https://www.appliedpolicy.com/11-years-of-the-two-midnight-rule-how-a-controversial-policy-is-shaping-medicare-and-hospital-admissions-in-2024/#:~:text=The%20length%20of,patient%E2%80%99s%20financial%20responsibility."&gt;hospital for at least three days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a classic battle between providers and insurers as to what bucket a claim falls in,” Fiedler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Resolution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a physician and a &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/farleyhealthpolicycenter/who-we-are/farley-center-staff/lauren-hughes"&gt;director of a health policy center at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus&lt;/a&gt;, Hughes is a savvier-than-usual policyholder. Yet even she was frustrated during the months spent going back and forth with her insurer and the hospital — and worried when it looked like her account would be sent to a collection agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to appealing the denied claims, she sought the help of her employer’s human resources department, which contacted Anthem. She also &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/send-us-your-medical-bills/"&gt;reached out to KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;, which contacted Anthem and the Platte Valley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late September, Hughes received calls from a hospital official, who told her they had “downgraded the level of care” the hospital billed her insurance for and resubmitted the claim to Anthem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written statement to KFF Health News, Platte Valley Hospital spokesperson Sara Quale said that the facility “deeply regrets any anxiety this situation has caused her.” The hospital had “prematurely” and erroneously sent Hughes a bill before working out the balance with Anthem, she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a careful review of Ms. Hughes’ situation,” Quale continued, “we have now stopped all billing to her. Furthermore, we have informed Ms. Hughes that if her insurance company ultimately assigns the remaining balance to her, she will not be billed for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthem spokesperson Stephanie DuBois said in an email that Platte Valley resubmitted Hughes’ bill to the insurer on Oct. 3, this time for “outpatient care services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explanation of benefits that was sent to Hughes shows the hospital rebilled for around $61,000 — about $40,000 of which was knocked off the total by an Anthem discount. The insurer paid the hospital nearly $21,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Hughes owed only a $250 copayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are places where patients receiving emergency care at an out-of-network hospital may fall through the cracks of federal billing protections, in particular during a phase that may be nearly indistinguishable to the patient, known as “post-stabilization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, that occurs when the medical provider determines the patient is &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;stable enough to travel&lt;/a&gt; to an in-network facility using nonmedical transport, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the patient prefers to stay put for further treatment, the out-of-network provider must then ask the patient &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/know-your-rights/using-insurance#notice-and-consent-poststabilization"&gt;to sign a consent form&lt;/a&gt;, agreeing to waive billing protections and continue treatment at out-of-network rates, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important that if they give you some kind of letter to sign that you read that letter very carefully, because that letter might give them your permission to get some big bills,” Hoadley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, patients should contact their insurer, in addition to asking the hospital’s billing department: Are you being fully admitted, or kept under observation status, and why? Has your care been determined to be medically necessary? Keep in mind that medical necessity determinations play a key role in whether coverage is approved or denied, even after services are provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Hughes did not recall being told she was stable enough to leave with nonmedical transportation, nor being asked to sign a consent form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her advice is to quickly and aggressively question insurance denials once they are received, including by asking for your case to be escalated to the insurer’s and hospital’s leadership. She said expecting patients to navigate complicated billing questions while in the hospital after a serious injury isn’t realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was calling family,” Hughes said, “alerting my work colleagues about what happened, processing the extent of my injuries and what needed to be done clinically, arranging care for my pet, getting labs and imaging done — coming to grips with what just happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

If it rises significantly, surgery and/or radiation are more aggressive treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UU5SG7KGFZAR5CFJ4ADJJU5LMU"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more of Roy’s ‘&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.al.com/topic/cancer%20chronicles/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.al.com/topic/cancer%20chronicles/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3N3FPPSUJFE2NK6NHAH2VACUEQ"&gt;My PSA score in July was 4-almost-5, a spike from prior annual tests, which prompted my primary care physician to send me to a urologist.

I’ve long held onto Isaiah 40:31 as one of my go-to scriptures, knowing that &lt;i&gt;those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength&lt;/i&gt;. It became my mantra as my wife and I navigated the waves of treatment options, including surgery and/or radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K6AN4O7TEJHFBHW7TGIPRM445Y"&gt;My cancer was deemed stage 2, a slow-moving cancer confirmed by a genetic test. And because I caught it early, thanks to regular PSA testing at annual checkups, active surveillance was a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ROPDRLCLXRH4VG4VRFRF2DQAXY"&gt;And it’s the one we chose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XV4J4QFJVZG2FJBEHUTFIWW4FU"&gt;I am not alone, surprisingly. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/well/live/prostate-cancer-treatment-explainer.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;The New York Times published an overview of prostate cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; and I learned that “today &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22335873/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;nearly 60 percent of patients&lt;/a&gt; with low-risk cancers choose active monitoring instead of treatment — up from 26 percent in 2014. Some experts believe that number should be higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ALJHAIVNFVEL5PJOISPJNYAK5A"&gt;I am &lt;i&gt;far &lt;/i&gt;from alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4WBFLBILFVBUPNX7OKTXMSQHFY"&gt;So, yes, I am waiting because I know &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012%3A9&amp;amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;His power is made perfect in our weakness&lt;/a&gt;. And cancer is a profound weakness that, even as treatments of almost all forms of the disease have drastically improved in my near-70 years of life, kills far too many. Far too many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ABKLHLKDEFCQBMSFCJ5DEYJEIQ"&gt;My treatment, however, isn’t called waiting.

People who are sharing their own personal cancer journeys with me. I find myself praying for as many as are praying for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E7DWV47KV5DVRADRHD4USODYTY"&gt;That’s why I consider myself a cancer survivor. I know the term. It’s generally meant for those who’ve rung the bell.

To be clear: I may still have cancer in my body. My next PSA test isn’t scheduled for a long while, but I am fully confident in this — I am a survivor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OGY5VQB5XVBTLFHBYHQXFVKTSE"&gt;I survived anxiety.

I joined the board of directors of the&lt;a href="https://mikeslivefoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Mike Slive Foundation for Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;, which provides early-stage grants for potentially groundbreaking efforts to cure for prostate cancer, and host free PSA testing at various events across Alabama and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5BY2KYGKONDF5IZVAXQNTOCOAY"&gt;I am also an ambassador for&lt;a href="https://nowincluded.com/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; NowIncluded&lt;/a&gt;, an online community where people in underrepresented communities are heard and supported throughout their health journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GCDVMF2JDJD5TMI62V6QIOWB3A"&gt;Both entities are committed to saving lives.

She smiled. “We call that thriving,” she said, “thriving with cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35" data-gaid="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6ZG2K5T4ANA73GJ3N6CGOJDXNY"&gt;It’s been long proven that a positive attitude can impact health outcomes.

Viewers are finding them enlightening and comforting as many people  — mainly women — are undiagnosed as they reach adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://neurodivergentinsights.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Megan Anna Neff;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Megan Anna Neff&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Oregon, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35204992/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a recent study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that 80% of women with autism are still undiagnosed at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many reasons for this: For starters, people learn to adjust their behavior to fit in with society. Additionally,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the autism diagnostic tools used today were developed exclusively on white boys from high socioeconomic status, said &lt;a href="https://www.stephaniegardnerwright.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephanie Gardner-Wright;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stephanie Gardner-Wright&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed master social worker and certified autism clinical specialist in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is also a huge focus on the external signs and not so much the internal symptoms of autism, Gardner-Wright said. And those internal symptoms are very different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are so many ways that autism can show up and present,” Neff added. “I think there’s more diversity within autism than there is between autism and allistic.” (Allistic people are folks who aren’t on the autism spectrum.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, there are a number of signs or thought patterns that undiagnosed autistic people may be able to relate to. HuffPost spoke with mental health professionals, including some people who are neurodivergent themselves, about the signs of autism in adulthood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Feeling Of Being ‘Different’ From Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Pixelcatchers / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/laurengarafano/doctors-share-little-things-people-ignore?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors Are Sharing The 16 &amp;quot;Tiny&amp;quot; Health Things That Most People Ignore But 100% Shouldn't;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors Are Sharing The 16 "Tiny" Health Things That Most People Ignore But 100% Shouldn't&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All four experts shared that it’s common for autistic people to feel different. &lt;a href="https://effectiveartistry.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brandon Tessers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Brandon Tessers&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Effective Artistry, a therapy group that supports neurodivergent people, said some folks will describe it as “feeling like an alien sometimes,” while &lt;a href="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Vanessa Bal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Vanessa Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Adult Autism Services Psychological Services Clinic at Rutgers University in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/carolinekee/what-is-adenovirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; said folks describe it as “a lifetime experience of feeling different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The difference between this feeling and the occasional outsider feeling everyone deals with from time to time is that for autistic folks, this feeling does not come and go and is not only during one specific period, like middle school, Bal told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that this is a big indicator and an internal experience at that — you cannot look at a person and know if they feel like an outsider. The feeling could be overpowering or could be more subtle, it depends on the person, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But, it’s important to know that autistic people don’t necessarily feel like outsiders all the time, Bal noted. They may find settings that are more inclusive for neurodivergent people. Additionally, some adults also say they feel more comfortable with who they are and worry less about differences, sometimes seeing them as strengths, as they get older, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty With Social Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Oliver Rossi / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Social cues are also another sign. Someone with undiagnosed autism may find they have trouble deciphering how much eye contact is appropriate or when they should stop smiling during a conversation, Gardner-Wright said. They may be able to mask these uncertainties by learning how much is appropriate, but it’s not an innate sense as it is with someone who is allistic, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Confusing Relationship History — Both Romantically Or Platonically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Peopleimages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Neff, many undiagnosed autistic adults have a confusing and complicated social relationship history. Additionally, romantic relationships may feel tough to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There might be relationships that have that kind of suddenly burst apart but the autistic person doesn’t understand why,” she said. When it comes to the reason behind this complicated relationship history, it’s likely that the person with autism doesn’t know why their relationships fail when other people’s don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/scarymouse/doctors-sharing-mild-symptoms-actually-serious-medical-3?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"Get To The Doctor Right Now" — People Are Revealing 24 "Mild" Medical Symptoms That Can Actually Be A Sign Of A Major, Major Issue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;"Get To The Doctor Right Now" — People Are Revealing 24 "Mild" Medical Symptoms That Can Actually Be A Sign Of A Major, Major Issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Simpleimages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sensitivity to sensory input — like noise and sight — is another potential sign of autism, said Gardner-Wright, who added that this can mean being hyper-aware of a sound or totally unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who are not autistic tend to be more or less responsive to sensory stimuli, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, an autistic person may find that they’re constantly aware of a ticking clock at a friend’s house or really sensitive to the sound of a loud siren, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tatiana Maksimova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people with autism thrive on consistency. “The world we occupy is much more uncertain and unpredictable. So we go to routine as a way of self-soothing,” Neff said. When a routine is disrupted, strong &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/which-human-emotion-are-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emotions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt; may present, including intense irritability or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that the routine doesn’t need to be super strict, either; it’s a common misconception when people think about people with autism’s day-to-day schedule. Instead, it could be a strong preference for a certain mug every morning. Routine looks different for different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, big changes can be hard, too. “If they move [homes] or they move careers, this could create a season of insomnia or anxiety,” Neff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Routine can extend to certain behaviors as well. It also includes repetitive body movements, which is known as stimming, Neff added. &lt;a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, stimming behaviors can include body rocking, hand flapping, spinning, rubbing a specific surface, and squealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need For Solitude &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-health-lies-medical-myths?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;There Is No Cure&amp;quot;: Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health &amp;quot;Lies&amp;quot; People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"There Is No Cure": Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health "Lies" People Still Believe (But Really Shouldn't)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Jordan Siemens / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another common sign? “Needing solitude to recharge after social situations or really overstimulating situations — and overstimulating could be different for everyone — but that is a very typical hallmark of [autism],” Gardner-Wright said. This could mean feeling totally exhausted after a work presentation or a family party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal said this exhaustion comes from a term known as “camouflaging” or “masking.” “This is the idea that you have to really hide different facets of yourself or different behaviors in order to fit in what you think the expectations around you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while we all do this at times, the degree that autistic people have to camouflage aspects of themselves may result in a feeling of total drainage where afterward they report spending long periods of time alone or in dark and quiet places to recover, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tessers added that, from the outside, people have no idea when someone is camouflaging. “They’re doing what everybody wants or expects of them to some successful degree.” This could look like behaving as you “should” at work but going home and crashing and dreading the idea of having to do this camouflaging all over again tomorrow, Tessers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Intense Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Natalia Lebedinskaia / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A deep curiosity and passion for one particular activity or subject can also develop. “Our brains tend to gravitate with a lot of passion towards our area of interest and we become very invested in them and it’s also a way we self-soothe,” Neff said. This could mean building a career around a specific interest or knowing everything about a specific hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while everyone has interests — and many people have strong interests — Neff said autistic folks likely find a way to relate everything to their specific interest. For example, this could look like finding a way to talk about a favorite TV show even when the conversation revolves around current events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Allistic people can have a special interest but then it doesn’t become their lens for their whole world,” Neff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Dislike Of Small Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tom Werner / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-health-warning-signs-symptoms-shouldnt-ignore?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The &amp;quot;Small&amp;quot; Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The "Small" Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most people don’t love small talk, but for people with autism, small talk can feel totally exhausting or something that shouldn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They typically don’t enjoy small talk and perhaps found ways to avoid it,” Neff said. “Maybe they structured their life or their career in a way that they don’t have to do a lot of that allistic communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardner-Wright added that people who are on the spectrum tend to prefer deep, meaningful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Direct Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Manu Vega / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People with autism thrive on straightforwardness, with “really honest, clear communication being a strong preference,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neff said autistic people tend to be pretty literal. For example, when you say the phrase “it’s raining cats and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chelseamarshall/what-kind-of-dog-are-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dogs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;,” she said autistic people may picture literal cats and dogs falling from the sky in their mind, but then realize the person speaking is referring to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So, actually, I think it’s perhaps more precise to say we’re visual in our communication style versus literal, but it often shows up as being literal,” Neff said. Additionally, the communication style can be described as direct and honest. “What we say, we tend to say at face value,” Neff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think you have these signs, look to autistic voices for guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both Gardner-Wright and Neff recommend exploring the hashtag &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:#actuallyautistic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;#actuallyautistic&lt;/a&gt; on social media to listen to lived experiences and hear from people in your specific community about how this exists for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Discovering that you’re autistic as an adult can be really validating,” Gardner-Wright said. It can help you more fully understand yourself and your life. “But there can also be a grieving process for that,” she said, where you may wish you had this information when you were a kid so certain situations could have been different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Feeling a mix of grief and also excitement is very, very normal,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://embrace-autism.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:embrace-autism.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;embrace-autism.com&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful resource for free screening tools and tests to help you understand if you are autistic — though it is not diagnostic, they’re simply online guides to help arm you with information, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can reach out to mental health professionals, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Olga Pankova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Neff said it can be helpful to connect with a therapist to talk about this new discovery, but she stressed that it’s important to find one who is neurodivergent-affirming or -informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal agreed and said “we have a long way to go with respect to training medical professionals and mental health professionals about autism. I worry there’s a lot of misinformation and misconceptions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bal added that you can also look up autism centers near you for diagnosis or treatment, but noted that many have a yearslong waitlist and may focus only on children. If they can’t fit you in, Bal said, you can ask if they have resources they recommend, or look for community autism organizations to see if they have any resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, a community of supportive people can be helpful as well, which is where the #actuallyaustic hashtag — or other online communities — can be helpful.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-9-biggest-signs-of-autism-in-adulthood-goog_l_68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/unhinged-microfeminisms?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct&amp;quot; — Women Are Sharing The &amp;quot;Unhinged&amp;quot; Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct" — Women Are Sharing The "Unhinged" Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-bad-health-habits?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"They Had No Idea How Dangerous It Was."

Jordan Peterson, for instance, is a vocal proponent of an all-meat carnivore diet, which he &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLF29w6YqXs"&gt;compares favorably&lt;/a&gt; to the diets of hunter-gatherers and contrasts to contemporary diets he suggests have too many carbohydrates. “Maybe human beings should be in hunting mode all the time,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Sza90czz0"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate widely divergent diets shaped by climate, geography, and availability. And while they certainly ate meat, they had no guarantee of successful hunts and scant means of preserving fresh kills. In fact, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, that presents a peculiar twist: Putrefying meat attracted flies, which laid eggs that hatched into maggots, which in turn probably provided a ready source of protein to early hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ironically, then, part of the Paleolithic diet likely &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Carnivore influencers misunderstand not just where ancient humans got their animal protein, but also how much of it they ate. In &lt;em&gt;The Meat Question&lt;/em&gt;, a sprawling history of humans’ relationship to meat, anthropologist Josh Berson &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262042895/the-meat-question/"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;: “if anything, it is ‘modern’ urban populations, particularly in the United States, that exhibit specialization for animal consumption — not the foragers so often held up as models of a meat-eating subsistence strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In other words, those who suggest that we’ve fallen from pre-modern meat-eating &lt;em&gt;übermen&lt;/em&gt; to plant-gnawing and bug-curious &lt;em&gt;untermen &lt;/em&gt;have their history backward. It was only with the advent of modern factory farming that meat became so reliable and ubiquitous that Americans can now eat it three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="read-more-vox-coverage-of-the-science-culture-and-politics-of-meat" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Read more Vox coverage of the science, culture, and politics of meat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Myths about how we used to eat and, perhaps, should eat again, matter politically now more than ever. The image of prehistoric man the hunter looms over contemporary “&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/644298?seq=2"&gt;gastro-politics&lt;/a&gt;,” reflecting pervasive social and political anxieties about the food we eat. The Make America Healthy Again movement has been buoyed by a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/dining/meat-beef-restaurants-politics.html"&gt;growing cultural obsession&lt;/a&gt; with carnivore and paleo diets &lt;a href="/future-perfect/410565/protein-muscle-gain-weightlifting-plant-based-vegan"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/podcasts/the-daily/protein-bars-america.html"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; — entrails, tallow, and marrow &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/maga-cow-products-beef-tallow"&gt;are all chic&lt;/a&gt;; there &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/meat-will-make-america-healthy-again-federal-guidelines-nutrition-reform-protein-eded2b3e"&gt;are calls&lt;/a&gt; to double down on meat in federal nutrition guidelines. All of it dovetails with &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/193307/nature-solutionism-vaccines-beef-climate"&gt;a romanticization&lt;/a&gt; of “natural” pre-modern food system and &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391795/ultra-processed-foods-science-vegan-meat-rfk-maha"&gt;a distrust&lt;/a&gt; of all things “industrial” and “ultra-processed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And it’s hardly just a right-wing phenomenon. The use of Paleolithic humans as dietary role models isn’t so different from mainstream foodie mantras about ancestral diets like author Michael Pollan’s &lt;a href="https://time.com/archive/6677424/six-rules-for-eating-wisely/"&gt;famous advice&lt;/a&gt;: “Don’t eat anything your great-great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.” More recently, Pollan has fretted that the environmental benefits of meat alternatives may be offset by vague concerns about the health and safety of their “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/06/the-man-who-warned-us-about-upfs-michael-pollan-on-his-25-year-fight-with-the-food-industry"&gt;21 ingredients or whatever&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This sort of bias toward the traditional can sometimes result in what we might term “foodie horseshoe theory”: For instance, in his book &lt;em&gt;The Omnivore’s Dilemma&lt;/em&gt;, Pollan, a liberal Berkeley professor, idealizes the small-scale livestock rancher Joel Salatin, an anti-government agrarian who appears on carnivore diet advocate Jordan Peterson’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMjqphoMy0k"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; to attack veganism, “globalists,” and processed food alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For both left and right, myths about a romanticized past bolster present-day identities, politics, and eating habits while shielding them from debate about the food future we ought to create. Of the many problems with the modern food system, a paucity of meat is not one; research on food’s environmental impacts &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01201-2/abstract"&gt;points us toward&lt;/a&gt; the need to &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline"&gt;massively reduce meat consumption&lt;/a&gt;. But tackling that problem, and many others, means we first need to abandon myths rooted in bad history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-even-was-the-prehistoric-diet" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What even was the prehistoric diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; in 2017, in the midst of the paleo diet craze, renowned paleontologist Peter Ungar challenged not just the diet itself but its very epistemological foundations. “What was the ancestral human diet? The question itself makes no sense,” he &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/guest-blog/the-true-human-diet/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. What most distinguishes the human diet is its &lt;a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/meat-eating-among-the-earliest-humans"&gt;incredible adaptability&lt;/a&gt; across time and space. Our ancestors have, over the millennia, adapted to eating what was available in whatever quantities it was available. As Ungar noted, that can mean diets made up of almost entirely animal flesh and fat, or one consisting of mostly roots, tubers, and fruit. Trying to pin down a single “Paleolithic” or “ancestral” diet is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While the idea of Paleolithic eating summons images of humans as “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.24247"&gt;hypercarnivores&lt;/a&gt;,” or apex predators, humans are not naturally obligate carnivores like big cats. We are omnivores, capable of deriving nutrients from a vast variety of plant and animal sources. The role that meat played in our evolution, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0047248489900353"&gt;how much of it we ate&lt;/a&gt;, and how we got it (&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25801183.pdf"&gt;theories of scavenging carrion abound alongside those of near-constant hunting&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2115540119"&gt;remains the subject of vigorous debate among scholars&lt;/a&gt;, with plausible estimates, depending on the population, time period, and ecological context, ranging from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11090808/"&gt;very little&lt;/a&gt; to quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;What was the ancestral human diet?

It sometimes involves, quite literally, sifting through the trash of ancient peoples. &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/vertebrate-taphonomy/46D04213E462D5EAFF36C106EA192978"&gt;Animal bones&lt;/a&gt; with damage from fire, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X24001421"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt;, and butchering, for instance, can confirm animals were eaten, although it is difficult to determine frequency and quantity. While modern discussions of Paleolithic diets center on meat from a small number of livestock species farmed and eaten today, our ancestors ate a wide range of creatures, many now extinct or no longer used for food; the archeological record shows that rats, for example, were probably paleo-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Genomic and proteomic (protein) &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.0977"&gt;analyses&lt;/a&gt; of fossilized material can also help shed light on ancient diets, and the chemical composition of human bones offers additional clues. The notion among some scholars that early humans ate a superabundance of meat comes not just from ideas about their hunting habits gleaned from the fossil record, but also from high levels of stable nitrogen isotopes in fossilized skeletons, which can suggest high consumption of offal. But science progresses on proposing and testing alternative explanations, and researchers have more recently suggested &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24612646/"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; — and, now, maggots — as a source of all that nitrogen. The latter suggestion, put forth in the new &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, is rooted in the theory that meat, a relatively scarce resource, would be kept around even as it rotted — not just to be eaten, but also to allow maggots to hatch to provide a steady source of fresh, bite-size protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Of course, much of this is educated guesswork. Thus, many theories about ancestral diets are also supplemented with evidence from the eating habits of contemporary &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-nutr-111120-105520"&gt;hunter-gatherer societies&lt;/a&gt;, who act as empirically studiable stand-ins for long-gone ancestors. Ungar, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/guest-blog/the-true-human-diet/"&gt;contrasts&lt;/a&gt; the largely carnivorous fare of Alaska’s Tikiġaġmiut people with the plant-rich diets of the Gwi San people of the Kalahari. The authors of the &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; paper back up their archaeological sleuthing with historical reports of 19th-century Arctic and subarctic hunter-gatherer societies eating maggots growing in stored animal carcasses. Both the fossil and ethnohistorical records, they conclude, reveal early human populations not as hypercarnivores but as omnivorous opportunists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The closer we come to contemporary society, the more we know with greater certainty about what our ancestors ate. And here, too, the historical record fails to support ideas of persistent carnivory. If anything, the domestication of livestock, which first began to appear in the archaeological record 12,000 years ago, likely diminished meat’s role in human diets: Through millennia, farmed animals were often more valuable alive than dead, as a source of milk, wool, labor, and fertilizer, and as a store of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In medieval Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/ubiquitous-medieval-pigs"&gt;butchering pigs&lt;/a&gt; was a highly seasonal ritual, sometimes reserved for special occasions; in Imperial China, pigs &lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1093/envhis/emq143"&gt;were a symbol&lt;/a&gt; of prosperity; throughout much of South Asia, cattle regularly supplied dairy and manure, but beef consumption was forbidden. Far from being a dietary staple, meat’s role was fluid: by turns a sacred offering, a show of wealth, or a winter fallback. And in most cases, meat intake remained relatively low, at least by modern standards, until the &lt;a href="https://cadmus.eui.eu/server/api/core/bitstreams/3f848502-2a76-5370-a58c-597de9f19d68/content"&gt;very recent past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It wasn’t until around the turn of the 20th century that animal agriculture was industrialized. The adoption of assembly-line systems in slaughterhouses allowed for economies-of-scale killing of animals and standardization of cuts of meat, while selective breeding practices &lt;a href="https://books.google.de/books/about/Creating_Abundance.html?id=pjl7ywhnCCwC&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;amp;redir_esc=y"&gt;dramatically enhanced livestock productivity&lt;/a&gt;. As historian William Cronon &lt;a href="https://commonplace.online/article/natures-metropolis-at-30/"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt;, these advances, coupled with new technology like refrigerated rail cars and canning, quickly turned meat into a ubiquitous commodity. As crop agriculture also industrialized, animal feed became cheap, allowing for the advent of factory farms where animals like pigs and chickens were raised indoors for their entire lives and bred to grow to slaughter weight rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These extremely recent changes remade humanity’s relationship to meat. Over the past century, the entire agricultural value chain has been redesigned to feed, raise, and kill animals on an ever-greater scale. In 1909, just over 150 million chickens were sold for slaughter in the US. By 1949, &lt;a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41667073v5p6ch4.pdf"&gt;that number was close to 600 million&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, it was &lt;a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/pg15bd88s/k356c167m/z029r057b/pslaan25.pdf"&gt;9.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past half-century, American meat production has increased almost threefold and global meat production fivefold, a transformation that geographer Tony Weis has called the “&lt;a href="https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/towards-120-billion"&gt;meatification&lt;/a&gt;” of our food system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Modern humans, as much as our Paleolithic ancestors, as much as our great-great-grandparents, adapt our diets to our surroundings. And surrounded by ever-greater quantities of cheap meat, we ate more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="can-we-please-be-serious-about-food-policy" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Can we please be serious about food policy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Modern diets are fraught with anxiety, and with good reason. There is much about modernity and the modern food system to be anxious about, from its contribution to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.518039/full#h9"&gt;global climate change&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/well/eat/food-additive-ban.html"&gt;potential health impacts of some food additives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These are real problems, of course, but an anxious frame rooted in hyperbole, cliche, and nostalgia for free-grazing pigs doesn’t offer a clear perspective on what’s needed to address them. Instead, it serves up simplistic answers, like a wholesale rejection of modernity. But, ironically, hostility toward modern food technology and an effective regulatory state, whether by the foodie gurus, carnivore podcasters, &lt;a href="https://drjessicaknurick.substack.com/p/food-additives-and-the-maha-disconnect"&gt;MAHA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/24158356/raw-milk-pasteurization-h5n1-bird-flu-sales-consumption-government-trust"&gt;raw milk enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2025/4/thousands-of-fda-staff-fired-in-latest-rif"&gt;DOGE cost-cutters&lt;/a&gt;, might very well &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the quantity of rotting meat (and perhaps maggots) in our food, &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674728776"&gt;a problem in 19th-century America&lt;/a&gt; before the creation of the FDA and the widespread adoption of food refrigeration and preservation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Consider that the modern food system is, on balance, a great thing. Diseases of malnutrition &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27780/chapter-abstract/198026487?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;like pellagra and rickets&lt;/a&gt; have been banished to the past, as have the dangers of eating &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27780/chapter-abstract/198024009?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;contaminated, toxic, spoiled, or adulterated foods&lt;/a&gt;. It is only because &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20752979?mag=decline-malnutrition-world-eats-now&amp;amp;seq=1"&gt;food is more abundant, affordable, and safe&lt;/a&gt; than at any other time in human history that we can spare any attention to the chronic, long-term problems to which modern diets contribute, like obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Addressing those problems means embracing modernity rather than rejecting it. It requires actually engaging with the complexity of the food system, and facing up to a few uncomfortable truths, like the fact that it is meat in particular, and not food generally, that drives many of the food system’s harms. But in the face of complexity, a retreat to an unspoiled past offers both an escapist fantasy free of difficult tradeoffs and a handy justification for our worst dietary choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In an imagined past, meat consumption acts as a potent political signifier that binds us to our tribe. And food becomes a theater for performing politics and identity. For foodies who sneer at “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/02/mark-bittman-community-kitchen-restaurants"&gt;industrial food&lt;/a&gt;,” going back to small farms and eating supposedly “better” organic and regeneratively farmed meat may signal a commitment to &lt;a href="https://repprovisions.com/pages/why-rep-regenerative-beef-is-healthier-for-you?srsltid=AfmBOoo5pvvIi1MisWXWWH0l_VPhQ_SeHqrXjT8ThZAHNFyNSzbdFEDx"&gt;personal health and environmental justice&lt;/a&gt; that is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/23/organic-meat-production-just-as-bad-for-climate-study-finds"&gt;simply&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.816374/full"&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/better-meat-sourcing-climate-environmental-impacts"&gt;borne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13165-025-00493-w"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163735/myth-regenerative-ranching"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; science. On the right, the embrace of meat &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/171781/meat-culture-war-crickets"&gt;anchors a particular vision of politics&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5003066/beef-climate-change-american-men-masculinity"&gt;masculinity&lt;/a&gt; — that is fundamentally anti-modern, anti-liberal, and anti-“woke.” And so the modern food system (junk), liberal men (soy boys), and scientists and experts (globalists) can all be framed as an assault on a fundamental and personal bodily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But rather than a transgressive return to a lost past, meat-heavy diets not only represent the status quo but also rely entirely on the modern food system and its globe-spanning networks of exchange, cutting-edge logistics and infrastructure, highly capitalized multinational corporations, and sophisticated biotechnologies. Close factory farms and industrialized cattle feedlots, &lt;a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates"&gt;and 99 percent of chicken, 98 percent of pork, and 75 percent of beef&lt;/a&gt; in the US disappear overnight, making mass-scale carnivory impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;As is often the case with myths, those about ancestral diets are more about the anxieties and identities of their purveyors than it is about a real past or even a real present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Paradoxically, then, those who champion pre-modern diets can do so only because of the amenities and technologies of the modern world. At no other point in human history could someone opt for the meat of their choice for three meals every day, without getting any blood on their own hands, and then post about it on social media to claim they are living like their ancestors. If anything, the myth of meat’s transhistorical importance masks the fact that the meatiness of current diets is a historical flash in the pan, the result of a food system focused on overproducing meat, not an evolved set of inherent needs or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As is often the case with myths, those about Paleolithic, ancestral, and great-great-grandmotherly diets are more about the anxieties and identities of their purveyors than it is about a real past or even a real present. The very image of the primitive prehistoric hunter is less careful archeology and ethnography than it is a product of &lt;a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/refuting-a-myth-about-human-origins"&gt;modern misconceptions about human evolution&lt;/a&gt; mixed with &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/683202"&gt;popular culture pastiche&lt;/a&gt;, which makes self-styled primitivism quintessentially post-modern, as if the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-what-they-took-from-us-and-unbelievable-honkers-right-wing-nostalgia"&gt;this is what they took from us&lt;/a&gt;” meme was slapped over a picture of Fred Flintstone eating dinosaur ribs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;History shows us that there is no single way humans have eaten and no predetermined way we should eat. Diets are a product of the world we live in. And in that world, the questions we should be asking are not about what our ancestors ate — and whether we should therefore eat meat, berries, or maggots — but about what rational decisions we can make about our future. That includes asking why meat is so cheap and easy to buy, and whether it ought to remain so. The answers lie in science, public health, and political economy, and not in myths. The diets of the long dead are a red herring at best, red meat for reactionary politics at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQbThIOVF5NmNCNE5WTUdOOHhtS2o2S2JRRjFNUWRqQmhneXM4QnNkVWR6YXoydFFLV2dYbmltWXpnN1FZN183Q0h1Z0U3ZEN2VzdNYXNOQVhJRmZBRTFUMWUyeFBTdEpScHFWZDRmTW1EazhZZ1A5cDFjWTFCRGo3X3h3RE5WX1U3cTgwWEVZZDNRRFE4MTVudA</guid></item><item><title>隐藏在大脑深处的信号可以跟踪帕金森症状- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-deep-in-your-brain-could-track-parkinsons-symptoms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Although it was evident that these waves varied with symptom severity, the methods used to interpret the buzz left a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mix of patient diversity, combinations of symptoms, and a lack of unaffected controls made it difficult to compare the brain-wave activity of diseased states with a 'healthy' standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pooling multiple datasets and comparing differences in similar activity between more-or-less affected basal ganglia in each brain hemisphere, the researchers behind this latest study could 'listen in' on harmonies hidden within the brain's roar.&lt;br&gt;

Your brain also needs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-made-a-video-game-that-boosts-short-term-memory-in-older-adults"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; to stay young and fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A digital brain exercise, developed by the American biotech company &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posit_Science_Corporation"&gt;Posit Science Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, has been put to the test by neurologists at McGill University in Canada, with some promising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rigorous, double-blinded controlled trial, 82 healthy adults over the age of 65 were randomly assigned to play either Posit's 'BrainHQ' app or a recreational computer game for thirty minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 weeks, brain scans revealed that those who played BrainHQ, which focused on speed-based challenges, showed measurable increases in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"&gt;cholinergic&lt;/a&gt; activity, a type of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/part-of-your-brain-acts-like-a-pause-button-that-freezes-your-whole-body"&gt;brain signalling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was seen in a part of their brain known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt; (ACC) – which supports selective attention, inhibitory control, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-type-of-activity-is-particularly-effective-at-keeping-your-brain-young"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Type of Activity Is Particularly Effective at Keeping Your Brain Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in cholinergic signaling was comparable in magnitude to how much the ACC usually shrinks over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The training restored cholinergic health to levels typically seen in someone 10 years younger," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/researchers-neuro-show-brain-exercise-yields-benefits-368265"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Etienne de Villers-Sidani from McGill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time any intervention, drug or non-drug, has been shown to do that in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179584" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-642x402.png" alt="Brain-Training App " class="wp-image-179584 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-642x402.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-1077x675.png 1077w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-768x481.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0-600x376.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/double-decisioneasy-_easy_level_0.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179584" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In the Double Decision exercise in the BrainHQ app, participants identified images on a screen at increasing speed.

That said, it is rigorously designed and uses advanced brain scanning techniques in collaboration with McGill neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We used a rare technology," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/researchers-neuro-show-brain-exercise-yields-benefits-368265"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; de Villers-Sidani.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe174qo000x26oyhb4y4qof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children may be more likely to be diagnosed with autism and other neurodevelopment disorders if their mother had a Covid-19 infection while pregnant, according to a new &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/9900/neurodevelopmental_outcomes_of_3_year_old_children.1392.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300043b6nzxm4apar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed more than 18,000 births that occurred in the Mass General Brigham health system between March 2020 and May 2021, assessing records for laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 tests among the mothers and for neurodevelopment diagnoses among their children through age 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300053b6nl7sqz3df@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found that children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopment disorder than those born to mothers who did not have an infection while pregnant: more than 16% versus less than 10%, or a 1.3 times higher risk after adjusting for other risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300073b6n1rgwvjnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, differences in risks were more pronounced among boys and in cases where the mother had a Covid-19 infection during the third trimester. Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300063b6na3bx6p6z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi300083b6nn0v0elm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1l1ce00023b6n7tk5ji48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/covid-19-during-pregnancy-linked-to-neurodevelopmental-disorders" target="_blank"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/autism-rate-cdc-report-2022"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi3000a3b6npcnyzrw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes"&gt;caused the autism epidemic&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1llo7000e3b6qgrzfaaue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a news conference in September on the “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/finding-the-cause-of-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;cause of autism&lt;/a&gt;,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/health/trump-autism-announcement-cause-tylenol"&gt;Tylenol during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi3000b3b6nzh9oih78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe17gi4000c3b6n4nxeot91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1pk6x00053b6n5tc239vt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

With that announcement came a four-week alert period, stretching through early November, that included higher levels of monitoring by local health teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Similar findings and warnings have also occurred in the Spanish towns of Tahivilla and La Luisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is West Nile virus concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In most cases, West Nile virus doesn't show any symptoms in humans. But in rare cases, people can develop symptoms that last for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The symptoms presented like a stroke. It was really worrying," Jim Skinner, who decided to retire after contracting West Nile virus, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w850qlx94o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told the BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told the BBC&lt;/a&gt;. "I had weakness down the left-hand side, palsy on the left-hand side, and I got tremors. … The weakness and tremors are still there a year on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even more concerning, however, is that West Nile virus cases appear to be increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials say 13 European countries saw a total of &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/2120538/horror-spain-deadly-virus-tourist-hotspot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:989 cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;989 cases&lt;/a&gt; of West Nile — including 63 deaths — between June and September, higher than the 10-year average of 687.

That heat-trapping pollution has caused global temperatures to rise, which has led to more of the warm, wet conditions in which mosquitoes thrive. Mosquito season is now longer in many parts of the world, and the insects have reached places that were once too cold for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can I do to avoid West Nile virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; note, there is no vaccine or medicine available to prevent West Nile.

The owner of Reichardt Duck Farm, which sits in the rolling hills between Petaluma and the Two Rock area, confirmed that his facility recently recorded positive cases of the dreaded virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;added to its public database&lt;/a&gt; a second incidence of the highly virulent avian flu in Sonoma County, this one at an egg farm. The Press Democrat was unable to immediately confirm the location of that outbreak, which resulted in the deaths of 231,000 birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing is a wake-up call. Two winters ago, when Sonoma County poultry farms were &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2024/01/12/sonoma-county-poultry-farmers-euthanize-thousands-more-birds-as-avian-flu-losses-devastate-local-industry/"&gt;ravaged by the spread of avian influenza&lt;/a&gt;, the first case didn’t hit until around Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreak is another blow to the Reichardt family. Their Middle Two Rock Road farm was also heavily affected in 2023-24, when it was &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/12/01/250000-birds-to-be-killed-at-2-petaluma-poultry-farms-after-avian-flu-detected-2/"&gt;the first of multiple local facilities &lt;/a&gt;infected by the deadly and highly virulent avian flu virus, which typically requires producers to destroy all of their birds on site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-8p60lgsb" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_8p60lgsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird flu outbreaks hit flocks at nine other chicken, duck and egg-laying facilities in the county that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Reichardt paused to talk to a reporter &lt;span&gt;Tuesday &lt;/span&gt;as his farm staff went about euthanizing 57,000 birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look at the last six years now, with &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/12/03/activism-prospective-ballot-fight-heighten-drama-of-sonoma-county-bird-flu-outbreak/"&gt;the DxE (animal liberation) raid&lt;/a&gt;, COVID, bird flu in ’23, now bird flu again in ’25. My older sister passed in 2020,” he said. “It’s been hit after hit. We’re looking for our fate to change at some point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reichardt Duck Farm is not to be confused with Liberty Ducks, a smaller Sonoma County&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;producer, owned by members of the same family but operating at a separate location.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreak was detected after Reichardt Duck Farm staff noticed “a modest increase in mortality” — eight dead birds — in one of the barns last week, Phil Reichardt said. The next morning, there were a few more than that. They took a sample of birds to UC Davis for analysis, and received confirmation of Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu, or HPAI, on Oct. 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duck farm began “depopulating” its flock Sunday, borrowing some machinery from Weber Family Farms, an egg facility that also was forced to put birds to death in 2023-24. Phil Reichardt expected to finish the grim task Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a departure from two years ago, when local ranchers knew much less about the spread of the pathogen and how best to block it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that previous round, Reichardt said, the farm received instructions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture the day before Thanksgiving. Because of the holiday, and a lower sense of urgency, they didn’t begin depopulating for six days. This time, Reichardt expected to be done five days after confirmation, which he hoped would reduce the chances of the flu hopping to another facility.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“The industry, unfortunately, is getting very good at this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report Thursday of another outbreak in one of the region’s bird farms demonstrates the limitations of that quick action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodrigo Gallardo, professor of poultry medicine at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and an expert in poultry RNA viruses, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely a concerted effort,” Gallardo said. “The California Department of Food and Agriculture usually helps with this, the USDA usually helps. We’re all at high alert. We’re approaching winter. And we have learned a lot of things about biosecurity and prevention. The hope is that we will reduce dissemination after one detection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations on biosecurity measures haven’t changed based on the new appearance of HPAI, said Sue Ostrom, Sonoma County’s assistant agricultural commissioner, because — as Reichardt alluded — producers have gotten the work pretty buttoned down since their unprecedented local losses in the winter season two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that led to,” Ostrom said, “is that producers understand what needs to happen. How we dispose of carcasses, bedding and so forth. They can get to that faster now.”&lt;/p&gt;

The farm had to destroy 550,000 chickens and 3.2 million eggs after an avian flu outbreak.

&lt;p&gt;The strain of bird flu detected in recent tests at Reichardt Duck Farm is the same as the one that swept Sonoma County two years ago, resulting in the &lt;span&gt;destruction of 1.2 million birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any real smoking gun,” Reichardt said. “We can only expect it was migratory birds flying overhead. We step into their droppings and enter the barns. We have foot pans in place, and we are careful to use them. But I guess we can’t hit everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like viruses transmitted among humans, HPAI tends to peak during the cold winter months. It generally spreads from migrating waterfowl to domesticated flocks along the major north-south flyways, including the Pacific Flyway that travels above Sonoma County. Researchers estimate 1 billion birds fly south along the Pacific Flyway each fall, and north again in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s normal, in a certain sense, to think cases will go up in the winter,” Gallardo said. “Usually, respiratory infections in chickens are related to changes in temperature and humidity. With birds migrating south, we’re right at a time when this might happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Reichardt Duck Farm was obligated to put down all of its birds, the business is not without prospects. Phil Reichardt estimated they have about 15,000 eggs currently incubating, and another 20,000-30,000 that are eligible to take that step soon. Those eggs must be moved off the property to raise elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an expensive process when no revenue is coming in,” Reichardt said. “But it’s all we know how to do. So we keep going even when it feels like we’re battering our heads against a brick wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/01/21/why-local-poultry-farmers-say-10-million-bird-flu-reimbursement-falls-short-2/"&gt;has an indemnity program&lt;/a&gt; that compensates poultry farmers for income lost to avian flu. In the 2023-24 outbreaks, affected Sonoma County farms received a total of $10.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reichardt said he’s appreciative of “anything that helps keep us afloat,” but noted that he and the department are far apart in their estimation of fair market value for the ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also is hoping to open a discussion on USDA depopulation requirements. Because the flu is so highly transmissible, the federal agency insists on complete depopulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Could we have euthanized the affected birds and monitored the others? And continue testing birds?” Reichardt wondered, noting that only a couple dozen were confirmed sick in the recent outbreak. “I think I understand USDA’s stance. This thing is terrible. When it takes hold, it’s like a wildfire. But I think there are other methods to put out the wildfire. It’s a depressing process to put down healthy, happy birds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duck farm must now wait four months before reintroducing birds, and it will takes months beyond that for young ducks to mature and become egg layers. Reichardt Duck Farm had yet to fully bounce back from late 2023, when the company was forced to euthanize more than 200,000 birds. The owner estimates that before getting the bad news last week, they were at about 40% of their pre-2023 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most depressing for Phil Reichardt is knowing there’s a good chance the staff members who have been handling the depopulation may soon find their hours slashed, or could even be laid off as some were two winters ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really gets me emotional. Some of them are family to us,” Reichardt said. “These people are working their butts off to put themselves out of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big California outbreak of 2023-24 was also in late October, at a turkey meat facility in Merced County. By the end of that winter, at least 6.3 million commercial birds had been killed in the state. In Sonoma County alone, officials estimated the financial loss to producers at around $22 million. The effects were felt well beyond farm properties, with &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/01/15/aftermath-of-bird-flu-lowers-supply-and-ups-cost-of-eggs-2/"&gt;egg prices skyrocketing in stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last winter was far more devastating statewide, with more than 16.5 million dead birds. But that pandemic left Sonoma County unscathed. This winter already threatens to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

This behavior appears to be a strategy to satisfy two distinct psychological needs: signaling social status and projecting a sense of personal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is often understood as a personality trait characterized by a grandiose sense of self, a persistent need for admiration, and a focus on one’s own importance. While this may project an image of supreme confidence, psychological research has shown that narcissism can exist alongside deep-seated feelings of insecurity, such as low self-esteem or a sense that one is not living as their “true self.” It is this particular combination of traits that interested the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, cultural taste was seen through the lens of social class. Sociologists argued that elites used their preference for “highbrow” culture, like classical music and fine art, to distinguish themselves from other social classes. In recent decades, however, this pattern has shifted. Observers have noted the rise of the “cultural omnivore,” an individual who appreciates both high-status cultural products and more popular, “lowbrow” forms like pop music or street art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors proposed that this modern trend might be explained not just by social class, but by specific personality dynamics. They hypothesized that people high in narcissism but low in self-security might use cultural consumption as a tool. Liking highbrow culture could serve their need to signal superior status, while an appreciation for lowbrow culture, often seen as more authentic, could help soothe their inner feelings of inauthenticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this idea, the researchers conducted two separate studies. In the first experiment, they surveyed 178 university students. Participants completed questionnaires designed to measure their levels of narcissism and self-esteem. They were then asked to rate how likely they would be to participate in a variety of cultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these activities were classified as highbrow, including attending a classical symphony or visiting art galleries. Others were categorized as lowbrow, such as going to pop concerts or viewing graffiti and street art. The researchers analyzed the data to see if there was a connection between the participants’ personality scores and their cultural intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed a distinct pattern. For individuals who scored high on the narcissism scale, having lower self-esteem was associated with a stronger intention to participate in highbrow cultural activities. A similar relationship appeared for lowbrow culture. The participants with high narcissism and low self-esteem also expressed a greater interest in lowbrow activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirmed that the insecure narcissist profile was linked to being a cultural omnivore, showing an appetite for both ends of the cultural spectrum. The analysis also suggested that this behavior was connected to a general motivation for “distinction seeking,” or a desire to establish a unique and notable identity through their choices. This relationship held even when the researchers accounted for other factors, like a person’s openness to new experiences or their own perception of their social status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study was designed to explore the specific motivations behind these dual preferences. The researchers wanted to confirm if status seeking was driving the interest in highbrow culture, while a need for integrity was behind the preference for lowbrow culture. This experiment involved 144 university students and used a slightly different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of measuring general self-esteem, the researchers measured a more specific form of insecurity known as self-alienation, which is the feeling of being out of touch with one’s true self. They also focused on a particular aspect of narcissism related to superiority and arrogance. Participants were then randomly assigned to read a biography of a fictional artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One version of the biography presented the artist as highbrow, noting that her paintings were exhibited in major museums around the world. The other version framed her as lowbrow, explaining that her work was given to family and friends before being discovered by an art dealer in her hometown. After reading one of the biographies, participants rated their interest in seeing the artist’s work. They also answered questions about their current motivations, including their desire to signal status and their need to project self-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this experiment provided clearer support for the researchers’ hypothesis. Among participants who read about the highbrow artist, those with the insecure narcissist profile showed greater interest in her work. This increased interest was statistically linked to a heightened desire for status at that moment. Consuming high-status art appeared to satisfy their need to be seen as having high status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the participants who read about the lowbrow artist, a different motivation was at play. In this case, the insecure narcissist group’s interest in the art was connected to their desire to signal self-integrity. The perceived authenticity of the lowbrow artist seemed to offer a way for these individuals to bolster their own shaky sense of self. The two studies together paint a nuanced picture of how personality can shape cultural tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research provides a new psychological perspective on a phenomenon that has largely been studied through a sociological framework. It suggests that for some people, the choice of what art to consume is not merely a matter of taste but a complex strategy for managing their identity and internal insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that their findings are based on statistical associations, and future research could explore these mechanisms further. For instance, an experiment could temporarily change a person’s feelings of security to see if it directly affects their cultural preferences. Researchers could also examine whether this pattern of behavior extends to other domains, such as luxury consumption, social media use, or even charitable giving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/aca0000303" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;How Insecure Narcissists Become Cultural Omnivores: Consuming Highbrow Culture for Status Seeking and Lowbrow Culture for Integrity Signaling&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hanna Shin and Nara Youn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 22:03:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxON2c5TFNxeEx6Z2M3d0xpekt3RUozU1l1X05xQmdvaE9GRXNOMERPZXVmVUFjUjJfYVBLd0Y1a3JNVlg1bzBCTHAwbHpxeVhXcURDbU0xSU0zS3NpS1VYbmZkTHp0VjRnSEJnYmtnb29zeEU1bHZXTlAxOFpSQ0ttOXdWc095S1lzWk1SV0V6R0hhUU1CNzI0</guid></item><item><title>专家揭示了超加工食品对身体的100种影响...以及如何扭转它们-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15243725/effects-ultra-processed-foods-junk-exercise-gut-hormones.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is no secret that high-fat, high-sugar ultra-processed foods make a person sluggish and depressed. It is also not a surprise that a sedentary lifestyle compounds those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent study, University College Cork researchers discovered that a two-month &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13135781/processed-foods-cigarettes-expert-cancer-heart-lung-disease.html"&gt;junk food diet&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;span&gt;that mirrored &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13399283/graphic-exactly-ultra-processed-foods-doing-body-including-ruining-skin-hair-depression.html"&gt;an ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; food (UPF) diet typical in the US, &lt;/span&gt;drastically altered the gut environment of rats, changing 100 out of 175 measured bacterial compounds and depleting specific metabolites that affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain and gut are closely connected via what scientists call the gut-brain axis, a complex and constant 'conversation' between the digestive system and brain, where gut bacteria produce compounds that directly influence mood, stress levels and cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the latest study, exercise combatted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-bdb7db90-b5d5-11f0-be90-313e077171fe"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; caused by a diet mirroring the one that Americans often adhere to, by rebalancing crucial metabolic hormones and restoring beneficial gut compounds.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity also reduced anxiety- and depression-like behavior and enhanced learning and memory in the rats who ate the junk food diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, it has been unclear whether exercise can reverse the unhealthy diet’s effects on mood, as well as cognitive behaviors, but this latest study suggests that it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that a primary way exercise combats depression is by repairing the gut microbiome, which is damaged by a poor diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The restored gut bacteria then release beneficial substances that travel from the gut to the brain, acting as crucial chemical signals to improve mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While exercise is known to improve mood and cognition, it has been unclear whether it can counteract the negative effects of an unhealthy diet on these same behaviors (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) dominate the American diet, accounting for roughly 70 percent of grocery items. The industrially engineered products contain artificial flavors and additives rarely found in home kitchens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their hyper-palatable, salty, and sweet design makes them hard to resist, with emerging research suggesting they may be addictive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans get about 55 percent of their daily calories from cheap, tasty and unhealthy manufactured foods. Diets made up mainly of these offenders are strongly linked to an increased risk of heart disease, heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is a consistent and growing body of evidence linking a diet high in UPFs to an increased risk of overall cancer and specific cancer types such as colorectal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 analysis found that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10285062/"&gt;every 10 percent increase&lt;/a&gt; in the proportion of UPFs in the diet was associated with a four percent higher risk of colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diets heavy in UPFs have also been associated with markedly higher rates of depression. In August, Turkish researchers reported that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12393073/"&gt;a 10 percent increase&lt;/a&gt; in UPF consumption per daily calorie intake increased the depression risk by 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure depression in rats, the Irish team conducted a swim test in which they measured the amount of time a rat spent immobile, floating passively and making only the minimal movements necessary to keep its head above water, an indication of despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers divided the rats into four distinct groups: one ate a healthy diet without access to a running wheel for exercise, a second ate an unhealthy 'cafeteria diet' without exercise, a third ate a healthy diet with voluntary running wheel access, and the fourth ate the unhealthy diet with exercise access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rats on the unhealthy diet spent significantly more time floating passively compared to the healthy diet group. However, when the rats with unhealthy diets had access to a running wheel between meals and then were put in the pool, this inactivity was reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Sedentary rats on a junk food diet ((CAF-SED) gave up swimming faster, a sign of depression. But when they exercised (CAF-EX), they kept swimming, showing that exercise reversed the diet's adverse effect on mood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They spent less time floating and more time actively swimming, just like the healthy rats. Rats were less likely to give up, which researchers interpret as indicating they were less depressed in the context of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While exercise had a minimal effect on the gut microbiomes of rats eating healthy food, it had a powerful restorative effect on the rats eating junk food, reversing dozens of the harmful changes caused by the poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unhealthy diet depleted three key gut compounds: anserine, a brain-protecting antioxidant; deoxyinosine, a building block for stable mood; and indole-3-carboxylate, which aids in the production of serotonin. The loss of these beneficial molecules disrupted crucial communication between the gut and the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise restored these compounds. Since these molecules are known to influence mood and brain function, this appears to be a primary way exercise combats diet-induced depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unhealthy diet spiked insulin and leptin levels, hormones that, when chronically elevated, are linked to depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the rats on the unhealthy diet exercised, researchers observed that insulin did not spike after eating, leptin levels were reduced and the body increased production of beneficial hormones that were reduced by the poor diet, such as GLP-1, which helps regulate blood sugar and promotes feelings of fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise effectively normalized these hormones, improving metabolic health and directly contributing to a better mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to performing a forced swim test after eight weeks, they also performed tests for anxiety and spatial memory. Rats were placed in a large pool of opaque water. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A hidden platform was submerged just below the surface, invisible to the rats. The rats had to learn and remember the location of the platform based on visual cues placed around the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the four training days, all groups of rats learned to find the hidden platform at a similar rate. The unhealthy diet did not severely impair their ability to learn the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most telling result came from analyzing how the rats searched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that sedentary rats on an unhealthy diet tended to use less efficient, more random swimming patterns, such as circling, while exercised rats on the same diet used more direct and purposeful search paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study’s results must be interpreted cautiously, as human studies are still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study’s lead author, Yvonne Nolan, professor in anatomy and neuroscience at University College Cork, said: ‘We studied young adult male rats only. While animal models provide valuable mechanistic insights, we cannot assume identical effects in humans, females, or different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our rats exercised voluntarily with continuous wheel access, which differs from structured human exercise programs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025a.0116/article-10.61373-bm025a.0116.xml#d96192e456"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

No treatment exists once symptoms appear. Currently, no exposures are identified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly, preventable viral disease spread through infected animal saliva. Humans and pets can contract it via bites or, rarely, through contact with saliva or brain tissue on broken skin or eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Mateo County Health investigates positive animal rabies tests, contacting exposed individuals for medical attention. If exposures are unknown, public notices are posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Mateo County averages two rabid bats yearly. In 2025, two bats have tested positive, including one found in Half Moon Bay on October 24, with no remaining risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone had contact with a bat at Little People’s Park at Portola Valley Town Center on Oct. 24, health officials advise they contact their medical provider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats that appear sick, injured or dead should be reported to the Peninsula Humane Society at 650-340-7022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 21:05:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5ERHBxU1dXaDk4dnJBeTNKdk9BNWtXMHFpRzRoNHkwZnZBaHZ2enllZUJuVnQwRDAwVXgzVHdEWjJMcUlHLUk0WEljN3V1c3dTWU9YVWVHRE1BeUVIMnlZQ0NsYjJTT2NnWmhncTdETlhidzc4U01WeVdlNWRtZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxNV05iZmctUGVRZjBJLURKbFJRLXNELURZdnBFYmJhblVoM3ZQUlJ3R0Fyb3ppVlR0NVN0X1p3RDRSdTFjTTEzcmJlRjQzZ0VMLWpBU0o2dDRJR0FoaHZqUm9INjhzVHBGR1B0OEZfTVB2X3lxVG5VUnJXa3QzQV8tU1pobDhTSmM2UTdmbDQ3eEVUemhSMUh3</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，怀孕期间的新冠肺炎与自闭症、发育问题有关-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/30/covid-19-pregnancy-autism-risk/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XSL5J7NUMRCJLNYOC34OKCRIT4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children born to mothers infected with covid-19 during pregnancy faced a higher risk of autism, along with other neurological differences such as delays in speech and motor development, according to a study published Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 21:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQZ1VrX21ndXUtRUlfVEJJckxFcXU4Z0lacGdvSEwxMmd1ck03LWJkTHRRZkFKb0hyaWpxdS1xN1h3ME00azBNTjZiVEpfYy1xT2NUZ3N2QVUzWlk0alR4UFpjcE11TU5SMS1laUtMSHUtdUpZWjZaUW5teEVJTzJVWlZsaHhIVjA</guid></item><item><title>这些是痴呆症医生说您不应忽视的症状- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/symptoms-dementia-doctors-never-ignore-194200870.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;The Symptoms Dementia Doctors Wouldn’t Ignore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;getty images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happens. You’re mid-sentence when you realize you totally forgot what you’re saying, or you’re driving to work—on a route you’ve traveled 100 times—but you take a wrong turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that occasional forgetfulness, wrong turns, mind farts—whatever you want to call them—are a part of life, but that doesn’t make them any less unsettling, especially as you, or someone you love, gets older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65667352/dementia-misdiagnosed-normal-aging-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; affects more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. cases are expected to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:double by 2060;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;double by 2060&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s worth knowing when to take a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a67950962/excessive-sleepiness-dementia-symptom-new/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; seriously.

And, even if you’re not experiencing any decline, you can act now to reduce your risk. Up to 45 percent of dementia risk is modifiable, according to research in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/infographics-do/dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Anyone with a brain should be looking out for their brain health, from kids to elders,” says Georgina Aldridge, MD, a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of being proactive involves knowing which signs and symptoms to take seriously. The main symptom people associate with declining brain health is forgetfulness, especially during older age, but it’s far from the only indication that something could be off. Many common symptoms fall into one of the following categories, per Dr. Aldridge: short-term memory, language, visual-spatial, executive (thinking, planning, solving problems), and behavioral. That said, everyone is different, and a person may experience any combination of symptoms depending on their condition and stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, doctors share the specific symptoms they wouldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/providers/georgina-m-aldridge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Georgina Aldridge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgina Aldridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care. &lt;a href="https://www.sutterhealth.org/research/investigators/armen-moughamian-1049681097" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Armen Moughamian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Armen Moughamian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC). &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1720493141/shae-datta" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shae Datta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shae Datta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Symptoms Brain Doctors Wouldn’t Ignore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Forgetfulness and short-term memory problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most widely-known signs of declining &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; are forgetfulness and/or having issues with short-term memory (your brain’s ability to hold limited information for a few seconds to hours). But it’s important to state upfront that memory issues in middle-aged adults could be due to any number of causes unrelated to dementia, Dr. Aldridge says, which is all the more reason to start a conversation with your doctor. “The person may have undiagnosed &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means they aren’t getting the good sleep that is necessary to form memories,” she says. “The person could also have a deficiency in a vitamin, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7077099/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:such as B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as B12&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that is necessary for the cells and nerves to function correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General forgetfulness can start in a person’s mid-50s or 60s, but it’s particularly important to look out for progressive changes in adults over 65 since the risk of a neurodegenerative brain disease like Alzheimer’s rises significantly with age, says Armen Moughamian, MD, the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgetting recent conversations or events can be a warning sign of mild cognitive impairment that may progress to dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease, says Dr. Moughamian. Sometimes this symptom is subtle: “Families might think their loved one just ‘wasn’t listening’ or ‘isn’t paying attention,’” Dr. Moughamian says. One way to tell if there may be something more serious going on is to take note of the consistency and frequency of these episodes. If it’s happening repeatedly, it’s worth having a conversation with a doctor, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Irregular sleep patterns or poor sleep quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it wasn’t clear already, practicing good &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68129140/how-to-get-good-deep-restorative-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the key to better health all-around, and that includes your brain. (In fact, lack of sleep in middle age may increase dementia risk, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-middle-age-may-increase-dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice that you haven’t been resting well lately, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s due to a brain disorder, but it’s worth getting to the bottom of. Feeling sleepy and excessive napping during the day &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; serve as an early marker of dementia, particularly for women in their 80s, per a 2025 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106755/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not concerned about dementia or Alzheimer’s, sleep influences brain health and vice versa, so to help your body function optimally, try to get your Zzzs in. “I often remind patients that sleep is one of the most effective ways to protect the brain,” says Shae Datta, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone. “Sleep is when the brain &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/neurons-help-flush-waste-out-of-brain-during-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:clears waste products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clears waste products&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and consolidates memories. When sleep quality declines, it can affect cognitive performance and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68915281/sleep-brain-aging-link/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-term brain health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just remember: Everyone’s sleep needs are different, but the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) recommends that most adults get between seven to nine hours per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mood, personality, or behavior changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in mood, personality, and behavior can all be signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s. Behavior change is broad, but it can often look like someone feeling suspicious of or threatened by others for little or no reason, showing unusual sexual behavior, becoming physically violent (like hitting someone else), and more, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-changes-behavior-and-communication/alzheimers-caregiving-managing-personality-and" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It can also look like a social faux pas like talking excessively to strangers, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“New-onset anxiety, depression, or irritability in your 60s can be an early and often overlooked sign of Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Moughamian says. “These mood changes frequently appear before any memory problems, signaling that something deeper may be happening in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, personality changes can suggest a specific condition called &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65090545/mom-dementia-diagnosis-marathons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frontotemporal dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FTD), Dr. Aldridge adds. FTD is one of the most common types of dementia that affect younger and middle-aged adults. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 40 and 65, but it can strike younger and older adults as well, and it affects women and men equally, per &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dementia/frontotemporal-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Struggling with language or trouble finding the right words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had the feeling that a word is “right on the tip of your tongue?” We’ve all been there, but experiencing new or worsening issues with language (past the occasional slip-up) can signal potential problems in the brain, Dr. Datta says. In cases of Alzheimer’s and dementia, this can look like having difficulty understanding complex sentences, dropping connecting words, struggling to name a familiar object, and more, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble finding everyday words mid-sentence or frequently “hitting a wall” in conversation is also potentially concerning and may point to early Alzheimer’s or another neurological condition, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Difficulty with everyday household skills and tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s that people experience have to do with the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/executive-function" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:executive function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive function&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; side of brain health, Dr. Aldridge says—basically, how you manage everyday tasks like making plans, solving problems, and making decisions. If you consistently have trouble with any of those things and didn’t necessarily struggle with them before, it could be a sign of dementia, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone stops cooking, stops managing medications, or misses paying bills, this is concerning,” he says. “People typically don’t just stop doing things, and often these changes are changes that are associated with dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Changes in visual-spatial awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with emerging brain health issues might encounter trouble with visual-spatial awareness, which is your brain’s ability to understand what you see and interpret the relationship between objects in space. Conditions like dementia can &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-215435" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:affect your vision;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;affect your vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so if you have trouble with something like depth perception—signing too high up on a check or not being able to find objects among clutter— it could be an &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/2/157" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early sign of Alzheimer’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early sign of Alzheimer’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or certain types of dementia, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person starts experiencing visual hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there), it could be a sign of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), a complex disorder involving abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These deposits, called “Lewy bodies,” affect chemicals in the brain, which can lead to changes in thinking and behavior. As a result, a person might experience visual hallucinations that are vivid and even scary in nature. (If the hallucinations are severe, doctors can prescribe medication, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re experiencing hallucinations, you should definitely see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you love are experiencing any of the above symptoms, it may be a good time to see a doctor. Although some cognitive changes come naturally with age, things could progress from mild cognitive impairment to something more serious—so, better to be proactive and see a neurologist who can help you navigate what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:55:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQZ0hHMDhXTXMxMHk0b0R0dmlfQ0FGbHFQRUhMcXYzaVcwXzRqeHBiTkdTZlFtNTN3b2ZmTjAxbmlGWjR3NTFaSlhnN1RSaVVHd3RES1NFQW42OTZMTFdsWXB2bVIxZHhZYmxYQjFITVZQcFd1ZVllYTdQMng3Rnp4SWh2eEpMdDAydkE</guid></item><item><title>金毛小狗采摘苹果是总可爱超负荷-PetHelpful</title><link>https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-puppies-picking-apples-is-cuteness-overload</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPUVVTQ2gxTTV1cnpJUi1RVy0tdEpSQkUtZVFyUkdpQ1dzT21zclFsOWNmdFBrc1BQalhwYUZ1MFUwVE50aGpadkpObE9nYXR6eFlFRFg4ZjBKMk95UlBuMWl6MHY5WEhXWjM3YVh3UHFpckl0QllzZmNtdVVlTXY3ZjBUSmd0UjhfRzUydExtdDNWMWFPT21B</guid></item><item><title>同步频率的合唱如何帮助您消化食物- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-10-chorus-synchronized-frequencies-digest-food.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synchronization abounds in nature: from the flashing lights of fireflies to the movement of fish wriggling through the ocean, biological systems are often in rhythmic movement with each other. The mechanics of how this synchronization happens are complex.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the vasculature of the brain, blood vessels oscillate, expanding and contracting as needed. When there is &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt;, the arterioles expand to increase blood flow, oxygen and nutrients. These oscillations are self-sustained, but the arterioles also work in concert with each other. How this happens is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uncover the answer, researchers at the University of California San Diego looked to another part of the body: the gut. Here they found that oscillators operating at similar frequencies lock onto each other in succession, creating a staircase effect. Their work appears in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/8njd-qd14" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biology in sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is known in the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+community/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific community&lt;/a&gt; that if you have a self-sustained oscillation, such as an arteriole, and you add an &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/external+stimulus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;external stimulus&lt;/a&gt; at a similar but not identical frequency, you can lock the two, meaning you can shift the frequency of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/oscillator/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oscillator&lt;/a&gt; to that of the external stimulus. In fact, it has been shown that if you connect two clocks, they will eventually synchronize their ticking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinguished Professor of Physics and Neurobiology David Kleinfeld found that if he applied an external stimulus to a neuron, the entire vasculature would lock at the same frequency. However, if he stimulated two sets of neurons at two different frequencies, something unexpected happened: some arterioles would lock at one frequency and others would lock at another frequency, forming a staircase effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Searching for an explanation, Kleinfeld enlisted the help of his colleague, Professor of Physics Massimo Vergassola, who specializes in understanding the physics of living systems, and then recruited Ecole Normale Supérieure graduate student Marie Sellier-Prono and Senior Researcher at the Institute for Complex Systems Massimo Cencini. Together, the researchers found they could use a classical model of coupled oscillators with an intestinal twist.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut oscillates naturally due to peristalsis—the contracting and relaxing of muscles in the digestive tract—and provided a simplified model over the complex network of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. The intestine is unidirectional, meaning frequencies shift in one direction in a gradient from higher to lower. This is what enables food to move in one direction from the beginning of the small intestine to the end of the large intestine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Coupled oscillators talk to each other and each section of the intestine is an oscillator that talks to the other sections near it," stated Vergassola. "Normally, coupled oscillators are studied in a homogeneous setting, meaning all the oscillators are at more or less similar frequencies. In our case, the oscillators were more varied, just as in the intestine and the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studying the coupled oscillators in the gut, past researchers observed that there is indeed a staircase effect where similar frequencies lock onto those around it, allowing for the rhythmic movement of food through the digestive tract. But the height of the rises or breaks, the length of the stair runs or frequencies, and the conditions under which the staircase phenomenon occurred—essential features of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/biological+systems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological systems&lt;/a&gt;—was something which had not been determined until now.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;This new mathematical solution answers two longstanding biological questions at the same time: how food moves through the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/digestive+tract/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;digestive tract&lt;/a&gt; and how it is churned. The team hopes this work will support further research into peristalsis-related digestive &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+issues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt; known as gastrointestinal motility disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The mathematics had been solved in an approximate way before now, but not in a way that gave you these breaks and what happens at the breaks. That's a critical discovery," stated Kleinfeld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that they've solved the question of oscillations in the gut, they're back to studying the complex vasculature of the brain. If the gut is unidirectional, the vasculature in the brain has hundreds of directions. While they both feature staircases, the one in the gut goes from one level to the next, one at a time. The stairs in the brain go along different paths at different lengths all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; is infinitely more complicated than the gut, but this is science at its best," said Kleinfeld. "You ask one question, it leads you somewhere else, you solve that problem, then return to your original question."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retinal implant the size of a strawberry seed co-created by a University of Pittsburgh researcher has helped partially restore vision for older people suffering from macular degeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in Europe and co-led by Dr. José-Alain Sahel, chair of Pitt’s ophthalmology department and director of the UPMC Vision Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396?logout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed significant vision improvement after a year for 26 of 32 people who had the tiny device surgically implanted.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants were older than 60 and considered legally blind because of the disease, which affects part of the retina and erodes central vision, or people’s ability to clearly see things in front of them.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implant mimics the light-sensitive cells destroyed by macular degeneration. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahel described the device, which measures just 2 millimeters each way, as a “miniaturized solar panel.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be paired with specialized glasses. A small camera mounted on the frame captures images and sends them to a cell phone-sized processor in the user’s pocket. The information goes back up to the camera and is projected onto the implant.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, the brain’s normal vision processes take over and, in many cases, patients who are nearly blind regain some of their vision.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the implant, participants couldn’t see the first or second line of a vision chart. A year in, patients saw an average improvement of five lines, with one being able to see 12 more lines than before.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can read letters, they can read words and some of them can read a book, which is something we didn’t even really think could happen,” Sahel said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one patient reported being able to navigate the subway again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Disease afflicts millions&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is called PRIMA, and has been in development for 20 years. Along with Sahel, Stanford University professor and study co-author Daniel Palanker has been a driving force behind this research.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two past pilot studies showed promise, but “this is the first study of this size and this level of improvement that has ever been achieved in this field,” Sahel said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced macular degeneration affects more than 5 million people worldwide, according to the researchers. For those older than 80, it’s the leading cause of irreversible blindness.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease progressively blurs, darkens and distorts the center of the field of vision, while leaving peripheral vision intact.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late stages of macular degeneration, central vision goes completely dark. Existing treatments can only slow the disease’s advance.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients tend to just see zaps of light after surgery, Sahel explained, but through a training program, the brain learns to better process the implant’s signals. This usually takes a few weeks.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at its best, the bionic vision is limited. It appears in black and white and can be somewhat blurry.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahel and other researchers are working on a next-generation device with higher resolution.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIMA has the potential to restore vision in patients with other diseases, as long as they have a functional optical nerve. It cannot compensate for eye trauma, for instance.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Working with regulators&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device manufacturer, Science Corp., is working to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe for use beyond clinical trials.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science hopes to make PRIMA available in Europe by the end of 2026, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth McKenzie.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not give a target date in the U.S., but said the company is engaged in an approval process with the federal Food and Drug Administration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will likely look at some of the negative effects reported in the study, mostly related to the surgery, rather than the device itself.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure is done in most cases under general anesthesia, as opposed to just numbing the eye. To insert the chip, surgeons make a small incision into the retina — the back part of the eye used to detect light — and place the chip underneath it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequent side effects were pressure in the eyes, bleeding and small rips at the edges of the retina.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None were life-threatening, and nearly all resolved quickly.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies already proved to Sahel the device was safe and effective. After these latest results, widespread use of PRIMA appears closer than ever.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal was to show this is scalable,” he said.

&lt;/p&gt;

You’re mid-sentence when you realize you totally forgot what you’re saying, or you’re driving to work—on a route you’ve traveled 100 times—but you take a wrong turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The truth is that occasional forgetfulness, wrong turns, mind farts—whatever you want to call them—are a part of life, but that doesn’t make them any less unsettling, especially as you, or someone you love, gets older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65667352/dementia-misdiagnosed-normal-aging-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; affects more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. cases are expected to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:double by 2060;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;double by 2060&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s worth knowing when to take a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a67950962/excessive-sleepiness-dementia-symptom-new/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; seriously. When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68148089/how-to-improve-brain-health-doctor-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, knowing and understanding the signs of a potential problem can be a huge asset because acting at the earliest signs of cognitive changes can make a big difference. And, even if you’re not experiencing any decline, you can act now to reduce your risk. Up to 45 percent of dementia risk is modifiable, according to research in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/infographics-do/dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Anyone with a brain should be looking out for their brain health, from kids to elders,” says Georgina Aldridge, MD, a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of being proactive involves knowing which signs and symptoms to take seriously. The main symptom people associate with declining brain health is forgetfulness, especially during older age, but it’s far from the only indication that something could be off. Many common symptoms fall into one of the following categories, per Dr. Aldridge: short-term memory, language, visual-spatial, executive (thinking, planning, solving problems), and behavioral. That said, everyone is different, and a person may experience any combination of symptoms depending on their condition and stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ahead, doctors share the specific symptoms they wouldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/providers/georgina-m-aldridge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Georgina Aldridge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgina Aldridge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at University of Iowa Health Care. &lt;a href="https://www.sutterhealth.org/research/investigators/armen-moughamian-1049681097" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Armen Moughamian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Armen Moughamian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC). &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1720493141/shae-datta" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shae Datta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shae Datta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Symptoms Brain Doctors Wouldn’t Ignore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Forgetfulness and short-term memory problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most widely-known signs of declining &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; are forgetfulness and/or having issues with short-term memory (your brain’s ability to hold limited information for a few seconds to hours). But it’s important to state upfront that memory issues in middle-aged adults could be due to any number of causes unrelated to dementia, Dr. Aldridge says, which is all the more reason to start a conversation with your doctor. “The person may have undiagnosed &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means they aren’t getting the good sleep that is necessary to form memories,” she says. “The person could also have a deficiency in a vitamin, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7077099/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:such as B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as B12&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that is necessary for the cells and nerves to function correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;General forgetfulness can start in a person’s mid-50s or 60s, but it’s particularly important to look out for progressive changes in adults over 65 since the risk of a neurodegenerative brain disease like Alzheimer’s rises significantly with age, says Armen Moughamian, MD, the medical director of the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center at Sutter’s California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Forgetting recent conversations or events can be a warning sign of mild cognitive impairment that may progress to dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease, says Dr. Moughamian. Sometimes this symptom is subtle: “Families might think their loved one just ‘wasn’t listening’ or ‘isn’t paying attention,’” Dr. Moughamian says. One way to tell if there may be something more serious going on is to take note of the consistency and frequency of these episodes. If it’s happening repeatedly, it’s worth having a conversation with a doctor, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Irregular sleep patterns or poor sleep quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If it wasn’t clear already, practicing good &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68129140/how-to-get-good-deep-restorative-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the key to better health all-around, and that includes your brain. (In fact, lack of sleep in middle age may increase dementia risk, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-middle-age-may-increase-dementia-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you notice that you haven’t been resting well lately, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s due to a brain disorder, but it’s worth getting to the bottom of. Feeling sleepy and excessive napping during the day &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; serve as an early marker of dementia, particularly for women in their 80s, per a 2025 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106755/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if you’re not concerned about dementia or Alzheimer’s, sleep influences brain health and vice versa, so to help your body function optimally, try to get your Zzzs in. “I often remind patients that sleep is one of the most effective ways to protect the brain,” says Shae Datta, MD, is a neurologist at NYU Langone. “Sleep is when the brain &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/neurons-help-flush-waste-out-of-brain-during-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:clears waste products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;clears waste products&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and consolidates memories. When sleep quality declines, it can affect cognitive performance and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a68915281/sleep-brain-aging-link/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long-term brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-term brain health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just remember: Everyone’s sleep needs are different, but the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) recommends that most adults get between seven to nine hours per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mood, personality, or behavior changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Changes in mood, personality, and behavior can all be signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s. Behavior change is broad, but it can often look like someone feeling suspicious of or threatened by others for little or no reason, showing unusual sexual behavior, becoming physically violent (like hitting someone else), and more, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-changes-behavior-and-communication/alzheimers-caregiving-managing-personality-and" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It can also look like a social faux pas like talking excessively to strangers, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“New-onset anxiety, depression, or irritability in your 60s can be an early and often overlooked sign of Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Moughamian says. “These mood changes frequently appear before any memory problems, signaling that something deeper may be happening in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sometimes, personality changes can suggest a specific condition called &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65090545/mom-dementia-diagnosis-marathons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frontotemporal dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FTD), Dr. Aldridge adds. FTD is one of the most common types of dementia that affect younger and middle-aged adults. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 40 and 65, but it can strike younger and older adults as well, and it affects women and men equally, per &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dementia/frontotemporal-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Struggling with language or trouble finding the right words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Have you ever had the feeling that a word is “right on the tip of your tongue?” We’ve all been there, but experiencing new or worsening issues with language (past the occasional slip-up) can signal potential problems in the brain, Dr. Datta says. In cases of Alzheimer’s and dementia, this can look like having difficulty understanding complex sentences, dropping connecting words, struggling to name a familiar object, and more, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Trouble finding everyday words mid-sentence or frequently “hitting a wall” in conversation is also potentially concerning and may point to early Alzheimer’s or another neurological condition, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Difficulty with everyday household skills and tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the most common symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s that people experience have to do with the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/executive-function" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:executive function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;executive function&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; side of brain health, Dr. Aldridge says—basically, how you manage everyday tasks like making plans, solving problems, and making decisions. If you consistently have trouble with any of those things and didn’t necessarily struggle with them before, it could be a sign of dementia, Dr. Moughamian says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If someone stops cooking, stops managing medications, or misses paying bills, this is concerning,” he says. “People typically don’t just stop doing things, and often these changes are changes that are associated with dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Changes in visual-spatial awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People with emerging brain health issues might encounter trouble with visual-spatial awareness, which is your brain’s ability to understand what you see and interpret the relationship between objects in space. Conditions like dementia can &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-215435" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:affect your vision;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;affect your vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so if you have trouble with something like depth perception—signing too high up on a check or not being able to find objects among clutter— it could be an &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/2/157" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early sign of Alzheimer’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;early sign of Alzheimer’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or certain types of dementia, Dr. Aldridge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If a person starts experiencing visual hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there), it could be a sign of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), a complex disorder involving abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These deposits, called “Lewy bodies,” affect chemicals in the brain, which can lead to changes in thinking and behavior. As a result, a person might experience visual hallucinations that are vivid and even scary in nature. (If the hallucinations are severe, doctors can prescribe medication, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re experiencing hallucinations, you should definitely see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you or someone you love are experiencing any of the above symptoms, it may be a good time to see a doctor.
