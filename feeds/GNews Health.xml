And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:released Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How high blood pressure is treated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure during pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including GLP-1s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Singapore</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 03:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQVG45MC10M0hxMnRhSXB6YWppOHN3WGd3NXpzTGUwM1l2dEpqZFNMaTZJdzllMUdPUDJWbGdrdHQ0MW93QU5YbzZnUVlFOWxjMGVTRVFuTm9pcFc5RDVIazNwSmRneUJ6VEphSWdIV2paVE1xVTF6OUQwZGVFOEVON1JYZDFINUN2TGZjVlBn</guid></item><item><title>这种饮食有助于降低痴呆症风险，我们可能最终知道原因- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOQ25vSVdIX3UyYmlyQ1VCMXJfU1R6WVZwNnlUdFJhMTFPSmZUanRuU2tTRnVORG9hVUdsVjd4QkJoZW1SN3N1YjR5WEJ6NzRlcjNXRi1HUlpDcF9HYi15eDk3ZTR6dnU4cWo4ZXdYNm0xZ3R2STEtN2w4QWhQUnpoYlRiU1NyRXJyaDMwQzJuRURJRlN4MHhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet and others like it have been extensively linked to reducing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mediterranean-diet-could-protect-against-a-common-form-of-liver-disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/12-year-study-reveals-how-the-mediterranean-diet-might-affect-your-brain"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;. Now a new study provides more evidence that this choice of foods can protect against dementia – as well as giving us some clues as to why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago wanted to look specifically at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_diet"&gt;the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet&lt;/a&gt;, which combines elements of the Mediterranean diet with the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of acronyms, but it essentially means lots of vegetables, whole grains, fish, and poultry, and not so much dairy, red meat, and fried food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ask-yourself-these-4-questions-before-you-start-a-new-diet"&gt;Ask Yourself These 4 Questions Before You Start a New Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated links between this balance of food items and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampal_sclerosis"&gt;hippocampal sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; – a condition linked to dementia and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170804" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, where neurons die off in the brain's hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the postmortem brains of 809 people for whom diet information had been logged for several years before their death, the study found that those who stuck closest to the MIND diet were less likely to show signs of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that consuming a healthy diet, such as the MIND diet, may decrease the likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis and may support hippocampal health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg" alt="Brain scan" class="wp-image-170808 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1-600x362.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers connected certain types of brain damage to diet choices. (Agarwal et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Netw. Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet's impact on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sticking-to-the-mind-diet-could-reduce-your-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-4-healthy-diets-with-up-to-28-lower-dementia-risk"&gt;well established&lt;/a&gt; by prior research. This latest study offers fresh insight into a significant part of the reason why that link is there: the foods in the MIND diet appear to protect the hippocampus in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to remembering, learning, and navigating, damage to the hippocampus is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-one-isolated-brain-change-may-signal-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;closely tied to dementia&lt;/a&gt;. While not everyone with hippocampal sclerosis has dementia, or vice versa, there's a significant overlap between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research accounted for a variety of demographic and genetic factors, but isn't enough to prove direct cause and effect. What it does show, together with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;, is a strong probability that dementia risk is to some extent affected by what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To our knowledge these are the first findings in human studies to report that the association of diet and dementia is partially mediated by hippocampal sclerosis," nutrition epidemiologist Puja Agarwal told Hannah Millington at &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alzheimers-dementia-mind-diet-food-disease-prevention-2110316"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear how hippocampal sclerosis gets started, but scientists are continuing to discover more about it, and its connections to dementia. It's not the first time it's been shown that the health of this part of the brain could be &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2024.03.015"&gt;affected by diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may endeavor to understand why this link exists. It's possible that the anti-inflammatory and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"&gt;antioxidant effects&lt;/a&gt; of the foods in the MIND diet are helping to guard the brain's neurons from damage in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To further understand the mechanisms linking diet and nutrients with the overall brain health, investigating diet's relationship with other biomarkers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain will be critical," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It starts as a painless sore where the infection entered the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This infection is easily treated with an antibiotic when caught early. If left untreated, it often progresses, over weeks or months, to a worsening rash that may be accompanied by symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache and fatigue, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms can resolve on their own over time but without treatment, syphilis enters a "latent stage," or asymptomatic stage, that can last for years and may progress further to a "tertiary stage" that can impact multiple organs in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;Congenital syphilis occurs&lt;/a&gt; when a pregnant person with untreated syphilis passes the infection to their baby either during pregnancy or at birth. It can be treated with antibiotics and it's best to treat as soon as possible to prevent more severe complications of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC recommends that all pregnant people get tested for syphilis at their first health care visit after learning they are pregnant. Some places with higher rates of this infection may recommend additional screening throughout pregnancy and at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Partridge said women of childbearing age who have barriers to prenatal care are at greater risk because they may miss out on syphilis screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I see a lot of times that moms don't get those full screenings done, they don't have access to that kind of prenatal care.

"What concerns me, though, is it should be zero."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kristin Wall, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told ABC News the U.S. has seen a steady rise in congenital syphilis cases over the last 10 years. This is despite decreases in cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She said that there are racial/ethnic disparities when it comes to the populations experiencing the highest rates of congenital syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So the highest rates we're seeing are in Native Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Hispanic populations and Black populations," Wall said. "And I think it's really important to think about access to care barriers as one of the big reasons that we're seeing these increasing rates in certain populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Barriers can include lack of insurance or lack of transportation as well as mistrust of the medical system due to past prejudices, according to Wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How to drive down rates of congenital syphilis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wall said half of cases are occurring among patients who are receiving prenatal care, but are missing timely and appropriate treatment, and the other half are occurring in people who are not engaged in care at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For those who are receiving prenatal care, Wall said there is a push to implement point-of-care testing, meaning testing outside of a traditional clinical laboratory, often at the patient's bedside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Delays in waiting for laboratory test results to come back and then trying to recontact the patient can lead to delays in delivering a diagnosis or administering care, Wall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"A very exciting development to address that is the point of care syphilis testing, where you have a patient right in front of you, you're able to administer that test, get test results in 20, 30 minutes, and administer directly observed treatment right there, without sending, you know, your patient away," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the patients who are not receiving care, Wall said it's important to work with community partners to enter underserved communities and spread awareness, as well as make sure men and women are getting tested to prevent cases from occurring in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McDonald said that as part of an effort to eliminate syphilis from pregnancy, New York State &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/congenital_syphilis/providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;requires three syphilis screenings&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"When someone's pregnant, they're supposed to be checked for syphilis three times, one when they have their first visit, the second time around the third trimester, and then the third time is where they give birth," he said. "Part of our message to health care providers is: ensure people are being screened appropriately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He also encouraged people to practice safe sex to prevent the spread of STIs, including the use of condoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Jade A.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study links eating French fries three times a week to a 20% higher risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baked, boiled or mashed potatoes were not tied to increased diabetes risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swapping potatoes—especially fries—for whole grains lowered risk, while replacing them with white rice raised it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes may be a dinner staple, but they've long carried a mixed reputation—a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vegetables-to-eat-each-week-11746040" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-rich vegetable&lt;/a&gt; to some and a boring, unhealthy carb to others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The BMJ &lt;/em&gt;suggests it’s not the potato itself, but how it’s cooked and what you eat instead that matters.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; French fries were linked to a higher &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meat-diabetes-risk-study-11772952" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, while baked, boiled or mashed potatoes were not. Swapping potatoes—especially fries—for whole grains lowered that risk, but replacing them with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918184/is-white-rice-healthy-heres-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;refined carbs like white rice&lt;/a&gt; pushed it higher.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed about 30 years of diet and health data from more than 205,000 U.S. adults taking part in three major long-term studies—the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. All were health care workers and healthy when the research began. Every two to four years, they filled out detailed food questionnaires that included questions on how often they ate different kinds of potatoes, from French fries to baked, boiled or mashed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, the team identified &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;new cases of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; through follow-up questionnaires. They used statistical models to account for factors such as age, weight, lifestyle and overall diet so they could better isolate the role potato consumption might play in diabetes risk. They also examined how risk might change if potatoes were replaced with other carbohydrate sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the course of the study, 22,299 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Those who ate more potatoes overall tended to be less active, consume more calories and have lower diet quality, with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-inflammatory-foods-to-limit-11779534" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher intakes of red meat, refined grains and sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;. Baked, boiled or mashed potatoes were eaten much more often than French fries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After the researchers took those other lifestyle and diet factors into account, they found a clear pattern. Eating three extra servings of potatoes each week was linked to about a 5% higher rate of type 2 diabetes. The increase was much steeper for French fries, at around 20%, while baked, boiled or mashed potatoes did not show a significant change in risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the researchers modeled different food swaps, they saw a similar pattern. Replacing three weekly servings of potatoes with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grains-for-to-improve-insulin-resistance-8424201" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; lowered diabetes rates by about 8%. Making the same swap from fries cut the rate by about 19%. Swapping baked, boiled or mashed potatoes for whole grains resulted in a smaller 4% drop. However, replacing potatoes with white rice was linked to a higher risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth keeping in mind that this was an observational study, so it can’t prove that French fries directly cause type 2 diabetes. The findings show an association, meaning other unmeasured habits or health factors could still play a role in the results, even with adjustments for lifestyle and diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study isn’t telling you to give up potatoes. Instead, it’s a reminder to pay attention to how you prepare them and what you eat alongside them. Boiled, baked or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-potato-for-mashed-potatoes-according-to-chefs-8742394" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mashed potatoes&lt;/a&gt; can be part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy routine&lt;/a&gt;, especially when they’re paired with vegetables, healthy fats and protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; French fries are best enjoyed as occasional enjoyment rather than a staple. Having them once in a while is fine, but making them a frequent part of your meals can tip the balance away from your health goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to make a healthier swap, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290547/whole-grain-cooking-guide/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains like quinoa, farro, barley or brown rice&lt;/a&gt; are solid choices. Replacing potatoes with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;refined carbs&lt;/a&gt;—especially white rice—can push your risk in the opposite direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study found that French fries, but not baked, boiled or mashed potatoes, were linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes—and swapping fries or total potatoes for whole grains lowered that risk. Your overall eating habits, activity level and body weight still matter more for long-term health than any single food. Potatoes can be part of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;—it’s how they’re prepared and how often you eat them that makes the difference.&lt;br&gt;

As a result, the FDA said it had notified drugmakers of its “intent to take action” against the products, but added that it wouldn't do so immediately to give patients time to switch medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb5679" class="body-graf"&gt;“The agency urges patients taking these unapproved animal-derived thyroid medications to treat hypothyroidism to talk to their doctor,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5364be" class="body-graf"&gt;The statement in and of itself was nothing surprising. Warnings about unapproved drugs are standard fare for the FDA. What followed also wasn’t unheard of: social media backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6fa9f4" class="body-graf"&gt;But on Wednesday evening, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemingly reversed course, writing in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/drmakaryfda/status/1955783788040159558?s=46"&gt;post on X that &lt;/a&gt;the FDA was committed to pursuing the first-ever approval of desiccated thyroid extract, pending results of the ongoing clinical trials. “In the mean time, we will ensure access for all Americans,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0add89" class="body-graf"&gt;Five minutes later, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded. “Love your approach of using gold standard science and common sense, @DrMarkaryFDA,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1955785019194269945?s=46"&gt;Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ffc62" class="body-graf"&gt;So, what was this all about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-00f8fa" class="body-heading"&gt;Animal-derived thyroid pills &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f5aa62" class="body-graf"&gt;The thyroid — a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of the neck — helps regulate how the body uses energy by producing thyroid hormones. When it doesn’t produce enough, it can lead to hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms including unexplained &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/happens-stop-taking-wegovy-ozempic-many-people-regain-weight-rcna66282" target="_blank"&gt;weight gain,&lt;/a&gt; tiredness, sensitivity to cold, changes in menstrual cycles and symptoms of depression and anxiety, according &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284"&gt;to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The condition is more common in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6bfff" class="body-graf"&gt;The standard treatment is prescription thyroid hormone replacement therapy — basically, taking pills that contain the needed thyroid hormones. Typically one of two synthetic hormones, levothyroxine or liothyronine, or a combination of both, are prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa1b7a" class="body-graf"&gt;Some patients, however, turn to animal-derived thyroid pills either because they don’t respond well to the synthetic versions or want to take something marketed as natural, said Dr. Michael Weintraub, an endocrinologist at ​​NYU Langone Health in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-350ec4" class="body-graf"&gt;The pills — which aren’t FDA-approved — are made from dried thyroid glands, usually from pigs, and are sold under brand names like Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid, Nature-Thyroid and Natural Thyroid, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e25719" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1.5 million people in the U.S. were prescribed animal-derived thyroid pills in 2024, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee9441" class="body-graf"&gt;In the FDA statement warning against the animal-derived drugs, the agency said they may contain impurities that could result in infections and could also contain inconsistent levels of thyroid hormones, another risk for patients. Taking too much can cause unwanted effects, the FDA said, and too little could not be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-24024c" class="body-heading"&gt;The backlash&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-055410" class="body-graf"&gt;In the days that followed the FDA’s statement, patients and doctors took to social media to voice their opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7986bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“BREAKING FDA set to BAN natural desiccated thyroid medications. Millions rely on these for hypothyroidism who don’t respond well to synthetic thyroid pharmaceuticals,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/drwillcole/status/1955000605740527843"&gt;read one post from Will Cole&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine doctor. “Let your voice be heard. The FDA needs to change course on this one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-452c82" class="body-graf"&gt;Dave Asprey, the founder of Bulletproof Coffee, a coffee and supplement brand, &lt;a href="https://x.com/daveasprey/status/1954915041163026467?s=46"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “I found out I had very low thyroid levels in my mid-20s, and Hashimoto’s. Normal synthetic thyroid drugs did not work. Natural thyroid extract worked very well and I have been taking it for more than 25 years without a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d98fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Malone — an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-eight-new-members-rcna212477"&gt;anti-vaccine activist who was recently appointed by Kennedy to a vaccine advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://x.com/rwmalonemd/status/1955775248634139070?s=46&amp;amp;t=uVo2mMUKz5lRhylxUS3GKw"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the decision “terrible news — particularly for postmenopausal women.” He called on doctors and patients to contact the FDA in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ed9fe" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to a question about whether Makary’s post on Wednesday was in response to social media backlash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e57343" class="body-graf"&gt;When asked about whether the FDA would still take action against unapproved thyroid products, Nixon referred NBC News to the agency’s statement last week, which said, “FDA is not taking immediate action against manufacturers who make unapproved animal-derived thyroid medication to give patients time to transition to an FDA-approved medication to treat their hypothyroidism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e4b83" class="body-graf"&gt;Nixon added that the agency “will share additional information as it becomes available and as clinical trial results are released.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b88cde" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear which ongoing trials Makary and Nixon were referring to. &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01739972"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; lists a trial initiated by Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2012, but the trial’s status is currently marked as “unknown.” Allergan, the maker of Armour Thyroid, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04124705"&gt;completed a trial in 2021&lt;/a&gt; comparing its product to levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2b0364" class="body-heading"&gt;So, are these pills safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f1c78" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA was correct to issue its initial warning about the thyroid pills, noting that the animal-derived pills aren’t regulated by the agency and can pose significant risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d28af2" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA-approved synthetic versions usually replace one of two thyroid hormones: T4, the main hormone the thyroid produces, or T3, the active form of T4 that helps regulate energy and metabolism. Companies that make FDA-approved drugs must follow certain regulations, including consistent dosing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fbe87" class="body-graf"&gt;The animal-derived versions also contain the thyroid hormones, just like prescription medications, Cohen said, but because they’re unregulated, the amount they contain can be all over the place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9977b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Getting too much or too little thyroid hormone has long-term health risks,” he said. “If you take too much, it can damage your bones, it can damage your heart. If you take too little, if you’re not getting enough, a number of problems can occur too, including mood problems, like depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d94b06" class="body-graf"&gt;Weintraub, of ​​NYU Langone Health, said that tiny changes in thyroid hormone levels can have a big impact, so it’s important to get the dosage right. He noted that pigs naturally have much higher levels of T3 than humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17ac5c" class="body-graf"&gt;“It can lead to heart rhythm disturbances, which can be life-threatening. It can lead to bone degradation, which can lead to broken bones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d8adc" class="body-graf"&gt;Weintraub said he’s had patients who took animal-derived thyroid pills who’ve had issues with sleeping, had sensitivity to heat or developed osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d222ce" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, however, said that it would be unfair for the FDA to “suddenly yank” the animal-derived versions from the market “without dedicated reasons that they are harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7e340" class="body-graf"&gt;Spratt said that the animal-derived pills have been around for decades as a prescribable drug. (Weintraub said the animal-derived drugs were “grandfathered in,” meaning they were already on the market before current FDA standards for safety were put into place.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b976d5" class="body-graf"&gt;While Spratt said she prefers to prescribe the FDA-approved synthetic versions, the animal-derived versions offer an option for people who don’t respond well to the synthetic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a5428" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would welcome NIH funding on why some patients don’t feel as good on T4-only products,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8876be" class="body-graf"&gt;Weintraub said the synthetic versions don’t “necessarily help everyone’s symptoms, but there’s a more precise and safer way of treating that than resorting to a pig or cow thyroids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d45447" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;He said patients who don’t respond well to T4- or T3-only medications often do better on a combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 21:50:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQQjVKMmhVdkEzbmtDemRqWER3X1dPcTcxU0RqbGxBS2N5V3VhTUNkOFlLQ1kwTVN4M3UydlBMbWlQeVNZR1hHVGR2TzRMX1h5eDhkb0o2bUhSWWZNOGZiUGhJWGJuVjNIaUhjZENiSEpiS3ZLWjQ4VE9IUmk1OWtzRnpKZFFoeWY4TW1HWC1MRV94YlJvcUhScHdnWmRrQU1MeTFlQjdRcllJZHlaV0FN0gFWQVVfeXFMUDhYaHIwSmRWaWw0RmJRUkdZWDQ1and4dlhWRF9DREhOSDdGbG4zUXZMTmJfM2VLNlVILWkyNTZfeUdwZ1pVUndZTGVyaFV6N05kcDk5UkE</guid></item><item><title>纽约市宣布第四起与哈莱姆军团爆发有关的死亡事件，冷却塔受到影响- ABC7纽约</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxPemJZa0RaRHpBQjJGVzBFamJ1YnlVVm5taC1rOUV2eExpQmxZOW9SR3h1UHlPeFFGSEVxWHdYN21ka0E4RmlEbEJwcmN2RDB0dHJNT1ZYdjZ6cGRrUlU1a29FMHE0QjFmUFFqQXNQc0p6U2xkdURpWVlJcDZTaFkzT3I5V1piX1pRVnN4eW5CekZ5Mjh5M2xGMjFsUGtlWDhCd0xsQUg0V1dQcUNJQkVadjFsMG00RnZuY0d6ekZzQVBCVm80LUlCUHFjc1A?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;HARLEM, Manhattan (WABC) -- &lt;/span&gt;New York City officials announced another death on Thursday in connection to the Legionnaires' outbreak in Harlem, just hours after identifying 12 cooling towers in 10 Harlem buildings that tested positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The update comes weeks after the start of the outbreak that has now &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/central-harlem-legionnaires-outbreak-3-dead-90-diagnosed-disease-nyc-health-department-says/17506525/" target="_blank"&gt;resulted in 99 cases and four deaths.&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Mpox made for scary headlines in 2022 and 2023: tens of thousands of cases worldwide, with &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/mpox-one-year-later-where-is-the-u-s-today/" target="_blank"&gt;30,000 in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in just one year. There were reports of painful lesions and mammoth efforts to mobilize vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2025, it seems like just a memory. Only it's not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You see the agony the patient goes through. It's on another level," says Caroline Mugun, a nurse at an mpox isolation ward in Mombasa, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the virus has spread rapidly across borders in Africa. Twenty-four African countries are in the midst of mpox outbreaks — up from 13 a year ago, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For many of these countries — from Gambia to Kenya, from Uganda to South Sudan — this is the first time they've ever seen cases of mpox.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Today — Aug. 14 — marks the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This rare distinction indicates the highest level of alert. But critics say the global response has fallen dangerously short, despite the fact that $1.1 billion has been pledged by countries, foundations and international organizations to support mpox control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here is a look at where the mpox crisis stands and what that means for future outbreaks of other serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Walking blind"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Historically, mpox was associated with remote forested areas in west and central Africa. The virus was known for occasionally jumping from small wild animals to people, often children who hunted them. While it was initially called monkeypox because of lab cases in primates, the main carrier is thought to be other infected animals, like rodents. The name was changed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the WHO rang the alarm bells a year ago, mpox had a very different profile than in its early days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new strain of the virus — officially called clade 1b — had just emerged and was spreading fast, particularly among sex workers and their clientele. The epicenter of this outbreak was the war-torn eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Far from the forest, this area is known for immense mineral wealth, and it attracts laborers from many of the neighboring countries. Soon, the new strain was popping up in those nearby nations: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year to now, and the new strain has taken off. There have also been big outbreaks in Africa of the other mpox strain. By Africa CDC's count, there have been roughly 97,000 suspected mpox cases across the continent and nearly 600 deaths so far this year. However, mpox experts say, the numbers are likely a severe undercount.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Your case counts are kind of like shadows on a wall — they're not telling you that very precise picture," explains &lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/anne-rimoin" target="_blank"&gt;Anne Rimoin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and an mpox researcher. She says there are many reasons for this, including stigma associated with a sexually transmitted disease and a large portion of affected individuals living in remote areas where there's limited surveillance and diagnostic capacity. The result is that many mpox patients are likely not getting medical care and not getting recorded in the data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another reason for the imprecise figures is President Trump's cuts to foreign aid. The Democratic Republic of Congo was among the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance, and some of that money went to the mpox response, including the transportation of samples from clinics to laboratories for testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have really gone off a kind of data cliff," says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University. "We are flying blind. But since the response is so stalled, I'm not sure it's really flying. I think we're probably more like walking blind."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What data there is suggests that the geographic reach of the virus has expanded substantially but, in recent months and weeks, the number of cases on the continent seems to be dropping. This is making &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-le-polain-de-waroux-95a12034/?originalSubdomain=ch" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Olivier le Polain&lt;/a&gt;, the unit head of Epidemiology and Analytics for Response at the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, optimistic. "When all the information points toward the same types of trends, it gives us some confidence that the trend is genuine," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Three steps backwards"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with cases dropping, plenty of mpox specialists are raising grave concerns about the global response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This has basically been a very frustrating year," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Emory University. "I feel like for every two steps of progress that have been made, there have been three steps backwards."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji and others can tick off a whole range of reasons for why the virus remains uncontrolled. For starters, the epicenter of the epidemic — in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo — is in the midst of a brutal conflict, with rebels in control of key cities and little medical care available. Another big issue: This outbreak has overlapped with a dramatic drop in global health aid both from the U.S. and from a number of European countries, such as France.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Mpox can certainly serve as a textbook case study on how a global health crisis unfolds and evolves when you have biological risk colliding with political and economic forces," says Rimoin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many point to vaccines as the epitome of how the response has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox is a vaccine-preventable disease, and yet, to date, only about 886,000 people have been vaccinated in a dozen African countries. Just over 3 million doses have been delivered to the continent. That's according to Africa CDC, which had previously put the target at 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The challenges started early on: When the WHO declared the public health emergency, it still had not green-lit the mpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like: 'Well, you either have an emergency or you don't,'" says Beyrer. At the time, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/05/g-s1-20983/mpox-vaccines-africa-congo" target="_blank"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the notion that anyone was moving slowly, saying WHO experts didn't have complete information with which to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. "We will not take shortcuts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. vaccine donation is an example of a pledge that failed to fully materialize. Then-President Joe Biden promised to send &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121426/biden-mpox-unga-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ai" target="_blank"&gt;1 million doses&lt;/a&gt; to Africa in September 2024. However, as of July 2025, only about 90,000 had made it to the continent. Of the remaining doses, about half are now too close to their expiration date to ship, according to &lt;a href="https://epicentre.msf.org/en/epicentre/team/yap-boum-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Yap Boum&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy head of Africa CDC's mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They can no longer be sent to the continent, which is a huge loss, because that one dose of vaccine is $100," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Kenya, nurse Mugun — who works for Doctors Without Borders — says people want the mpox vaccine but the country has not yet launched an immunization program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the U.S. vaccine pledge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What about the future? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox researchers and doctors say the lackluster global response portends poorly for mpox's future potential as well as other disease threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji of Emory University worries that the lack of response may undercut the value of the WHO alert system. Same with Africa CDC's emergency declaration, which marked the first time the body ever issued a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. "If we have had the highest level of alert for 12 months on a particular emergency and that hasn't really put a dent in the containment, how impactful is this lever?" she asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, director-general of Africa CDC, disagrees with the suggestion that not much has happened to contain mpox. "Africa didn't have this capacity. It's now that we are building capacity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He pointed out that a year ago, no African country had granted regulatory approval for the mpox vaccine that the U.S. was hoping to send. Now, 17 countries have approved it. Similarly, he says, the laboratory network used to test suspected mpox cases has grown significantly in the hot spots. For example, Burundi had two labs capable of testing mpox a year ago and now has 56.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Plus, he adds, this is the first time there has been coordination and collaboration across the continent with an African body helping to lead the charge and fairly allocate resources. Kaseya argues that without the emergency declaration, the resources that have been pledged would not have materialized. Still, he acknowledges, there is a lot more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji agrees there is more work to do. She warns that the world is watching in real time as the virus becomes entrenched in the human population. "The virus will evolve the more opportunities that it is given," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rimoin says that so far in this mpox emergency, the U.S. has been largely spared — but that may not last. "Diseases we ignore abroad can quickly land on our doorstep," she says. "We've been lucky so far. I don't know how long our luck will hold out."&lt;/p&gt;

According to the report, the man had no prior psychiatric history when he arrived at the hospital "expressing concern that his neighbor was poisoning him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reported that he had been distilling his own water at home and appeared paranoid about the water he was offered. After lab tests and consultation with poison control, doctors found high levels of bromide in the body, as reported by NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the case report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once stabilized, the man revealed that he had conducted a "personal experiment" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its potential health risks. He said he had consulted ChatGPT before making the change, which he followed for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physicians did not have access to the man’s exact ChatGPT conversation logs. However, when they asked ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride could be replaced with, the AI suggested bromide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a specific health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a prior statement to Fox News, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/openai" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; the parent company has emphasized that the chatbot is not intended for treating any health condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have safety teams working on reducing risks and have trained our AI systems to encourage people to seek professional guidance," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report noted that bromide toxicity was more common in the early 1900s, when bromide salts were found in over-the-counter medications and sedatives and accounted for about 8% of psychiatric admissions. Today, bromide is primarily used in veterinary medicine as an anti-epileptic treatment for cats and dogs, according to the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said the syndrome is rare, but cases have recently re-emerged because bromide-containing substances have become more widely available online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新的血压指南建议提前开始治疗和不喝酒- yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOd0ZaMHhveHJPVEktM29oblNRbDhQNUJHSVUxTFBkUzZQb28zdnVhR2hNSUhQWWFJbTFLaXNoVVp5RXNCNzVWdW91NHk4UTZyWDY4QTk0MEdFWGZmeXJ3YVpVTTRjdFU4YU56a2hiSVBUMklhVDF4aUtBbTV6OHdkcTNPVVU4QWNoYlRFVGNvcGVBbmNxRkdfcmhCUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next time you get your blood pressure checked, expect your medical provider to be a bit more aggressive about high levels. And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:released Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;How high blood pressure is treated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure during pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including GLP-1s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:29:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOd0ZaMHhveHJPVEktM29oblNRbDhQNUJHSVUxTFBkUzZQb28zdnVhR2hNSUhQWWFJbTFLaXNoVVp5RXNCNzVWdW91NHk4UTZyWDY4QTk0MEdFWGZmeXJ3YVpVTTRjdFU4YU56a2hiSVBUMklhVDF4aUtBbTV6OHdkcTNPVVU4QWNoYlRFVGNvcGVBbmNxRkdfcmhCUQ</guid></item><item><title>自1991年以来，爱达荷州东部居民首次确诊麻疹病例- East Idaho News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOOWxMWDFsdFRLaW45M2tURXYtU09vNmRfWHhJODFOYXVUTHA4U1RLUXNFTlRlSDVGRXRtTXJCQmRNcmVSbjNqS2hjT0FjbXlROEFFTTk1eWg4UU5kLTF3SHpwSnY3b1Uxb09qR0pDNVFHb2JqaUh3V0VSTl9ubW9rNlJFX2JDNy1yWnNqTXlkaVMwaVVxUVhQeEFxVTdMdkQ5VUp0Q0E2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;IDAHO FALLS – Eastern Idaho Public Health reported a second local case of measles in Bonneville County on Thursday.

The individual was hospitalized with the severe, neuroinvasive form of the mosquito-borne illness, but is now out of the hospital and recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to public health officials, the individual was likely infected in late July near the Jordan River in the southern part of Salt Lake County. No additional details about the person are available due to health privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The department said in a news release that three Salt Lake County mosquito abatement districts have tested positive for West Nile virus: Magna, Salt Lake City and South Salt Lake Valley. Statewide, 108 mosquito samples have tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;To look for the virus, mosquitoes are trapped and then tested. Health officials call the collections “mosquito pools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But mosquitoes can travel several miles, so everyone in the area is encouraged to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-West-Nile-virus" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About West Nile virus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;West Nile virus is carried primarily by birds and spread by certain mosquitoes. Humans get it when a mosquito bites infected birds and then humans. But unlike birds, people do not get high enough levels of the virus in their bloodstream to infect mosquitoes who might then pass it on. So humans are called “dead-end hosts,” per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/causes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/causes/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC notes that it’s rare for a person to transmit it to someone else by way of blood transfusion, organ transplant or through pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. But it can happen, so those who were recently diagnosed with West Nile virus should not donate blood or bone marrow for 120 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms can appear within two days to two weeks and may include fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. The most severe form is neuroinvasive West Nile virus, which can be very serious or even deadly. The symptoms of severe West Nile can include high fever, stiff neck, disorientation, coma, tremors and muscle weakness or seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While 1 in 5 infected people develop symptoms, about 1 in 150 develop the serious, sometimes fatal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those most at risk of symptomatic West Nile virus are folks with compromised immune systems and adults 50 and older, per the health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The virus has no specific treatment; rather, care providers try to manage the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Preventing-West-Nile-virus" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Preventing West Nile virus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Since there’s no vaccine, the best prevention is avoiding mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department offers these tips from now until the first hard freeze: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an EPA-registered mosquito repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Directions for application vary, so follow the advice on the package.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re outside between dusk and dawn, when the type of mosquitoes that can carry the illness are active, wear long sleeves and pants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drain standing water in yards, including in plant trays, dog dishes, buckets and old tires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep roof gutters clear of debris.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and stock garden ponds with mosquito-eating fish or mosquito dunks. For help, contact your local mosquito abatement district.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure door and window screens are in good condition so mosquitoes cannot get inside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep weeds and tall grass cut short; adult mosquitoes look for these shady places to rest during hot days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 19:17:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNWhCbkNpN3VtSXV5M3c0RVlxLUowbWcwNnFXV3p4LWQ1VFFXYnRzTy1DMV9DVzg0R202MzZUWjMwQUtLX0VoSWZDQVA4bHR6ZG9GdzA2UzdFaDBwX1otZ0w2UTVLZEEtZU5TYnl2S2JYajg5NDZxVzB3V0VfR1pTc0s2Vk94bXRGV1BYM0xlYWlVeTRNWHowdHFIbw</guid></item><item><title>在鳕鱼角游泳者身上发现的可能导致食肉疾病的细菌- WCVB</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeTR0TVNUWHh4T1BvLXRzRFlDTUtERUt0WFYxTDRzRzBlRlktSkNNWTNkb2xjWG1VTUNjUEVrd1JjUDAzOWU0bU9fWHNMa1h3YlFvRXNzUkQ2QTg5azE3UEU3QktSaURpOTZBOHk2cWpOcGEwME9VR2YzVWllcXE5aXJwUEV4QnN3VmNoTzFQUzlNWmNCazlWQWZVVG9ja3N6THBTS2J2RWpaZUMx?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is warning residents and visitors about a dangerous bacterium that can cause a flesh-eating disease in a person who was swimming at a Cape Cod beach. A rare case of Vibrio vulnificus infection — a dangerous bacterium more commonly found in Gulf Coast states — was detected in a person who swam at a beach on Buzzards Bay, officials said."People with open wounds who spend time in the water, or those who consume contaminated shellfish, can develop an infection when the bacteria enter the body. Sometimes these infections can spread through the bloodstream and cause severe, even life-threatening illness," said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein.Some infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection in which the flesh around an open wound dies.There have been seven confirmed Vibrio vulnificus cases among Massachusetts residents in the last several years, including four that were likely exposed in the Bay State, officials said.People with liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, or thalassemia and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of disease are at greater risk for severe disease from Vibrio following exposure.Anyone with an open wound, including one from a recent surgery, piercing or tattoo, should cover it with a waterproof bandage or stay out of coastal waters.In addition to wound infections, Vibrio bacteria can also cause gastrointestinal illness when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters.

So far, Stratus has been confirmed in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; in 30 states, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But the public health giant said it’s likely COVID-19 cases are growing in 45 states and not declining anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/stratus-covid-variant-symptoms-rcna224723" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/stratus-covid-variant-symptoms-rcna224723"&gt;As Today put it&lt;/a&gt;, cases are “on the rise in nearly all U.S. states and COVID-related emergency room visits are up among all age groups, just in time for back-to-school season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Today reported that “XFG was given its cloud-themed nickname ‘Stratus’ on X by evolutionary biologist T. Ryan Gregory, who also coined Nimbus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Stratus or XFG variant transmits easily and is spreading worldwide. Stratus is a combination of variants F.7 and LP.8.1.2. While it didn’t account for a single reported U.S. case in April, it accounted for 43% of cases by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that because of lower reporting levels, the agency has moved to longer reporting periods to track variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The viral level nationally is considered “moderate,” but that’s not true of 14 states that have much more viral activity. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html"&gt;CDC wastewater map&lt;/a&gt; shows high or very high viral activity levels in a number of states, including California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Texas, as well as Southern states. Many of the states surrounding those states have moderate viral levels in the wastewater. In Hawaii and Louisiana, the levels are very high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The good news is that fewer people are dying or being hospitalized compared to when COVID-19 was new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The bad news is the new strain is believed to be highly contagious, Dr. Albert Ko, professor of public health, epidemiology and medicine at Yale School of Public Health, told Today. He said both the earlier Nimbus variant and Stratus seem to be more transmissible than other variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Today article noted that “XFG also has several unique mutations in its spike protein, which have been shown to improve the virus’s ability to evade COVID-19 antibodies from prior infection or vaccination,” per the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Already-available vaccines are reportedly effective against Stratus in terms of preventing or reducing risk of severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Symptoms-of-Stratus" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Symptoms of Stratus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The virus’ symptoms are similar to other strains, though there are two anecdotal carveouts. While loss of taste or smell can occur, those are reportedly somewhat less likely with Stratus. And having a really, really sore throat and hoarseness have been reported to be more common with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The other, more standard symptoms of COVID also apply:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever or chills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathing challenges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congestion or a runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC says to get medical attention if you have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuing chest pain or pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Onset of confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inability to wake up or stay awake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signs of inadequate oxygen, including pale, gray or blue lips, nails and skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 18:22:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOYTA2R1dvR3d3NFgxaVc4b0p5NkVHYVlaUGRLNXBFSG1FWTBfS1JYYzEwcTFEWlVVZnZVSUtLbF93VjBOYU1Dc2R6ZVZWelJYakRXUGVSNTlHRG1YdUdHd1ctbi1yUkg3UHBjdHNtSnc3MUxpM0ljMzlhblI3bW8xemJmRm5FZ2w1TUE2cGwzSnZXQnIwclZZUE1qU1RlM1lpeE1oWVBRck9sWjBvN180V1dWRQ</guid></item><item><title>向ChatGPT询问如何从饮食中去除盐的男性因幻觉而住院- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxON2hlMlJYTThQakN2WjhHYWhXMjZqQlBwV3pMWENfLVd5NDZXUFVrVW9PQWpneHNmQ3Z4VlRaTFo0RHpZQjZ4QnMxTFd2U3BzVkxVRlhYMWJJekhRMWFsTVVsR0VyTG5FZ3ZjZWNuc2Zlb19heUxjRTV6aTJqMWNKMWVhSVEtaEhmcVdwU0JEdmczZlRfbEI4d2ZjUlE1ZEIwUmkyQ09NSXJmdE9WaEZUcXc4Q2FRX0pk0gFWQVVfeXFMTm5fMk5uNkg2dllTQnJfQlpKRmw1QmdZVkVSdnZpamtWVG0yQzhTaHl5TkM5SVpCOWJPOXZMS1luemd0R3JKYklTVFZ5cGdLZnR0ZnJZMkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6c0c8" class="body-graf"&gt;A 60-year-old man spent three weeks being treated at a hospital after replacing table salt with sodium bromide following consultation with the popular artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2ceb8" class="body-graf"&gt;Three physicians published a report on the case in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. According to the report, the man had no prior psychiatric history when he arrived at the hospital "expressing concern that his neighbor was poisoning him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cdd8d" class="body-graf"&gt;The man shared that he had been distilling his own water at home, and the report noted he seemed "paranoid" about water he was offered. Bromism, or high levels of bromide, was considered after a lab report and consultation with poison control, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84fa45" class="body-graf"&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the case report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64828e" class="body-graf"&gt;Once his condition improved, the man shared that he had taken it upon himself to conduct a "personal experiment" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. The report said he did this after consulting with the chatbot ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7510a9" class="body-graf"&gt;He self-reported that the replacement went on for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65ba4e" class="body-graf"&gt;The three physicians, all from the University of Washington, noted in the report that they did not have access to the patient's conversation logs with ChatGPT. However, they asked ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride could be replaced with on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ece40" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the report, the response they received included bromide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d1e3e" class="body-graf"&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a specific health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eea390" class="body-graf"&gt;A representative for OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning" target="_blank"&gt;noted in a statement to Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that its terms of service state that the bot is not to be used in the treatment of any health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4547cf" class="body-graf"&gt;"We have safety teams working on reducing risks and have trained our AI systems to encourage people to seek professional guidance," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-71ac42" class="body-graf"&gt;Bromide toxicity was a more common toxic syndrome in the early 1900s, the report said, as it was present in a number of over-the-counter medications and sedatives. It was believed to contribute to 8% of psychiatric admissions at the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7be7f7" class="body-graf"&gt;Bromide salt, an inorganic compound, is now typically only used in veterinary medicine as an anti-epileptic medication for cats and dogs, &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium-Bromide" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5fa6dc" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;It's a rare syndrome, but cases have re-emerged recently "as bromide-containing substances have become more readily available with widespread use of the internet," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 18:17:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxON2hlMlJYTThQakN2WjhHYWhXMjZqQlBwV3pMWENfLVd5NDZXUFVrVW9PQWpneHNmQ3Z4VlRaTFo0RHpZQjZ4QnMxTFd2U3BzVkxVRlhYMWJJekhRMWFsTVVsR0VyTG5FZ3ZjZWNuc2Zlb19heUxjRTV6aTJqMWNKMWVhSVEtaEhmcVdwU0JEdmczZlRfbEI4d2ZjUlE1ZEIwUmkyQ09NSXJmdE9WaEZUcXc4Q2FRX0pk0gFWQVVfeXFMTm5fMk5uNkg2dllTQnJfQlpKRmw1QmdZVkVSdnZpamtWVG0yQzhTaHl5TkM5SVpCOWJPOXZMS1luemd0R3JKYklTVFZ5cGdLZnR0ZnJZMkE</guid></item><item><title>新的血压指南建议跳过酒精和提前开始治疗- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1tT1NudFVZMWJOWnhER1FuXzd1eUdQNEVSb19vTmlvRGR0Z29qak54VXZ1Wk1xX3pJUVZGZkZ6U2FuaHdxdU5RNTJna1JuenZCODRPX3l1RUVXRXhyYWFjQXMyVHkyVXBwOGIwM0JfMGVjcXFuOG1Oc29GRjjSAYIBQVVfeXFMT0FRWWZKbTFwNWE4ZmlEczlFTFJYaGFGMEJqU1FTQ0dnQ0Vadjl5eUhMdW1wcDdOT1ZlbUctQkRyeWRBdmpQWUhaWW1ldGdlU2I5ZDNLSlZVZlVJU3gtd29sTTFuSENzN2tJZk1RYUdOejBVMjBoWTdLVHNSaktUVmdNUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The next time you get your blood pressure checked, expect your medical provider to be a bit more aggressive about high levels. And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0002336nc35tw52g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0003336n3sm61ync@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0004336n8wqazbc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0006336nj3ga9sti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0007336n3m2s99ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0009336nay35v8ul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000b336n6zd4xwrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblho37000x336nemo36zop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000c336nn2rdw7mx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000d336ns716xoqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000e336n8w37gpk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000f336nfuwtu7qx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000g336nt8wtyhrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" target="_blank"&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000h336njjhb09c7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000i336nsev8vtxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" target="_blank"&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000j336n9mtznh8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000k336nva3a7tyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there’s no reason to be spooked — the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00023b6n421d4p36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00033b6nd7z2zprb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies,” “demon rabbits,” and “zombie rabbits.” But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00043b6np7c97cmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00053b6ntqorepp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00063b6nb8w298so@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00073b6nx9vyuplb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00083b6ntt62tj09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she said that it’s not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00093b6njfhykyxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don’t harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits’ immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Last year, my husband’s 90-year-old grandmother was diagnosed with dementia. Within the last few months, she has experienced a drastic decline in her ability to recognize people. She was very close with our son, and he doesn’t understand why she can no longer remember who he is. Can you offer any advice on how to explain this to him?&lt;/p&gt;

You might start with something like: “Your grandma is sick with something called dementia—which is not the kind of sickness that will get better, like when you get a cold. Her dementia means that her brain doesn’t work in all the ways it used to. That’s why she is sometimes confused, or doesn’t always remember your name. But your grandma still loves us very much.”&lt;/p&gt;

Make sure he knows it’s okay to feel sad or worried or upset about the changes he sees in her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk5l68000i3b7azi2bmoul@published"&gt;I always found books to be quite helpful when introducing my kids to new concepts. If you’re not sure where to start, I’m sure the children’s librarian at your local library will be able to help. Here is one &lt;a href="https://pennmemorycenter.org/books-to-teach-children-about-ad-dementia/"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of suggestions I found (with the caveat that I haven’t read these books myself).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk5laz000j3b7a50w8s2xe@published"&gt;If his grandmother’s dementia worsens and she starts to behave differently as a result, you should talk about that with him, too, so he understands that it is her disease causing the changes. While he’s still so young, it might be worth trying to talk with him every time you’re planning to go visit her, whether there’s been a change or no—both so that you can remind him of the situation, and give him an opportunity to share what he’s feeling or ask you any new questions that may have occurred to him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7481000q3b7akmg47jeq@published"&gt;I’ve got a 14-year-old son and 9-year-old twin daughters. My son lives primarily with his mom, but has always spent plenty of time at my place, and the kids are all quite close. But there is a real problem with how he treats one of his sisters. The two of them share many traits and are quite similar in disposition, and when things are good, they have a very sweet relationship. They’ll go on walks together and chat and laugh the whole time. They also really enjoy play-fighting—e.g., hitting each other with foam swords. But at other times, my son will relentlessly pick at his sister, teasing her for things like not being as good at video games as he is, or questioning her abilities in other ways. It’s unkind, and although she sometimes claps back or does her best to ignore him, more often it sends her into a rage.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="217" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7482000r3b7ap5h7rpps@published"&gt;I’ve talked to him about it repeatedly (and yelled at him about it), and he has said he has trouble controlling himself. Maybe that sounds like a cop-out, but having observed it so many times, I believe him. It seems like an impulse-control thing, like the comments pop into his head and are out of his mouth before he can stop them. We have a good amount of neurodivergence in our family, and I strongly suspect that, like the sister in question, he’s got ADHD. I’ve wanted to get him assessed, but his mom—with whom I have a good relationship—is resistant, and he hasn’t had any issues in school yet that would offer more reason to push for it. I’ll tell him to knock it off and he’ll be chastened, but then 30 seconds later he’s picking on his sister again. What do you think I should be trying to do here? Yelling obviously isn’t the answer, and I can tell my son is feeling demoralized. I feel like this is about their similar personalities to some extent, because he doesn’t have the same issue with his other sister. But even if that’s the case, I want him to stop cutting his sister down, because she adores him and I’m pretty sure he actually adores her too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000u3b7apfuzuv39@published"&gt;You didn’t mention what you’ve tried in terms of establishing clear limits or disciplining your son, but it’s clear that just talking to or reasoning with him hasn’t done the trick, nor has the fact that his treatment of his sister is having a negative impact on his relationship with the sister he presumably cares for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000v3b7ay45w4no5@published"&gt;While I’m obviously not trying to diagnose him (plenty of neurotypical teens also have impulse control issues!), you shared that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; strongly suspect he has ADHD or some other type of neurodivergence, and I don’t think you should ignore that instinct. You mentioned that you haven’t pushed for an assessment for your son because he doesn’t appear to be struggling in school. But a kid can be doing fine academically and still need help in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000w3b7an0he1oqg@published"&gt;Even if his apparent impulse control issues are not affecting his grades, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; contributing to unkind and/or uncontrolled behavior and negatively affecting his relationships at home. You’re constantly frustrated with him; your daughter is hurt; if things go on like this or get worse, there could be more serious harm done to those relationships. And if your son is really “unable” to control himself, you are probably not the only ones who will have to deal with his behavior—at some point, if it’s not already happening, others will too.&lt;/p&gt;

I also understand that you’re co-parenting with his mom and the decision of exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to help him change his behavior isn’t up to you alone. But when you’re truly stuck, when you’ve tried everything you can think of as a parent and nothing is getting better, that’s when it’s time to seek out more information and professional advice. I think you and your son’s mother need to have a serious conversation about this, and how to get your son the support he may need to better control himself, because the current situation is making at least two of your children unhappy and seems unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk34es000s4mm9g1gk6edb@published"&gt;My sister asked me to be the legal guardian for each of her children (11F and 10M) when she was pregnant, and I agreed without hesitation. At the time, I was young (23 when the oldest was born) and single. I lived about an hour away from them and figured if I did need to step in as their guardian and I didn’t have my own family established in my area, I would move to them so that the kids’ entire lives wouldn’t need to be uprooted in the wake of their parents’ deaths. I’m a teacher in a high-demand subject, so the ability to find a new job in a slightly different area isn’t of concern. When I started going out with my now-husband five years ago, I made sure he was aware of my agreement with my sister and my intent to fulfill it, if needed. He had no issue with it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/10/sister-tragedy-agreement-husband-parenting-advice.html"&gt;Well, I’ve had to make good on the agreement, and my life is a disaster.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But in the case of HPV, there actually is a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/cancer-prevention-smoking-hpv-vaccination-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:public awareness remains low;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;public awareness remains low&lt;/a&gt;. Over one-third of American adults are unaware of HPV or the HPV vaccine, according to a new research letter published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2837650" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Oncology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, the numbers are significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why people need to know about HPV, the cancers linked to the virus, and the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, and she is the mother of two young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is HPV, and what cancers is it linked to? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; HPV is a virus that can infect humans. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over 100 types;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;over 100 types&lt;/a&gt; of HPV. Most HPV infections aren’t linked to cancer, but some are. The specific types of cancers associated with HPV infection are cervical cancer, cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis and anus. Some oral and throat cancers are also associated with HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the cancers linked to HPV, cervical cancer is the most common. Each year in the US, there are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13,000 new cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer. About 4,000 American women die of this cancer annually. However, as referenced in the new report, it’s not just cervical cancer — there are as many as 48,000 new cancer diagnoses linked annually to HPV. It’s important for people to understand the association between HPV and cervical cancer as well as the link to other cancer types, including the link to oropharyngeal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do people know if they have HPV — do they have symptoms at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of HPV cause warts. These tend to be what’s called low-risk HPV, meaning HPV that is not linked with cancer. Infections with high-risk HPV &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=Infection%20with%20high-risk%20HPV,cells%20may%20become%20cancer%20cells." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:do not cause symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;do not cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; at the time of infection; symptoms can develop later when precancerous and cancerous cells develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, HPV infection is very common — so common that nearly all sexually active people become infected with HPV within a few years of becoming sexually active. As much as half of HPV infections involve high-risk HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HPV infections are cleared by the body and do not result in cancer. However, some high-risk infections can persist. Over the course of many years, it can lead to the development of precancerous and then cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is HPV spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html#:~:text=HPV%20is%20most%20commonly%20spread,have%20no%20signs%20or%20symptoms." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most common;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; way for HPV to spread is through sexual intercourse. The virus can also spread during close skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s crucial to understand just how widespread HPV is and how high-risk HPV is spread by asymptomatic people. Condoms can lower the risk of spreading HPV, but because HPV can infect areas that condoms don’t cover, they don’t fully protect against HPV. This is why vaccination is so important, to protect against HPV-causing cancers down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How effective is the HPV vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The HPV vaccines have very high efficacy — close to 100% — for the prevention of cervical cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccines have also been found to have very high efficacy in men who have sex with men in preventing anal cancer. The vaccines also reduce the likelihood of developing genital warts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: When is the vaccine recommended to be given?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that preteens receive the first dose of the vaccine at age 11 or 12, though it can be given as early as age 9. For most people 9 through 14, a two-dose series is recommended, with the second shot given six to 12 months after the first. A three-dose series is recommended for people who begin vaccination at ages 15 through 45 and for immunocompromised individuals. The second shot is given one to two months after the first and the third about five months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Preteens should get the first dose of the HPV vaccine at 11 or 12, the CDC recommends. - John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: I have heard some parents say that they don’t want their children to get the shot because it may encourage them to have sex earlier. How do doctors and public health experts respond to that concern? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; They would point to the data. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2109856" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine compared over 21,000 vaccinated girls with nearly 186,000 unvaccinated peers and found &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;no evidence of increased unsafe sexual behavior.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593582/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found no association between HPV vaccination status and age of first sexual encounter or number of sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because high-risk HPV is so widespread, protecting against the cancers it can cause is essential. We are fortunate to have a vaccine that is so effective. Giving the vaccine is not about encouraging a particular behavior, but about giving protection in case someone becomes exposed to a virus someday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is your takeaway from this latest report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine remains dangerously low among the general public. In seven states, more than 40% of adults were not aware of HPV; in 13 states, more than 40% were unaware of the vaccine. In 45 states and Washington, DC, more than 60% did not know that HPV could cause oral cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that “there is a critical need to enhance HPV awareness among adolescents, young adults, parents or caregivers, and pediatric and adult health care professionals.” I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

The system began decoding users’ internal speech – the silent dialogue in people’s minds — only when they thought of a specific keyword. This ensured that the system did not accidentally translate sentences that users would rather keep to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt; on 14 August, represents a “technically impressive and meaningful step” towards developing BCI devices that accurately decode internal speech, says Sarah Wandelt, a neural engineer at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, who was not involved in the work. The password mechanism also offers a straightforward way to protect &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;users’ privacy, a crucial feature for real-world use&lt;/a&gt;, adds Wandelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding eavesdropping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCI systems translate brain signals into text or audio and have become promising tools for restoring speech in people with paralysis or limited muscle control. Most devices require users to try to speak out loud, which can be exhausting and uncomfortable. Last year, Wandelt and her colleagues developed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01424-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01424-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the first BCI for decoding internal speech&lt;/a&gt;, which relied on signals in the supramarginal gyrus, a brain region that plays a major part in speech and language&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A participant in a red T-shirt looks at a screen that is displaying the words 'If there is a decision to make, they speak first.'" loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;A study participant who has trouble speaking clearly because of a stroke uses the brain–computer interface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Emory BrainGate Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a risk that these internal-speech BCIs could accidentally decode sentences users never intended to utter, says Erin Kunz, a neural engineer at Stanford University in California. “We wanted to investigate this robustly,” says Kunz, who co-authored the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Kunz and her colleagues analysed brain signals collected by microelectrodes placed in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00078-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00078-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the motor cortex&lt;/a&gt; — the region involved in voluntary movements — of four participants. All four have trouble speaking, one because of a stroke and three because of motor neuron disease, a degeneration of the nerves that leads to loss of muscle control. The researchers instructed participants to either attempt to say a set of words or imagine saying them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings of the participants’ brain activity showed that attempted and internal speech originated in the same brain region and generated similar neural signals, but those associated with internal speech were weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01001-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51086678.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain implant translates thoughts to speech in an instant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Kunz and her colleagues used this data to train artificial intelligence models to recognize phonemes, the smallest units of speech, in the neural recordings. The team used language models to stitch these phonemes together to form words and sentences in real time, drawn from a vocabulary of 125,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device correctly interpreted 74% of sentences imagined by two participants who were instructed to think of specific phrases. This level of accuracy is similar to that of the team’s earlier BCI for attempted speech, says Kunz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The first identified a promising starting point by searching through a library of millions of chemical fragments, eight to 19 atoms in size, and built from there. The second gave the AI free rein from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The design process also weeded out anything that looked too similar to current antibiotics. It also tried to ensure they were inventing medicines rather than soap and to filter out anything predicted to be toxic to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists used AI to create antibiotics for gonorrhoea and MRSA, a type of bacteria that lives harmlessly on the skin but can cause a serious infection if it enters the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Once manufactured, the leading designs were tested on bacteria in the lab and on infected mice, resulting in two new potential drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="MIT Prof Collins is leading on his laboratory bench, wearing a burgundy shirt, with an array of pieces of scientific equipment out of focus in the background." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Prof James Collins, one of the researchers at MIT&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're excited because we show that generative AI can be used to design completely new antibiotics," Prof James Collins, from MIT, tells the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"AI can enable us to come up with molecules, cheaply and quickly and in this way, expand our arsenal, and really give us a leg up in the battle of our wits against the genes of superbugs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, they are not ready for clinical trials and the drugs will require refinement – estimated to take another one to two year's work – before the long process of testing them in people could begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Andrew Edwards, from the Fleming Initiative and Imperial College London, said the work was "very significant" with "enormous potential" because it "demonstrates a novel approach to identifying new antibiotics".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he added: "While AI promises to dramatically improve drug discovery and development, we still need to do the hard yards when it comes to testing safety and efficacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That can be a long and expensive process with no guarantee that the experimental medicines will be prescribed to patients at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some are calling for AI drug discovery more broadly to improve. Prof Collins says "we need better models" that move beyond how well the drugs perform in the laboratory to ones that are a better predictor of their effectiveness in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is also an issue with how challenging the AI-designs are to manufacture. Of the top 80 gonorrhoea treatments designed in theory, only two were synthesised to create medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Chris Dowson, at the University of Warwick, said the study was "cool" and showed AI was a "significant step forward as a tool for antibiotic discovery to mitigate against the emergence of resistance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he explains, there is also an economic problem factoring into drug-resistant infections - "how do you make drugs that have no commercial value?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If a new antibiotic was invented, then ideally you would use it as little as possible to preserve its effectiveness, making it hard for anyone to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAzbUZpMWRobi1sUGg0WkhUNnI0WXJ2Sl9VdFdpUkxWcjBsdDBmUnNQWnpWSUF0T0tUVVh1dk82TEJNX0g3eklJWk9xOUZpM3NmdTYxaXNwclcwUdIBX0FVX3lxTE82NUhkZGdLWHFiV2FRX1JTd1ZHazhzNXplOFQyYnJfTUxEUFk5M1ppNTZzNmg0MUgzSy1DeldQelFJNmI1MEJ2NnFqM04tSU9JVURDTjJVMkQ5MG9wRF9n</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，在科罗拉多州生长角状疣的“恶魔”兔子并不危险--《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTUlmb1dUTjE0VkdtdU85R01uUnhUclNvSE5vUllnaWhFU3hneU8xYnQwNjAySkpNTmlDNXpoeWQ5WTA5T3RHdzNTOE5UUEhzNDlOb2JKTXZOa2tvTElFWGR6MDdYWlUwU3k0bXhTQ01oSnA1VVRnUGNUemxuU25TVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A group of rabbits in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there is no reason to be spooked – the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/colorado","type":"Keyword","title":"Colorado"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/west-coast","type":"Keyword","title":"West Coast"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","type":"Keyword","title":"Wildlife"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"science/infectiousdiseases","type":"Keyword","title":"Infectious diseases"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/west-coast-news","type":"Tracking","title":"West Coast News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/aug/14/rabbits-horn-warts-colorado","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies”, “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits”. But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus probably influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr Richard E Shope, a professor at the Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105km) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; parks and wildlife, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency had been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she said that it was not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths do not harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits’ immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTUlmb1dUTjE0VkdtdU85R01uUnhUclNvSE5vUllnaWhFU3hneU8xYnQwNjAySkpNTmlDNXpoeWQ5WTA5T3RHdzNTOE5UUEhzNDlOb2JKTXZOa2tvTElFWGR6MDdYWlUwU3k0bXhTQ01oSnA1VVRnUGNUemxuU25TVQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家开发能够解码内部语音的大脑植入物-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complete digital access to quality analysis and expert insights, complemented with our award-winning Weekend Print edition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ</guid></item><item><title>您需要了解的关于抗癌HPV疫苗的信息- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBzQWdUM2NPdG9NdmVDLVF1V1NYTGlncmtiVzZDUms1VGR0QzJtejNxdXZCcUlWOS1lNnNtcGhzR1hwNWp4ZzhDZ3BXakU0Zkh4b2FPUFNtWHp6VERXdTA1RXBwYTVPNjJwVzNfT3dRX09yaFRRSUlpSUpjX0RyNVnSAYQBQVVfeXFMUGk1YWt1bFNNQmlnczRvSTZFMjdlTjhyS2d3QkxoMlliNml2Y00tWlRGaXJsVXRBeVp3MGlHcmRFSzJFRTN0c2l1UTM3T01ZNjdrMFVYLUVlZ05Hd0Z4SXhVMTNmMXl3d0VSb0tUaEhfRnR6U1B6RmdNU0lqYzRnT1ptbmEz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Imagine if there were a vaccine for breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer or any of the most well-known cancers that sicken and kill so many people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00023b6ni46ccaeq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every year, there are an estimated 48,000 new cases of cancers associated with the human papillomavirus, or HPV, in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/publications/hpv-associated-cancers.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. But in the case of HPV, there actually is a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00033b6nihfqabaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/cancer-prevention-smoking-hpv-vaccination-wellness"&gt;public awareness remains low&lt;/a&gt;. Over one-third of American adults are unaware of HPV or the HPV vaccine, according to a new research letter published Thursday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2837650" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, the numbers are significantly higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00043b6n231ksah8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why people need to know about HPV, the cancers linked to the virus, and the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00053b6nn7wjf22i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, and she is the mother of two young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00063b6n6zmqtugo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is HPV, and what cancers is it linked to? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00073b6n29o13nc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; HPV is a virus that can infect humans. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank"&gt;over 100 types&lt;/a&gt; of HPV. Most HPV infections aren’t linked to cancer, but some are. The specific types of cancers associated with HPV infection are cervical cancer, cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis and anus. Some oral and throat cancers are also associated with HPV infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00083b6niz3pu3hc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the cancers linked to HPV, cervical cancer is the most common. Each year in the US, there are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;13,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer. About 4,000 American women die of this cancer annually. However, as referenced in the new report, it’s not just cervical cancer — there are as many as 48,000 new cancer diagnoses linked annually to HPV. It’s important for people to understand the association between HPV and cervical cancer as well as the link to other cancer types, including the link to oropharyngeal cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do people know if they have HPV — do they have symptoms at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of HPV cause warts. These tend to be what’s called low-risk HPV, meaning HPV that is not linked with cancer. Infections with high-risk HPV &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=Infection%20with%20high-risk%20HPV,cells%20may%20become%20cancer%20cells." target="_blank"&gt;do not cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; at the time of infection; symptoms can develop later when precancerous and cancerous cells develop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000b3b6n2zpoaf1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, HPV infection is very common — so common that nearly all sexually active people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;become infected with HPV within a few years of becoming sexually active. As much as half of HPV infections involve high-risk HPV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000c3b6nkwr3k2vf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most HPV infections are cleared by the body and do not result in cancer. However, some high-risk infections can persist. Over the course of many years, it can lead to the development of precancerous and then cancerous cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is HPV spread?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html#:~:text=HPV%20is%20most%20commonly%20spread,have%20no%20signs%20or%20symptoms." target="_blank"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; way for HPV to spread is through sexual intercourse. The virus can also spread during close skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000f3b6nd7wx69ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s crucial to understand just how widespread HPV is and how high-risk HPV is spread by asymptomatic people. Condoms can lower the risk of spreading HPV, but because HPV can infect areas that condoms don’t cover, they don’t fully protect against HPV. This is why vaccination is so important, to protect against HPV-causing cancers down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000g3b6ng92ih8oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The HPV vaccines have very high efficacy — close to 100% — for the prevention of cervical cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccines have also been found to have very high efficacy in men who have sex with men in preventing anal cancer. The vaccines also reduce the likelihood of developing genital warts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000i3b6ndflqdt1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000j3b6n23gqfa3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that preteens receive the first dose of the vaccine at age 11 or 12, though it can be given as early as age 9. For most people 9 through 14, a two-dose series is recommended, with the second shot given six&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to 12 months after the first. A three-dose series is recommended for people who begin vaccination at ages 15 through 45 and for immunocompromised individuals. The second shot is given one to two months after the first and the third about five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;months later.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000k3b6nwpd81413@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I have heard some parents say that they don’t want their children to get the shot because it may encourage them to have sex earlier. How do doctors and public health experts respond to that concern? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000l3b6n3dkpm22u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; They would point to the data. A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2109856" target="_blank"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published in the journal&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine compared over 21,000 vaccinated girls with nearly 186,000 unvaccinated peers and found &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;no evidence of increased unsafe sexual behavior.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593582/" target="_blank"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have found no association between HPV vaccination status and age of first sexual encounter or number of sexual partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000m3b6nzp3svi53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because high-risk HPV is so widespread, protecting against the cancers it can cause is essential. We are fortunate to have a vaccine that is so effective. Giving the vaccine is not about encouraging a particular behavior, but about giving protection in case someone becomes exposed to a virus someday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine remains dangerously low among the general public. In seven states, more than 40% of adults were not aware of HPV; in 13 states, more than 40% were unaware of the vaccine. In 45 states and Washington, DC, more than 60% did not know that HPV could cause oral cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The authors concluded that “there is a critical need to enhance HPV awareness among adolescents, young adults, parents or caregivers, and pediatric and adult health care professionals.” I agree.

            &lt;p&gt;With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have designed novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; and multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus &lt;/em&gt;(MRSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using generative AI algorithms, the research team designed more than 36 million possible compounds and computationally screened them for antimicrobial properties. The top candidates they discovered are structurally distinct from any existing antibiotics, and they appear to work by novel mechanisms that disrupt bacterial cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed the researchers to generate and evaluate theoretical compounds that have never been seen before — a strategy that they now hope to apply to identify and design compounds with activity against other species of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited about the new possibilities that this project opens up for antibiotics development. Our work shows the power of AI from a drug design standpoint, and enables us to exploit much larger chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible,” says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins is the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00855-4" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are MIT postdoc Aarti Krishnan, former postdoc Melis Anahtar ’08, and Jacqueline Valeri PhD ’23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring chemical space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 45 years, a few dozen new antibiotics have been approved by the FDA, but most of these are variants of existing antibiotics. At the same time, bacterial resistance to many of these drugs has been growing. Globally, it is estimated that drug-resistant bacterial infections cause nearly 5 million deaths per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of finding new antibiotics to fight this growing problem, Collins and others at MIT’s &lt;a href="https://www.audaciousproject.org/grantees/collins-lab" target="_blank"&gt;Antibiotics-AI Project&lt;/a&gt; have harnessed the power of AI to screen huge libraries of existing chemical compounds. This work has yielded several promising drug candidates, including &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220" target="_blank"&gt;halicin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/using-ai-scientists-combat-drug-resistant-infections-0525" target="_blank"&gt;abaucin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build on that progress, Collins and his colleagues decided to expand their search into molecules that can’t be found in any chemical libraries. By using AI to generate hypothetically possible molecules that don’t exist or haven’t been discovered, they realized that it should be possible to explore a much greater diversity of potential drug compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers employed two different approaches: First, they directed generative AI algorithms to design molecules based on a specific chemical fragment that showed antimicrobial activity, and second, they let the algorithms freely generate molecules, without having to include a specific fragment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fragment-based approach, the researchers sought to identify molecules that could kill &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;, a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gonorrhea. They began by assembling a library of about 45 million known chemical fragments, consisting of all possible combinations of 11 atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and sulfur, along with fragments from Enamine’s REadily AccessibLe (REAL) space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they screened the library using machine-learning models that Collins’ lab has previously trained to predict antibacterial activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This resulted in nearly 4 million fragments. They narrowed down that pool by removing any fragments predicted to be cytotoxic to human cells, displayed chemical liabilities, and were known to be similar to existing antibiotics. This left them with about 1 million candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get rid of anything that would look like an existing antibiotic, to help address the antimicrobial resistance crisis in a fundamentally different way. By venturing into underexplored areas of chemical space, our goal was to uncover novel mechanisms of action,” Krishnan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through several rounds of additional experiments and computational analysis, the researchers identified a fragment they called F1 that appeared to have promising activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. They used this fragment as the basis for generating additional compounds, using two different generative AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those algorithms, known as chemically reasonable mutations (CReM), works by starting with a particular molecule containing F1 and then generating new molecules by adding, replacing, or deleting atoms and chemical groups. The second algorithm, F-VAE (fragment-based variational autoencoder), takes a chemical fragment and builds it into a complete molecule. It does so by learning patterns of how fragments are commonly modified, based on its pretraining on more than 1 million molecules from the ChEMBL database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two algorithms generated about 7 million candidates containing F1, which the researchers then computationally screened for activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This screen yielded about 1,000 compounds, and the researchers selected 80 of those to see if they could be produced by chemical synthesis vendors. Only two of these could be synthesized, and one of them, named NG1, was very effective at killing &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; in a lab dish and in a mouse model of drug-resistant gonorrhea infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional experiments revealed that NG1 interacts with a protein called LptA, a novel drug target involved in the synthesis of the bacterial outer membrane. It appears that the drug works by interfering with membrane synthesis, which is fatal to cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconstrained design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second round of studies, the researchers explored the potential of using generative AI to freely design molecules, using Gram-positive bacteria, &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; as their target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the researchers used CReM and VAE to generate molecules, but this time with no constraints other than the general rules of how atoms can join to form chemically plausible molecules. Together, the models generated more than 29 million compounds. The researchers then applied the same filters that they did to the &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; candidates, but focusing on &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;, eventually narrowing the pool down to about 90 compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were able to synthesize and test 22 of these molecules, and six of them showed strong antibacterial activity against multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;grown in a lab dish. They also found that the top candidate, named DN1, was able to clear a methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) skin infection in a mouse model. These molecules also appear to interfere with bacterial cell membranes, but with broader effects not limited to interaction with one specific protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phare Bio, a nonprofit that is also part of the Antibiotics-AI Project, is now working on further modifying NG1 and DN1 to make them suitable for additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a collaboration with Phare Bio, we are exploring analogs, as well as working on advancing the best candidates preclinically, through medicinal chemistry work,” Collins says. “We are also excited about applying the platforms that Aarti and the team have developed toward other bacterial pathogens of interest, notably &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the National Institutes of Health, the Audacious Project, Flu Lab, the Sea Grape Foundation, Rosamund Zander and Hansjorg Wyss for the Wyss Foundation, and an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All cases detected in Hawaii so far have been in people who traveled to regions where dengue is more common, so the agency warned people returning from endemic areas contact their doctor if they develop symptoms within two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquitoes carrying the dengue virus are usually found in tropical and subtropical regions like Central and South America, Africa, South Asia and the Pacific Islands.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, dengue is most prevalent in Florida, Texas and California, as well as the territory Puerto Rico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to CDC data, Puerto Rico has reported the most dengue cases at 2,152 so far this year. Florida has seen 115 cases while California has seen 62. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease spreads through mosquito bites and cannot be transmitted from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 400million people get dengue fever every year but eight in 10 don't develop any symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who do usually experience a high fever, blotchy rash, muscle aches, joint pain and pain behind the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in rare and severe cases, the condition can cause vomiting or throwing up blood, intense joint pain and trouble breathing. These issues may further cause internal bleeding, leading to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirteen percent of patients die from the disease if they do not receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dengue is a potentially deadly virus passed to people by infected mosquitoes and was historically known as 'break-bone fever'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Emma Cox, 27, is one of those to report suffering from dengue fever. She had traveled to Indonesia, but 10 days after returning to the UK, she developed symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no antiviral for dengue fever, but the World Health Organization says that by rapidly replacing lost fluids the mortality rate drops to less than one percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A vaccine for dengue is available and approved by the FDA for children aged nine to 16 years old, but its manufacturer, French pharma giant Sanofi Pasteur, has discontinued production globally, citing a lack of demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doses are available in Puerto Rico, but these are expected to run out by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dengue cases have surged in Latin America, thought to be linked to the El Nino weather cycle at that time - which brings more heavy rains to areas of the continent - leading to more standing water in which mosquitoes can multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, rising temperatures have allowed mosquitoes to be active for longer each year and advance further north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In areas of the world where outbreaks are not as common, upticks are being linked in part to travel, leading to people who become infected abroad to enter the US then get bitten by a mosquito, which passes the virus to the insect and allows it to take root in the local mosquito population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC urges Americans traveling to high-risk areas to carry insect repellent, wear long sleeves and long pants outside and sleep in air-conditioned rooms or those with window screens to prevent being bitten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 14:14:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSHFzbUlYYTdDUVVxVGpkeUpPUjN6WWh0a1RBLU5UMkFIVFBBMV9ueWc1bUFOV2xqeDc3S3hJWS1WMVB3VmJQclFjeWZlUDN3aHh3RHdDNVBrUURhdVFPX2hYeUhwRGNKUG5fZUdTZDJNMjlSQkU0RHNWekZsLXp4REYwZWt4cjNZWkY0RllzZHR0WWFGT3dIbWpUQ1M0d3pkMHlPamc5aHkyMVHSAbABQVVfeXFMUFlvaThteExabUlSRVF5YVpfalZtUXRuZUg5VDloMFBqMUdleVhrTEdOeDdoQmtLUTk5VWlPWEpIN0RHejFIRFpnY2hYTEJ5ME9KdGcweGdQUmtJMFpIaXd3THdtYmpiVmpuVVJoX2NfMTdBTnItakRlS1NSOENUbXJTeGllV0o4V3M3bUE2RzlxWFhOXzNibFE5UE5qRk9YTUlkVVJUd3RGUko3dllaVXY</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.正在疫苗开发方面取得重大进展—这可能会危及我们所有人- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQN3ZPSkg2aEZRSUtXVWl0RnN5eFVsQ0lIZFFWYmlqaWRWU28tVkVMT29vNWlfSlhYSmFvcnR2VmxVdEVBd2IzWk5zN205TEtTWXh3UmEzZlJ1QTY0dHBfSm9LN2s5Wm1VZTJ0MU54WGRPWU5Fa2xQYlhlNV9DR3Utd3JEM1VFSnQ5YllLM3dseHM3aktCOExCRWM3b9IBoAFBVV95cUxQXzkzMXN0d3hjZklwWVlKd2JQVUZCd19zVldWTG80bzBqcnFZWHFEcmRGQ29lQW9KNW9PV1ZxcmJYWkl3Q0tIejFFT3REZkpnZ3FOZzl0RnU4dmk0QUxIY3F5N2NXOVRLNHBIVlBLRE5XWHNhb3JVbXZCYm5XV1Qta1N3UHN6N1Z4ck9UdVlzTTRadWwzY1phdHByYmZtZkxu?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/author/robert-f-kennedy-jr" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Robert F.

As it spread, scientists in the United States researched how to make an mRNA vaccine for coronavirus in case it was needed (no vaccine was made or needed since it didn’t impact the U.S.), Offit explained. So, when SARS-CoV-2 came around in 2020, scientists had previous research to work from when developing a COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Kennedy’s $500 million funding cuts to BARDA, “you lose a lot of that research development so that when the next pandemic comes in ... you won’t have that information.

And I think that this dims the light,” Offit noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take time for projects to move overseas, said Tran, which will delay mRNA advancements. This could be deadly for folks with conditions that could benefit from these emerging treatments, Tran added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, if there is a time when we need mRNA technology from another country, we’ll be “shopping in the yellow pages,” said Mukkamala, and asking other countries what technology they have that we could use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s just not good as a leading country when it comes to research on this planet,” added Mukkamala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’ll hurt the economy and cause job loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond health impacts, these funding cuts will likely mean job loss, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those grants that were canceled were paying for research positions, and maybe some of those people will find new jobs, but some of them might not be able to, because that money is gone,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s going to be an economic factor to these funding cuts, she noted — “because not only is this money being used to further scientific progress and improve human health, but it’s also creating jobs and fueling local economies, and any type of cut is going to have impact on the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much impacting the economy right now, like &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-tariffs-china_n_689a8838e4b08fd59b6441a5" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Donald Trump’s tariffs" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899fff5e4b0c2e59a931a05" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="689a8838e4b08fd59b6441a5" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="19"&gt;Donald Trump’s tariffs&lt;/a&gt; and more, it’s hard for folks to understand that these science funding cuts also have a big economic impact, Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are things you can do to advocate for science funding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to sit back and watch as this scary reality unfolds.

Officials said the person was most likely exposed to it while at a beach on Buzzards Bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ca6e9" class="body-graf"&gt;"Vibrio bacteria normally live in warm, salt or brackish waters along the Atlantic coast," Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. "Heat waves and above-average water surface temperatures create favorable conditions for Vibrio&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bacteria to grow, making May through October generally the peak season for these bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-275d08" class="body-graf"&gt;About a dozen species of Vibrio can cause illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

			&lt;p&gt;Ozempic and drugs like it have done wonders for weight loss by mimicking the natural hormone GLP-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;), which helps control blood sugar and appetite. Now a new study shows how gut microbe byproducts could have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteroendocrine_cell"&gt;Enteroendocrine cells&lt;/a&gt; (EECs) in the gut are responsible for producing natural GLP-1, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MED.0000000000000709"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a reduced number of EECs and lower GLP-1 production could be helping to drive obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using tests on rats and mini-guts grown in the lab (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organoid"&gt;known as organoids&lt;/a&gt;), researchers from Marshall University in the US have now confirmed a link between fewer EECs and obesity – and found a way to get the gut to make up the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-like-drugs-could-treat-chronic-migraines-trial-finds"&gt;Ozempic-Like Drugs Could Treat Chronic Migraines, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This points to a potential therapeutic strategy that leverages the gut microbes to improve metabolic outcomes in obesity," &lt;a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/news/musom-news/new-research-uncovers-gut-microbe-derived-metabolites-as-potential-therapy-for-obesity-related-metabolic-disorders/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Alip Borthakur of the Department of Clinical &amp;amp; Translational Sciences at Marshall University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers turned to supplements of the amino acid tryptophan to fix the EEC problem. Tryptophan was already known to promote &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.05.003"&gt;good gut health&lt;/a&gt;, in part through a metabolite (or biological byproduct) called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole"&gt;indole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170257" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/IndoleGraph.jpg" alt="Indole graph" class="wp-image-170257 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/IndoleGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/IndoleGraph-600x365.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170257" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Extra indole led to the gut signal changes the researchers expected. (Hart et al., &lt;em&gt;Int. J. Mol. Sci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the team was able to show in their work was that tryptophan and indole could form a production line to generate new EECs, and from there, more GLP-1. In other words, it promoted a more natural way of getting the same effect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/promising-new-drug-for-weight-loss-works-with-just-one-monthly-dose"&gt;as a dose of Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tryptophan is found in foods such as poultry, eggs, cheese, and certain seeds, and the thinking is that dietary supplements or probiotics of some kind could be used to drop the amino acid into the gut and start the necessary chemical chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that microbial metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan can reverse obesity-associated reductions in hormone-secreting gut cells," &lt;a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/news/musom-news/new-research-uncovers-gut-microbe-derived-metabolites-as-potential-therapy-for-obesity-related-metabolic-disorders/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Borthakur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to identify a specific cell receptor, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"&gt;aryl hydrocarbon receptor&lt;/a&gt; (AhR), through which this process occurs. That gives researchers a particular target to aim at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual treatments are still a long way off, but these initial findings are promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic is one of a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor antagonists, used to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170253" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/staggering-results-of-new-weight-loss-drugs-may-be-revolutionary-expert-says"&gt;as well as obesity&lt;/a&gt;. However, these treatments do come with side effects, and it would be preferable for our bodies to produce GLP-1 more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's part of the motivation for studies like this. In recent years, other teams of scientists have identified ways to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-may-have-found-a-natural-alternative-to-ozempic"&gt;tweak gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-drug-free-way-to-mimic-the-effects-of-ozempic"&gt;adapt our diets&lt;/a&gt; to try and boost GLP-1 production in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the next steps will be to move these experiments out of rats and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="170253" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt; and into actual human beings. While the lab tests carried out here do of course provide useful pointers for researchers, the processes and reactions inside people could vary &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-vital-fat-burning-protein-that-could-aid-weight-loss"&gt;in certain ways&lt;/a&gt; – which further studies can look into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The molecular players and signaling pathways involved in the regulation of EEC differentiation could be different in the normal and obese conditions," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26157080"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26157080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: How much vitamin B12 should I take as a diabetic? -- T.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LAX2VYERH5EIJK5WELTC4T4HSU"&gt;ANSWER: Many people have strong feelings that vitamin B12 can dramatically improve their health, but it only helps to take vitamin B12 if you are deficient. Vitamin B12 deficiency isn’t too common. Still, there are a few situations where supplemental vitamin B12 should be considered, and two of them are specific for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZEMMBWGZZBDSTLGZOC46BFMATI"&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes, which usually presents itself during childhood, are at a high risk for other autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia -- an autoimmune destruction of the cells in the stomach that make a protein called intrinsic factor. This protein is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Multiple autoimmune diseases are often diagnosed in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JYOWZBLRCFAZ7GX7OP43YBONMY"&gt;People with Type 2 diabetes who take metformin are at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency due to poor absorption. I recommend testing vitamin B12 in people who have been on metformin for a long time. Proton-pump inhibitors (like omeprazole) may also reduce B12 absorption to the point of deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y43JPAUPGBEYXPBKM4OTSFKXDI"&gt;People who are very strict with avoiding any type of animal products will develop B12 deficiency over the years unless they use supplements. Finally, people who can’t absorb nutrients for a variety of reasons (such as bariatric surgery, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, fish tapeworm, and disease of the pancreas) may all become B12-deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TNLAO5XYOZDVNBKL3IRB7GYIPA"&gt;Treatment of B12 deficiency depends on the underlying cause. For example, a vegan only needs about 1 mcg a day to avoid B12 deficiency. By contrast, people with pernicious anemia need 1,000 times the usual oral dose of B12 or B12 injections. Measuring B12 levels to ensure adequate supplementation is wise in people who have difficulty absorbing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2IIQNS6YVBGVFC2NWZUXMW3EXY"&gt;For healthy people (apart from the above and a few other rare conditions) with a non-vegan diet, it is not necessary to supplement B12, nor is testing necessary. B12 toxicity is essentially unheard of since the body simply excretes the B12 that you don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3LBKJCRUNFGXHAJBAOS3W66NP4"&gt;Apart from severe absorption problems like pernicious anemia, the dosing of B12 supplementation is the same whether a person has diabetes or not. Fifty micrograms a day is almost always more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: Is the Naltrexone shot (for alcohol abstinence) more effective when given on one side of the body compared to the other? A person I know who receives the shots feels that it’s only effective when they receive it on their right buttock. Is this possible, or could they be noticing a placebo effect? -- C.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YCZJBPUAZNATFJ45U44VC3RNV4"&gt;ANSWER: Naltrexone is an effective treatment for people with alcohol dependence. The exact effectiveness depends on the setting, but people who use naltrexone are less likely to relapse on their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="632CJTWBHJDRHBK2BWEEKJS3CQ"&gt;Of course the drug will be absorbed just as well from the left side as the right. However, our expectations can have a huge influence on the effectiveness of a treatment. When there is an expectation of benefit, there is a placebo effect. (When there is an expectation of harm, it’s called a nocebo effect.) The placebo effect isn’t as critical in a situation like antibiotics for pneumonia but can be of immense importance when the desired effect is a decrease in alcohol cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TXN6GPXJBREYJHMZA7CHW4L73U"&gt;If I were this person’s doctor, I would keep giving the injection on their right side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4KNOMLENLBHFVE5NFCPPTXG6OE"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

He called on the journal to “immediately retract” the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see no reason for retraction,” Dr Christine Laine, editor in chief of the Annals of Internal Medicine and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The journal plans to respond to criticism the article has received on its website, Laine said, but it does not intend to respond directly to Kennedy’s piece, which was not submitted to the journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, Anders Peter Hviid, head of the epidemiology research department at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, defended the work in a response post to TrialSite. He wrote that none of the critiques put forward by Kennedy were substantive and he categorically denied any deceit as implied by the secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I am used to controversy around vaccine safety studies – especially those that relate to autism, but I have not been targeted by a political figurehead in this way before,” Hviid said in an emailed response to Reuters. “I have confidence in our work and in our ability to reply to the critiques of our study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy had a number of criticisms, including the lack of a control group, that the study deliberately excluded different groups of children to avoid showing a link between aluminum and childhood health conditions – including those with the highest levels of exposure – and that it did not include the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hviid responded to the criticisms on TrialSite. He said some of the points were related to study design choices that were reasonable to discuss but refuted others, including that the study was designed not to find a link. In fact, he said, its design was based on a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180331/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study led by Matthew Daley&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, which did show a link, and which Kennedy cited in his article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was no control group because in Denmark only 2% of children were unvaccinated, which was too small for meaningful comparison, Hviid added. The data was available for researchers to analyze, but individual-level data was not released under Danish law, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other prominent vaccine skeptics including those at the antivaccine organization Kennedy previously ran, Children’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Defense, have similarly criticized the study on the Annals of Internal Medicine site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;TrialSite staff defended the study for its scale, data transparency and funding while acknowledging the limitations of its design, a view seconded by some outside scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Laine said that while some of the issues Kennedy raised in his article may underscore acceptable limitations of the study, “they do not invalidate what they found, and there’s no evidence of scientific misconduct”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department had “no further comment than what the secretary said”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQYllINkJWN2FTaXRtOWtSNTBuZ0ViRWRUYnp0MVhXbnhINVZ6bUhPUUlZTWRkM0xMWFJ0SV9xdnNjQXZWelFBY2FHbjM4ZkRkdlhBcFREc3d0V3l2RWw5UzltVzJ0eDI1OTBBbVJ1WTRWajlpTGZFeHdkZkJBYU9KMGNBTWQ1UElrMWNTaERtQktiNmxZ</guid></item><item><title>两种致命癌症的新疫苗在临床试验中显示出前景- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNOWRnWm9PWFE2c0ZKdVlNTHNGRTl3OXVyd1JRa29vNVpOcGpVNUNmZml5SEotckd0TWFNb19GaFBQLVBXWlhKOVZBX0FMNUdZZnZMRXl3ZVFFaFJrWHQySzctSzE2NjVuNHlTT0ZNUk5jNGRWTTZGN3NmOUc1RV80Q21SMU9YSXlrcDdaRXhDc1puWGZ4WFk4aXNvZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

For cancers this aggressive, those are all impressive statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We observed that patients who developed strong immune responses to the vaccine remained disease-free and survived for much longer than expected," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wainberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the people who participated in the study, there was a median relapse-free survival of 16.33 months and a median overall survival of 28.94 months, both way beyond what's normally expected &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-prognosis"&gt;in cancers like these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these results even better is that ELI-002 2P is what's known as an 'off-the-shelf' vaccine, which means it's a standard treatment that doesn't need to be personalized for each person (a process which takes time and expertise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional trials and testing will be necessary to fully evaluate the risks and benefits, but considering the high recurrence and mortality rates of pancreatic and colorectal cancers, there's strong evidence here that this vaccine could add years of health to people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also saw positive signs of the vaccine training the immune system to fight other types of cancer mutations too, so there's the potential for it to be even more useful in efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;improve treatments&lt;/a&gt; going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting KRAS has long been considered one of the difficult challenges in cancer therapy," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wainberg. "This study shows that the ELI-002 2P vaccine can safely and effectively train the immune system to recognize and fight cancer-driving mutations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It offers a promising approach to generating precise and durable immune responses without the complexity or cost of fully personalized vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03876-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Amid uncertainty at the federal level, the Globe spoke with experts to guide readers on which vaccines are available, what doctors are recommending, and where to find reliable sources of information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Though the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has yet to officially weigh in on the COVID-19 vaccine,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Kennedy&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;announced on X&lt;/a&gt; in May that the CDC would no longer recommend the shots for healthy children or healthy pregnant women. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-age.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC &lt;/a&gt;immunization schedule still recommends COVID-19 vaccinations for adults, it &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;updated its website &lt;/a&gt;to state that parents of children ages 6 months to 17 years “should discuss the benefits of vaccination with a healthcare provider.” Under the pregnancy category, the CDC lists “no guidance/not applicable” for COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is also weighing whether to revoke its &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/12/lifestyle/covid-young-children-pfizer/?utm_campaign=Globe_Facebook&amp;amp;s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/12/lifestyle/covid-young-children-pfizer/?utm_campaign=Globe_Facebook&amp;amp;s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook"&gt;authorization of Pfizer’s vaccine &lt;/a&gt;for healthy children under age 5. If the FDA follows through, healthy children in this age range may be left without an officially authorized option, since Moderna’s vaccine is approved only for children with underlying health conditions, and Novavax’s vaccine is not available to those under 12.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics continues to recommend that all children starting at six months receive the COVID vaccine, even if they’re healthy, Anders Pring said. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/03-Havers-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, 41 percent of children ages 6 months to 17 years hospitalized with COVID-19 from October 2022 to April 2024 did not have a known underlying condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Anders Pring recommends every child starting at age six months receive the “primary series,” the two initial doses. For older children, Anders Pring recommends getting an annual booster, just like the flu shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Naima Joseph, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Boston Medical Center, recommends pregnant patients also receive the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Insurance companies are mandated to cover ACIP’s recommendations. But since the panel’s final recommendation has not been released, insurance companies have promised to accept the guidance from medical societies, Joseph said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/articles/health-plans-continued-commitment-to-vaccine-access" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;America’s Health Insurance Plans&lt;/a&gt;, a national trade association representing the health insurance industry, stated in June that it is “committed to ongoing coverage of vaccines to ensure access and affordability for this respiratory virus season.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are hopeful that given AHIP has stated an intent to continue coverage of vaccines, it won’t be a problem,” Joseph said. “We will continue to partner with clinicians, pharmacists, community health workers to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The CDC still recommends the flu vaccine for everyone six months and older. But, in late June, Kennedy approved the CDC advisory committee’s recommendation to &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;avoid thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; in flu vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thimerosal, a mercury-based chemical compound, is used like a preservative in multi-dose vials. The ingredient has long been pushed by the anti-vaccine movement as being connected to autism, though that &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/04/metro/vaccines-autism-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/04/metro/vaccines-autism-rfk-jr/"&gt;data was debunked&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The move should not affect the supply of flu vaccines, doctors said, as thimerosal is used in less than 5 percent of U.S. flu vaccinations. Manufacturers &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32711/HHS-approves-flu-vaccines-without-thimerosal" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;told the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;/a&gt;and The Globe that the decision should not impact their capacity to provide vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Boston Medical Center is “proactive in looking at supply chains throughout the year to ensure that we have sufficient stock,” said Cassandra Pierre,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;an infectious disease physician there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus, which causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract, primarily infects young children under 2 years old. It also impacts the elderly, especially those with weakened immune systems and chronic lung conditions. RSV infections are &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv#:~:text=Respiratory%20syncytial%20virus%20(RSV)%20infects,causes%20160%2C000%20deaths%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;usually mild&lt;/a&gt; in healthy people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As of Aug. 4, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommends RSV vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for all adults ages 75 and older, as well as adults ages 50 to 74 who are at increased risk for severe RSV. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In June, the federal panel approved a recommendation for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;clesrovimab&lt;/a&gt;, an antibody that prevents RSV, for infants under 8 months. There is no preferential recommendation between this antibody and another called nirsevimab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For pregnant women, the CDC recommends a single dose of the maternal RSV vaccine — in particular, Pfizer’s Abrysvo — during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy. The RSV vaccine given to mothers allows antibodies to be passed to the baby before birth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doctors agree that RSV vaccines are recommended for these populations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Pneumonia vaccines are available throughout the year, Pierre said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; pneumococcal vaccination for children younger than 5 and adults 50 and older. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It also recommends it for individuals who have underlying health conditions that put them at high risk for severe disease. That includes people with HIV, asthma or significant pulmonary disease, or diabetes, according to Pierre.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h2 id="where_can_i_find_reliable_information_about" class="heading | font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile margin_bottom
            "&gt;Where can I find reliable information about vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Pierre said guidance from professional organizations, like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, are resources to look to. She added state and local boards for public health are “wonderful unsung gems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Minnesota announced in July that it is teaming up with medical professional organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and American Academy of Family Physicians “to support the development of evidence-based guidance for flu, COVID and RSV immunization,” according to a press release. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While such resources exist, doctors ultimately urged patients to consult with their own clinicians. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From a public health perspective, we as pediatricians love to talk with our patients and work with them,” Anders Pring said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile
