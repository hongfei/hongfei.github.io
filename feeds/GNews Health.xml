						&lt;p&gt;A North Raleigh park once plagued with mosquitoes lurking along
a shaded tree line saw a bite-free summer after testing new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In years past, we would get nonstop complaints of ‘I’ve got
mosquitoes along the walking path,’” said Tanner Hardee, who has overseen landscaping
at Cokesbury Park for several years with the company Yardnique. “This year, we haven’t
gotten a single one.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eight Biogents traps, camouflaged along the park’s tree line
are responsible for the reduction in bites.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The German-based company -- with a U.S. base in Cary -- installed
the traps three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve effectively caught over a million mosquitos,” said
Biogents USA President John Anderson. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The females caught by the traps alone are estimated to
reduce future mosquito population around the park by over 7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The devices use pesticide-free technology. They lure mosquitoes with a small attractant that’s chemically engineered to mimic the scent of a human. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/family/no-mosquito-park-eco-friendly-traps-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“There is a specific design to the traps,” Anderson
explained. “They push out airflow – it’s a circular air flow – and it has CO2 attached
to it. The airflow pattern is what mimics a human.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The airflow pulls the mosquitoes inside the trap, and they
cannot escape.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anderson shared the cone-shaped traps used in the parks only
attract mosquitoes, leaving other important pollinators and wildlife unharmed.
Smaller circular traps are also available for at-home use, and they don’t require professional
maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In the rest of the world, insecticides are banned more so
than the U.S.,” Anderson told WRAL. “In the rest of the world, Biogents has
been doing this for 20 years. What we want to do is take that here in the
United States and show people there is a better way to do this than just
fogging or insecticide spraying.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The traps may also offer homeowners cost savings. Terminix
Triad reports &lt;a href="https://www.terminix-triad.com/our-blog/how-much-does-pest-control-cost-north-carolina/#:~:text=Ongoing%20pest%20control%20plans.,automatic%20charges%20after%20each%20service."&gt;ongoing
pest control plans&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina range from $300-$1,600 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/family/no-mosquito-park-eco-friendly-traps-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Biogents at-home traps and attractants sold on Amazon
are listed for less than $300. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Beyond comfort, experts say the approach could have public
health implications. Trapped mosquitoes in Biogents devices can be analyzed to
determine whether they carry viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The company has worked internationally to mitigate the
spread of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue fever, in places like Asia,
Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In July, Durham reported &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/07/30/ncdhhs-announces-first-west-nile-case-2025"&gt;North
Carolina’s first case of West Nile virus in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mosquitoes were also
detected in Pitt County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Local homeowners Victoria Blacik and Clinton Adams told WRAL
they have noticed fewer pests along the park’s walkway.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We walk through most evenings,” Blacik said. “I haven’t
been bitten by mosquitoes that I can remember walking through here recently, so
it’s doing its job.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She added, “Sometimes people do mosquito-spraying in their yard,
and I know that works, but it’s pesticides. It’s nice they found a solution
that doesn’t involve pesticides like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Adams said the couple was “completely oblivious” to the
traps because they were so quiet and hidden in the trees. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Biogents said the summer success at Cokesbury Park has helped
fuel a plan with NCDHHS to roll the tech out to more public spaces statewide. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We met with them last week,” Anderson said. “We’re
looking at how do we implement this into almost 40 counties here in North
Carolina for next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;The governors of Arizona, Illinois, Maine and North Carolina on Friday joined the growing list of Democratic officials who have signed orders intended to ensure most residents can receive COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies without individual prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike past years, access to COVID-19 vaccines has become complicated in 2025, largely because &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-19-vaccine-insurance-coverage-pharmacists-16b166a86548b37849eff2debc6e6100"&gt;federal guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; does not recommend them for nearly everyone this year as it had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at where things stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Pharmacy chain says the shots are available in most states without individual prescriptions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, the biggest pharmacy chain in the U.S., says its stores are offering the shots without an individual prescription in 41 states as of midday Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the remaining states — Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah and West Virginia, plus the District of Columbia — require individual prescriptions under the company’s interpretation of state policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona, Maine and North Carolina are likely to come off that list as the new orders take effect there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will not stand idly by while the Trump Administration makes it harder for Maine people to get a vaccine that protects their health and could very well save their life,” Maine Gov. Janet Mills said in the statement. “Through this standing order, we are stepping up to knock down the barriers the Trump Administration is putting in the way of the health and welfare of Maine people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Democratic governors have been taking action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 14 states — 12 with Democratic governors, plus Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin is governor — have announced policies this month to ease access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some of the states that have expanded access — including Delaware and New Jersey earlier in the week and Illinois on Friday — at least some pharmacies were already providing the shots broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday’s orders are expected to change the policy in all three states where they were put into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina’s orders were narrower than most. They apply to everyone age 65 and over and people who are at least 18 and have a risk factor. Other adults would still need prescriptions. Officials said the order takes effect immediately, but that all pharmacies might not have supplies on hand right away.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;While most Republican-controlled states have not changed vaccine policy this month, the inoculations are still available there under existing policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the round of orders from governors, boards of pharmacy and other officials, four states — California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington — have announced an alliance to make their own &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-west-coast-vaccines-trump-fd5ce557532a3c9f37b77ff9f14b07b9"&gt;vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Of those, only Oregon doesn’t currently allow the shots in pharmacies without individual prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccines have become politically contentious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past years, the federal government has recommended the vaccines to all Americans above the age of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved them for people age 65 and over but said they should be used only for children and younger adults who have a risk factor such as asthma or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That change came as U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in June, accusing of them of being too closely aligned with the companies that make the vaccines. The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replacements include vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, framed her order Friday as “protecting the health care freedom” of people in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;One state has taken another stance on vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida’s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, announced this month that the state could become the first to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-vaccine-mandates-desantis-schools-health-38688345e8d2cac6ecc6e92f3babe0f8"&gt;eliminate requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that children have a list of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, though, the state health department said that the change likely &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-vaccine-mandates-children-4e697db6085dc5dd4bd9b206ed9a51b6"&gt;wouldn’t take effect until December&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and that without legislative action, only some vaccines — including for chickenpox — would become optional. The measles and polio shots would remain mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press writer Patrick Whittle in Maine contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Greenblatt, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) Chief Medical Officer and State Health Director, has now issued &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/about-us/nc-state-health-director-standing-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Standing Orders&lt;/a&gt; that allow seniors 65 years or older and adults over 18 years who meet certain criteria to get a COVID-19 vaccine at a pharmacy without having to get a prescription from a provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Health care providers and pharmacists recommend vaccination as a safe and effective tool to protect yourself and your community from COVID-19,” &lt;strong&gt;said Governor Josh Stein. &lt;/strong&gt;“This action ensures that North Carolinians most at risk who want protection from COVID-19 can get it as we enter the cold and flu season.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Requiring an office visit to obtain a prescription to receive the COVID-19 vaccine is an administrative barrier for patients, providers, and pharmacies,” &lt;strong&gt;said Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai.&lt;/strong&gt; “Vaccinations against seasonal respiratory viruses, including flu, RSV, and COVID are especially important and the right choice for those at higher risk of severe viral respiratory disease.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, North Carolina had more than 120,000 emergency department visits for COVID-like illness, resulting in more than 21,600 hospitalizations. Vaccines remain an important part of overall health and well-being and are one of the most effective means available to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death. They help protect the health of children and adults, their families, and entire communities from the spread of infectious diseases. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines in late August, and the Standing Order aligns with those federal recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per state law, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina are permitted to administer vaccines that the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends, but the committee has not yet given its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines this season. Without ACIP recommendations, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina may only administer COVID-19 vaccines for those ages 18 and up with a prescription. With the Standing Order, adults over age 65 or with increased risk for severe COVID-19 can get the COVID-19 vaccine at a local pharmacy without having to visit a health care provider first. The Standing Order will serve as a prescription for immunizing pharmacists to administer COVID-19 vaccines to adults for whom the FDA has already approved the vaccine. For children ages six months to 17 years, parents should talk to their pediatricians, family physicians, or health care providers about vaccine availability. The Standing Order will increase access to care for millions of people in North Carolina who want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. According to NCDHHS, more than 70% of COVID-19 doses in North Carolina were given at pharmacies last year, showing those facilities are an important point of access for those who want the COVID-19 vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The North Carolina Retail Merchants Association supports allowing North Carolinians 18 and older who choose to receive a COVID vaccine to get it at their local pharmacy without a prescription in accordance with recently issued FDA guidelines. We also applaud the decision to let patients continue to choose receiving both flu and COVID vaccines at their local pharmacies, underscoring the vital role pharmacies play in community healthcare. This order reduces confusion and brings North Carolina in line with the policies in place in the overwhelmingly majority of other states.”&lt;strong&gt; - Andy Ellen, NCRMA President and General Counsel &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are the most effective public health tool to prevent the spread of a broad range of contagious illnesses including COVID-19. The NCAFP supports the Governor’s efforts to ensure safe and appropriate access to COVID-19 vaccines, be it from a physician or a pharmacist. We must all work together to protect our communities against the spread of COVID-19 infection.” &lt;strong&gt;- Dr. Mark McNeill, MD, FAAFP, President of the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important steps taken today by the Governor and Dr. Greenblatt will save lives by improving access to vaccines.” &lt;strong&gt;– Dr. John Meier, MD, President of the North Carolina Medical Society &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Old North State Medical Society strongly endorses Governor Stein’s vaccination order. It fully aligns with our mission to promote health equity for the most vulnerable communities in North Carolina. Easier access for patients and reduced administrative obstacles for providers will make more vaccinations possible for underserved populations who face geographic, economic, or transportation challenges in obtaining preventive care.” &lt;strong&gt;– Dr. Wesley Ibazebo, MD, President of the Old North State Medical Society &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Internal medicine physicians across North Carolina applaud the action of our state public health leaders and Governor Stein to increase the ability for our most vulnerable adult patients to receive the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine in their neighborhood pharmacies. By removing access barriers to this crucial vaccine, we are facilitating the health of our patients and our communities.” &lt;strong&gt;- Dr. Marion M. McCrary, MD, FACP, FAMWA, Governor, American College of Physicians North Carolina chapter &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is currently one of &lt;a href="https://commonhealthcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-2026-COVID-19-Vaccine-Availability-by-State.pdfhttps://commonhealthcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-2026-COVID-19-Vaccine-Availability-by-State.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;10 states&lt;/a&gt; where, without ACIP recommendations, immunizing pharmacists can give the COVID-19 vaccine to people of certain age groups only if they have a prescription. The Standing Order aligns North Carolina with the vast majority of states where people do not need a prescription to get the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Order will align with the FDA’s Aug. 27, 2025, approval indicating the COVID-19 vaccine for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All people 65 years of age and older. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals 18 and older who have at least one high-risk condition. This is a broad list that includes high-risk conditions such as obesity, asthma, diabetes, physical inactivity, depression, former or current smoking, and pregnancy, among many other conditions.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you think you may be eligible, you can view the list of risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most pharmacies already have the updated 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine available, but since the seasonal vaccine formulations were recently approved by FDA, it may not yet be available at all locations. People should call their pharmacy of choice to see if they have COVID-19 vaccines available and make an appointment if needed. You should bring your insurance card if you have one and be prepared to answer a few simple questions, like how old you are or whether you have a qualifying condition. NCDHHS is continuing to work with partners to maximize the availability of COVID-19 vaccines for individuals who want the vaccine and would benefit from its protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the following retail pharmacies have announced they have the updated COVID-19 vaccine available: Brisson Drugs, Carlie C’s, Central Pharmacy of Durham, Costco, CVS Pharmacy, Food Lion, Hope Mills Pharmacy Fairmont Drug Company, Ingles Markets, Med Smart Pharmacy, Med Source Pharmacy, Publix Pharmacies, Sam’s Club, Walgreens, and Walmart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This a partial list of pharmacies available to provide COVID vaccines. If you do not see your pharmacy’s name on this list, please reach out to confirm they are administering vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP recommendations are expected later in September, and federal guidance may continue to evolve. As this happens, North Carolina will do everything it can to ensure people have access to safe and affordable COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals, including parents, should talk with their health care provider or their child’s health care provider about the benefits and any concerns regarding seasonal vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. NCDHHS also has a &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/immunization/providers/education-and-resources/for-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;bilingual childhood vaccinations toolkit&lt;/a&gt; in English and Spanish for providers to help individuals, parents, and providers have conversations about the importance of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Limited access and required funding are the key challenges facing health officials trying to respond to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-kasai-outbreak-73c01a467e3f7b5e3e19abec17c65a39"&gt;the latest Ebola outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in southern Congo, the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/world-health-organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo with poor road networks, which is more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the nation’s capital of Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A United Nations peacekeeping helicopter was used to help deliver 400 vaccine doses to the epicenter, in the locality of Bulape, on Friday, Patrick Otim, WHO’s program area manager, said at a briefing in Geneva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional 1,500 doses will be sent from the capital of Kinshasa, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have struggled in the last seven days with access but are collaborating with MONUSCO (U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo) now,” Otim said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;While the WHO and Congolese authorities have “ramped up efforts to have a full scale response” on the ground, “we need to be able to pay for the operations,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the outbreak was confirmed on Sept. 4, the number of suspected cases has &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-kasai-outbreak-b4dfd340373d2f5e4ce2ce40b1eba6e0"&gt;increased from 28 to 68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Africa’s top health agency said on Thursday. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Africa CDC, has so far reported 16 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otim said the most recent confirmed case was located 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the current epicenter. “Our worry is if we get cases in the other health zone, we need to expand and it will be resource-intensive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;WHO’s projected cost for the current outbreak over the next three months is $20 million while Congo’s national response plan is estimated at $78 million, said Otim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major concern has been the impact of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16"&gt;recent U.S. funding cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The U.S. had supported the response to Congo’s past Ebola outbreaks, including in 2021 when the U.S. Agency for International Development provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Health workers at risk, to be prioritized in vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least four health workers are among the confirmed cases, according to Mathias Mossoko, Congo’s Ebola response coordinator in Bulape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For now, our priority is to vaccinate health care workers. Given the number of cases and deaths among health care providers, protecting these front line workers is essential to ensure the population receives adequate care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 94% of the suspected cases’ contacts — more than 600 people — have been traced with only one so far confirmed to be infected, Mossoko said, adding that there’s minimal risk of the disease spreading to other provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this stage, it is not yet appropriate to declare a public health emergency,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asadu reported from Dakar, Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Janet Mills, that would help expand access to COVID-19 vaccines in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUGUSTA, Maine — The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a standing order Friday that will "serve as a prescription for all Maine people" in an effort to expand access to COVID-19 vaccines in the state. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standing order comes under the direction of Gov. Janet Mills. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It authorizes qualified health professionals, including pharmacists, to administer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine, according to a joint statement announcing the order. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Under the standing order, Maine people no longer need to obtain a prescription through their health care provider to receive the vaccine," the release states. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mills earlier this week said that she would be looking to find ways to improve access to the vaccines in Maine following actions by Trump administration that led to multiple restrictions for who would be eligible to receive them. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Arnold is a legislative liaison of the Maine Pharmacy Association and serves as vice president of operations at Community Pharmacies of Maine. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold spoke with NEWS CENTER Maine about the standing order and spoke favorably about the efforts to improve access to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think that the Maine CDC and the governor's office really took some thoughtful and thorough steps when reviewing this, so it's a very comprehensive guide that they released," Arnold said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think that what the state of Maine released today releases a strong message that they are taking the steps here to protect public health, no matter what kind of activity we have on the federal level," she continued. "I really applaud them for that and making that statement and working with all Mainers."  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is developing and may be updated as information becomes available. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Why do people experience it, and what can be done to mitigate it? Additionally, what is executive function? We asked experts to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-executive-function" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is executive function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Executive function&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the ability to manage and organize tasks on a daily basis, says Mai Uchida, a pediatric psychiatrist at Massachusetts general hospital and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. This includes planning, prioritizing and thinking about how long a task will take you before you need to move on to the next thing. But it also includes the ability to break down larger tasks into smaller ones, being able to shift attention from one task to another, and maintaining working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-executive-dysfunction" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is executive dysfunction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Executive dysfunction”, on the other hand, is not really a term used by mental health professionals. You’re much more likely to hear a professional say that a person “has difficulties with executive functioning” or “has poor executive function”, says Kristin Carothers, a clinical psychologist based in Atlanta and New York. These professionals don’t want to label anyone as “dysfunctional”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="793456c2-6b40-4e7b-9dd4-1d532bba1770" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The unconscious process that leads to creativity: how ‘incubation’ works","elementId":"793456c2-6b40-4e7b-9dd4-1d532bba1770","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/sep/10/creativity-unconscious-process-incubation"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the idea of executive dysfunction does get at a real experience that some people live with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The obvious hallmarks of poor executive function include difficulty initiating tasks, missing or running up against deadlines, being late, and losing things. But it can also include patterns such as poor impulse control and overspending, difficulties in following through on promises, and overestimating your ability to follow through on commitments, says Carothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critically, “poor executive function” and “executive dysfunction” are not diagnoses, says Uchida. You cannot be diagnosed with either of these terms, but poor executive function could be a symptom that accompanies a genuine psychiatric condition. Most often, poor executive function is associated with ADHD, she says, though “there are plenty of people with ADHD who don’t have executive functioning difficulties”. It has no relationship to intelligence. Executive functioning difficulties can also accompany anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-has-a-negative-effect-on-executive-function" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has a negative effect on executive function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Like most other human traits, executive function exists on a spectrum. “It’s on a bell curve, where most people are somewhere in the middle,” says Ari Tuckman, a clinical psychologist in Westchester, Pennsylvania. Executive function can also change over your lifetime. For example, “adults have better executive function than kids”, he says. It can decline a bit as a consequence of normal ageing, and those going through menopause will also likely see a greater degree of change as a side-effect of hormonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Life circumstances can also affect executive function. “If you have a bad night’s sleep or if you have the flu”, your executive function will take a hit, Tuckman says. Bouts of depression or anxiety, stress, intoxication, head injuries and being busier than usual are also influential factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you normally don’t struggle with executive function but are having trouble because of temporary life circumstances – such as getting poor sleep, or being busier than usual – things should return to normal afterward. But if you have chronic, persistent trouble with managing daily tasks, to the point that it’s affecting your personal and professional life, that might be a sign that there’s an underlying issue, and you might want to see a professional, says Carothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many are tried and true organizational strategies, says Tuckman: “You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.” For example, set up multiple reminders and alarms for yourself, and write out on paper checklists of things to do, even for tasks that are extremely small and easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Reflect on and try to recognize the patterns that get you into trouble. If you have a work deadline approaching, and you know you tend to lose track of time when you open up and scroll through Instagram, try temporarily removing the app from your phone. Essentially, avoid putting yourself into situations that require more impulse control than you are able to muster, says Tuckman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you get overwhelmed by the size of a task and have trouble getting started, Uchida recommends finding a small amount of time you can commit to. Maybe that’s 15 minutes; maybe it’s just five. Then dedicate just that small amount of time to the task. “When the bar is low, it’s a lot easier to get started,” says Uchida, “and sometimes it’s just getting started that’s difficult.” You might find that after that first 15 minutes, you have the ability to keep going. Or you might need a break before you commit to another 15. You have to find and adapt strategies that work for you, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Carothers also recommends turning to community to help you understand where you might need assistance. “Sometimes other people have more insight into your behavioral patterns than you do,” she says. “Ask a trusted friend, colleague, romantic partner for areas where they’ve noticed you struggle.” Then ask them to help you brainstorm workarounds for those specific circumstances – they might have ideas that you never learned or considered. “Strong social connections are important,” Carothers says. “Learn from the people around you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 16:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOMDZxVmtsQ2ZpNVpuYzhncmdxMVVxWkFRUVoyZ042ckdMYnkwbEFLTTMyT1V0VWxvVnZpa19rS25ITmZtRFFJOE9OV0JhSFVBSkdDODVfcjM2UUtwaFNHZEl4OHhld0tRcVQ2RWVTZXY3NEtpSE9ZMWdTenRmenJya1QtLUtkUQ</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的CDC和RPI将研究自闭症与疫苗之间已被证实的联系- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/09/12/cdc-autism-research-contract-vaccines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 16:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1ROUNMekNvbzlRMVFKNFlsZEdRRDJGVmlDSjE3TGhzN28yRHNWM2VlRWN5SEdoZHFMNXd4TFoyOGhuNlFURTE4UERiRlhac0o5OG50ajY0anFQVHJyaWtZeUxuTDNrQ00ybnZnaU00dGhYUkJZSWVGSXln</guid></item><item><title>植物中设计的新途径让它们吸收更多的二氧化碳- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/new-pathway-engineered-into-plants-lets-them-suck-up-more-co%E2%82%82/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;And, well, it worked remarkably well. The plants carrying all the genes for the McG cycle weighed two to three times as much as control plants that only had some of the genes. They had more leaves, the leaves themselves were larger, and the plants produced more seeds. In a variety of growing conditions, the plants with an intact McG cycle incorporated more carbon, and they did so without increasing their water uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a two-carbon output also worked as expected. By feeding the plants radioactive bicarbonate, they were able to trace the carbon showing up in the expected molecules. And imaging confirmed that the plants were making so many lipids that their cells formed internal pockets containing nothing but fatty materials. Triglyceride levels increased by factors of 100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by a variety of measures, the plants actually did better with an extra pathway for fixing carbon. There are a number of cautions, though. For starters, it's not clear whether what we're learning using a small weed will also apply to larger plants or crops, or really anything much beyond &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; at the moment. It could be that having excess globs of fat floating around the cell has consequences for something like a tree. Plants grown in a lab also tend to be provided with a nutrient-rich soil, and it's not clear whether all of this would apply to a range of real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can't say whether all the excess carbon these plants are sucking in from the atmosphere would end up being sequestered in any useful sense. It could be that all the fat would just get oxidized as soon as the plant dies. That said, there are a lot of approaches to making biofuel that rely on modifying the fats found in plants or algae. It's possible that this can eventually help make biofuels efficient so they actually have a net positive effect on the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of practical impacts, however, it's pretty amazing that we've now reached the point where we can fundamentally rewire a bit of metabolism that has been in operation for billions of years without completely messing up plants.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;h1&gt;Acupuncture treatment improves disabling effects of chronic low back pain in older adults&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH-funded study supports acupuncture needling as a safe and effective pain treatment for this group.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;According to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), older Americans with chronic low back pain who received acupuncture had greater improvement in physical function and reduced pain than those who received usual medical care only, generally prescribed medications or physical therapy. Chronic low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects over one-third of older adults in the United States. Treatment options range from pain-relieving drugs to complementary therapies, including &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-effectiveness-and-safety"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;. There is an urgent need for safe, effective, and non-addictive pain management approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of the different treatments we have for chronic low back pain, most have a somewhat modest effect. They often reduce pain by about a third at best and can help people function better,” said lead author Lynn L. DeBar, Ph.D., Kaiser Permanente distinguished investigator. “Our clinical results suggests that acupuncture is working as well as many things that are more familiar to people. We found that the size of this effect, while modest, was positive and sustained.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial, known as BackInAction, enrolled 800 participants, with results based upon self-reported pain-related disability assessments following treatment that either included or omitted acupuncture. Researchers looked at whether manual acupuncture needling, which is eligible for Medicare coverage, could improve function and reduce pain for older adults who have chronic or persistent low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture, with its origins in traditional East Asian medicine, has gained in popularity in the United States since the 1970s. The manual acupuncture needling technique entails inserting fine needles into the skin at points that follow a prescribed anatomical grid. The practice provides various benefits, including reduced discomfort from back, joint or neck pain. While acupuncture has been found to be safe and effective for chronic low back pain in adults overall, few acupuncture studies have focused on adults 65 years of age and older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in BackInAction included men and women aged 65 and older with a medical history of low back pain for at least three months. All participants had health coverage and were not restricted from receiving usual medical care for their back pain. A third of those received up to 15 acupuncture treatments over three months (standard acupuncture treatment), and another third received an additional six acupuncture treatments (maintenance sessions) over the following three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At three study milestones — after three, six and 12 months from enrollment — participants provided self-assessment of their pain and physical limitations. Their agreement with any of 24 statements that describe everyday activities made difficult because of back pain contributed to the participant’s disability score. The researchers used additional tools for insights into pain levels, degree of physical functioning, depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the six-month and 12-month assessment, both groups who received acupuncture had greater reductions in pain disability than those who received usual medical care alone. The acupuncture-treated groups also had reduced pain intensity and greater physical function after six months as compared to participants who did not receive acupuncture. The researchers also reported that acupuncture treatment was associated with fewer anxiety symptoms as compared to usual medical care alone at the six and 12-month assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What sets the BackInAction study apart is that it focused specifically on adults 65 years of age and older, and it was pragmatically designed,” DeBar said. “We worked hard to involve adults in multiple regions of the country so that participant demographics were consistent with the U.S. census for older adults—and we worked with licensed acupuncturists in the community, who are most likely to deliver these services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study authors suggest that access to acupuncture is important for older adults with chronic back pain and that if acupuncture practitioners could bill Medicare directly it could greatly improve access to such services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We saw very little in the way of adverse effects during the clinical trial,” said co-lead researcher Andrea J. Cook, Ph.D., Kaiser Permanente senior biostatistics investigator. “Older adults often are dealing with other medical problems in addition to back pain. Acupuncture offers a less invasive option that has a better safety profile than a lot of the common treatments for back pain in older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;

                In 2022, a sign in Miami, Fla., promotes "monkeypox vaccination." That same year the World Health Organization changed the name of the virus to "mpox" since the animals that transmit it to humans are rodents and small mammals, not monkeys, and because of the stigma carried by the term "monkey."

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the medical establishment and public health world nixed the name "monkeypox" for two key reasons. Animal-to-human transmission comes from rodents. And the name "monkeypox" was seen as racist and stigmatizing language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To replace it, World Health Organization (WHO) officials decided to call the disease that causes painful lesions "&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/11/28/1139403803/who-renames-monkeypox-as-mpox-citing-racist-stigma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mpox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, the U.S. is reverting to the old term "monkeypox."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first question is: 'Why?' It doesn't make any sense," says &lt;a href="https://infectiousdiseases.wustl.edu/people/joseph-nabile-cherabie-md/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Joseph Cherabie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Washington University in St Louis. He cares for mpox patients and, back in 2022, pushed for the term "monkeypox" to be retired.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; echoed that sentiment. "This reversion is just very baffling to me," she says. "No one in the research community is clamoring for this. No one in the public health community is clamoring for this." Titanji is an infectious disease physician and mpox researcher at Emory University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to an email from NPR asking about a change in the terminology, the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) sent this statement: "Monkeypox is the name of the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That would be inaccurate," says &lt;a href="https://globalohc.org/public-profile/11" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Daniel Bausch&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the Geneva Graduate Institute and infectious disease expert. "They either are misinformed and they're not aware that it's switched to mpox, or they are not willing to accept the recommendations from [World Health Organization] and the committee that assigns disease names."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/cdc-changes-monkeypox-terminology-to-mpox.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adopted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the WHO's change to mpox. The HHS spokesperson did not respond to requests for clarification about why HHS was using the old term or when it started doing that. The change goes back to at least Aug. 28, 2025 when the State Department used the term "monkeypox" in an email to NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While there's no official announcement — or explanation — from the U.S. about the switch, mpox experts have guesses — and, they say, this is part of a much longer history of debating what to call diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was it called "monkeypox" in the first place? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus was first discovered in 1958 in Denmark in a group of monkeys that were kept in a lab for research. That's how the term monkey was attached to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the first human case of mpox was discovered in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, researchers tried to figure out if the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/08/g-s1-26474/smallpox-mpox-virus-outbreak-vaccine-public-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;young boy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who was sick had any contact with monkeys. It wasn't until later that they realized the virus was, in fact, not jumping from monkeys to humans. Instead, they know believe that the virus comes from contact with small mammals and rodents in the forest in central and west Africa, like squirrels that are hunted for food. It then spreads between humans through close contact and sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But the name monkeypox stuck until 2022 when the virus took off globally. According to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mpox" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it spread suddenly and rapidly to over 100 countries and primarily impacted gay men.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was at that point that there was a concerted push to change the name. Titanji understands firsthand why.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the name change? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2022 as the outbreak was unfolding and spreading, Titanji would post the latest medical information on her Twitter account, now called X.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She was shocked by the messages she started receiving.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Because I am a black woman, the name monkeypox was co-opted to direct vitriol toward me," Titanji remembers. "Some of the [messages] were likening me to a monkey, [some were] asking me to go back to Africa where the disease comes from and where people have sex with monkeys, and [some messages were about me] being someone who defends gay sex with monkeys. Those were some of the really, really dark direct messages that I got in my inbox during that time."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The term "monkey" has a long history of being used as a racist and dehumanizing slur against Black people. Cherabie says the name also played into problematic narratives that associate the LGBTQ community with bestiality since the name prompted false assumptions that people got the virus by having sex with monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2022, patients, health care workers and others urged the WHO to rename the disease. During that summer, New York City's then Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasa sent&lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/press/2022/advocacy-letter-monkeypox-name-who-07262022.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; a letter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to WHO asking them to quickly rename monkeypox, citing "potentially devastating and stigmatizing effects."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In November of that year, WHO announced the new name for the diseases and a transition period of one year. (While WHO names diseases, the underlying virus is named by the &lt;a href="https://talk.ictvonline.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and has not changed from &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/taxonomy/taxondetails?taxnode_id=202404771&amp;amp;taxon_name=Orthopoxvirus%20monkeypox#release_40" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;orthopoxvirus monkeypox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bausch says part of the reason is for historical consistency in medical research terminology.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji says the change was welcomed by patients and the scientific community. "It shifted the focus from what I would call a distraction — in terms of an easy name to troll — and really brought the focus to the problem at hand," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This is far from the first time a disease name has raised concerns about stigmatizing groups of people or geographic areas. In February of 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/11/802352351/new-coronavirus-gets-an-official-name-from-the-world-health-organization" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO gave COVID-19&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a name, replacing the informal name many had adopted based on the city where it first emerged in China: "Wuhan virus."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did the U.S. revert to "monkeypox"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the Health and Human Services did not provide an explanation for the shift, Cherabie, the Washington University professor, says it feels like it fits into a pattern. "It just falls in line with the playbook of this administration to go back to controversial terms," he says. "This is a simple provocation."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This is not the only case of a potentially problematic designation. WHO &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/163636/WHO_HSE_FOS_15.1_eng.pdf;jsessionid=1A52572D066F031228EE8713301C028E?sequence=1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 discourage disease names that refer to specific places, people and professions, to avoid stigmatizing them. However, these guidelines are not followed in all cases. Some diseases — such as Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS — continue to be named after places and people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are many, many viruses and diseases that really were given the wrong name," says Bausch, who is also a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore. "We'd have to change Ebola and Sudan virus and Marburg virus [which are named after a river, country and city] and lots of other things, but I don't think there's a huge appetite for doing that because of the confusion that it would create."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, he warned that if the U.S. is indeed reverting to the term "monkeypox" after a successful global transition to mpox that itself could create confusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[It must be] more of a political motivation for this to be happening," Bausch says, "If there's a significant body of people who feel offended by something, you know, why not listen to them?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His sense is that the Trump administration might have considered the original name change "a woke thing" and that it might be part of the Trump administration's tense relationship with the World Health Organization. Trump announced he'd be pulling the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/20/g-s1-42918/trump-world-health-organization-withdrawal" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;out of WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on inauguration night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Asked about the U.S. return to the term "monkeypox," with its implications, the media team for WHO did not address the change but referred NPR to articles on the original name change in 2022 and their 2015 guidelines of naming diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For her part, Titanji says she'll be sticking with the term mpox.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The finding points to changes in small blood vessels that help feed and clean brain tissue, which is hard to detect during life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those lesions are called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hyaline-arteriolosclerosis"&gt;hyaline arteriolosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, a thickening of tiny arteries that narrows the passage for blood and stresses nearby cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process sits within vascular cognitive impairment as described in an American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/str.0b013e3182299496"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, which outlines how damaged vessels relate to thinking problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alcohol-and-brain-health"&gt;Alcohol and brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/679852/alberto-fernando-oliveira-justo/"&gt;Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of Sao Paulo Medical School in Brazil (&lt;a href="https://www.fm.usp.br/fmusp/portal/"&gt;FMUSP&lt;/a&gt;) led the work. His team used human brains rather than only scans, which lets them count lesions directly and measure brain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heavy alcohol consumption is a major &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drunk-decisions-alcohol-affects-men-and-women-differently/"&gt;global health concern&lt;/a&gt; linked to increased health problems and death,” said Alberto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project analyzed older adults who agreed to donate their organs for research, creating a window into aging and alcohol exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, one &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/what-standard-drink"&gt;standard drink&lt;/a&gt; contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol. That is roughly 12 ounces of beer at 5 percent alcohol, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, which are the serving sizes researchers use to keep totals comparable across people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers classified participants as never, moderate, heavy, or former heavy drinkers based on interviews with family members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-alcohol-helped-ancient-people-build-better-societies/"&gt;Heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt; in this work meant eight or more drinks per week, a level that adds up faster than many people realize when pours are generous at home or at restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional autopsy analysis included 1,781 people with a mean age near 75 at death. All underwent standardized postmortem exams that recorded brain weight and neuropathology using standard stains to label lesions under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked for signs of brain damage such as tangled proteins, small strokes, buildup in blood vessels, and thickening of tiny arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also calculated a brain mass ratio by dividing brain weight by height and rated cognition using the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (&lt;a href="https://www.understandingalzheimersdisease.com/-/media/Files/uAD/Clinical-Assessment/CDR-Brochure.pdf"&gt;CDR-SB&lt;/a&gt;) to summarize abilities close to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol exposure was reconstructed from detailed interviews with relatives who knew the person well. This approach is common in autopsy cohorts but it depends on memory and records kept during life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used logistic and linear regression to estimate odds of lesions and differences in continuous measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team tested whether vascular injury mediated any links between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/even-small-amounts-of-alcohol-increase-cancer-risk/"&gt;drinking and cognition&lt;/a&gt;, asking if vessel damage could explain the path from alcohol to poor scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-vessel-damage-from-alcohol"&gt;Brain vessel damage from alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with people who never drank, the odds of hyaline arteriolosclerosis were higher in moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers, and former heavy drinkers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported odds ratios were 1.60, 2.33, and 1.89 respectively with confidence intervals that excluded 1.00, which signals an association in this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For tau pathology, only heavy and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-loss-drugs-unexpectedly-help-people-drink-less-alcohol/"&gt;former heavy drinkers&lt;/a&gt; showed higher odds of neurofibrillary tangles. Odds ratios were 1.41 for heavy and 1.31 for former heavy drinkers, indicating a specific link to tangles in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former heavy drinking tracked with a lower brain mass ratio and worse cognitive performance at the end of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beta estimates were negative for mass and positive for impairment, and only former heavy status met the threshold for these outcomes after adjustment for other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between alcohol, brain vessels, and cognitive abilities was fully mediated by hyaline arteriolosclerosis in the statistical models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In plain terms, the vascular injury appeared to sit between reported drinking and measured cognition within this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-might-mean"&gt;What this might mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When small vessels stiffen, they limit blood flow to fragile &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-reveals-the-secret-to-keeping-your-brain-young/"&gt;brain circuits&lt;/a&gt; that handle attention, speed, and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, injuries add up as white matter changes and microinfarcts that often go unnoticed in daily life, yet they can slow everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; attribute about 178,000 deaths per year to heavy and binge patterns across the country, placing alcohol alongside tobacco and obesity among top sources of avoidable harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This autopsy analysis cannot prove the cause, and the authors say so. It shows a statistical signal that aligns with what pathologists and stroke specialists see in vascular cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding alcohol to vascular risks like smoking, hypertension, or diabetes can stack the deck. Reducing intake and treating existing vascular risks could limit future &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alcohols-hidden-toll-on-the-brain-revealed/"&gt;small vessel injury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-health-alcohol-future-study"&gt;Brain health, alcohol, future study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dataset does not track how long people drank or how their habits changed across adulthood. Without a timeline, it is hard to test dose response or recovery during abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found heavy drinking is directly linked to signs of injury in the brain, and this can cause long-term effects on brain health, which may impact memory and thinking abilities,” said Alberto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol reports came from informants, so misclassification can occur when records are thin or memories fade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These donors came from one urban region with limited formal schooling on average, which can shape both drinking patterns and health access. Future cohort studies can test whether cutting back reverses vascular stress or slows tangle buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation analysis isolates a pathway, but it relies on modeling assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials and prospective cohorts that measure alcohol objectively and track imaging and cognition could answer questions about reversibility and thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40203226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 14:40:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPY3phNlpCbTl5U1JSaGkwYmhER3lmMFhsbU9YNi1IZ0k3R2Mtc21HT1kzYWxMdE1tem5xWHhacHBYc1JraTRicWN3UnBFMkV5eGMxbmFpUXdJUnFjV1NMWE4yQ1dlNkdLeFdNM19wNjNZa1NuNm43MEtjN3pJaEFmanVkNlpTekpMdlhlU2VDb2ZSLWNEeS16Vld2MDZWemdmNFFV</guid></item><item><title>您需要多少睡眠？参加测试，看看你是否有足够的睡眠-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15091999/How-sleep-YOU-need-test-youre-getting-slumber.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured, different steps of the night sleep cycle. Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep (marked in red) although some can also occur in non-REM sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep is generally separated in four stages. The first three of these are known as 'non rapid eye movement' or NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last stage is known as rapid eye movement or REM sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical night's sleep goes back and forth between the stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Stage 1&lt;/span&gt;: In the first five minutes or so after dropping off we are not deeply asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We are still aware of our surroundings but our muscles start to relax, the heart beat slows down and brainwave patterns, known as theta waves, become irregular but rapid.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although we are asleep during Stage 1, we may wake up from it feeling like we didn’t sleep at all.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After around five minutes our bodies move into stage two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Stage 2&lt;/span&gt;: This is when we have drifted into sleep, and if awakened would know you we been asleep. Waking up is still fairly easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This stage is identified by short bursts of electrical activity in the brain known as spindles, and larger waves known as K-complexes, which indicate that the brain is still aware of what is going on around it before turning off to a sub-conscious level.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heartbeat and breathing is slow, and muscles relax even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Our body temperature drops and eye movements stop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Stage 3&lt;/span&gt;: Stage 3 non-REM sleep is the period of deep sleep that we need to feel refreshed in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Our heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep and brain waves become even slower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Our muscles are relaxed and it people may find it difficult to awaken us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body repairs muscles and tissues, stimulates growth and development, boosts immune function, and builds up energy for the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypnagogia - the transitional state between wakefulness and sleep - is associated with NREM stages one to three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mental phenomena during hypnagogia include lucid thought, lucid dreaming, hallucinations and sleep paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/span&gt;:  REM sleep first occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Our eyes move rapidly from side to side behind closed eyelids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mixed frequency brain wave activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Our breathing becomes faster and irregular, and heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep, although some can also occur in non-REM sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Arm and leg muscles become temporarily paralysed, which prevents us from acting out our dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As we age, we spend less of our time in REM sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory consolidation most likely requires both non-REM and REM sleep.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: US National Institutes of Health &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 14:16:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPQmdjbVREbG0xZm44SU1JWGdrWkJjdnRGV0xuVTFkcjZVR1ExbUxJQ1Q4eFhXTDFQTFBjMXprUXhFOWRQeHpURnkxZURrdlNfYUxxeW5mdGJkdmIyOGFIQklITk5BYXJfc0dVYUlQeUxCcjdVeVFobFFIV1RHWENXeVpwZF9Eek80SVQ0NWc4R0o0VGxhSEJGWjRaUkJ4MGw1c1MxOUpBTGQxczDSAbABQVVfeXFMUEJlZENzdHlKU09IRkFWbEFGbTZxV3lxaG5wRkR0Sm9pSE5PZjkzaThJbF81bEY0N3cyVFZRRkZQcUtTcFJzd2VaNURkdVVRb3JDWnZULXRUVHNtdXh2RkF3MVhxQW5HTUdqZTV2bVVneC1DLUZlMFphRk43SUhGMVFkUDJDdHlSRW51NFpadFB6NGpZLV9MZ3kzZk9NNmxtdUphOENHOXpEU0hyTlFEUXU</guid></item><item><title>事实证明，在马桶上使用手机可能会给您带来相当痛苦的问题-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/technology/2025/09/hemmorhoids-phone-on-toilet-study.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffmne3200gwmwm9ikxxw8zw@published"&gt;If you bring your phone with you to the bathroom, you’re very normal. You’re also at risk of developing hemorrhoids—swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum that can cause pain and bleeding—according to a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329983"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that came out last week. Of the 125 adult participants in the study, two-thirds reported smartphone use during bathroom visits. Subsequent colonoscopies revealed that those bathroomgoers had a 46 percent higher risk of hemorrhoids than those who didn’t use their phones. It’s not the phone itself causing problems, of course, but the fact that it often prolongs a visit to the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffmoyr3001h3b794za90j5f@published"&gt;This probably isn’t news to you. The purported health risks of extended loo time have long circulated through doctors’ offices and news articles. “Don’t Sit on the Toilet for More Than 10 Minutes, Doctors Warn,” read a &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/health/phones-on-toilet-wellness/index.html"&gt;CNN headline&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. “Why You Shouldn’t Sit on the Toilet Longer Than 15 Minutes,” a &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19521086/time-spent-pooping/"&gt;Men’s Health article&lt;/a&gt; explained in 2016. Gastroenterologists have been advising a five-minute limit to their patients for as long as study co-author Trisha Pasricha can remember. “It’s what I heard when I was in training from the GI docs who were teaching me, and I kept saying it to my patients,” says Pasricha, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “It’s kind of what most people say.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffmoyr4001i3b799fq9zsn1@published"&gt;The scientific literature on the issue, however, is scant—&lt;a href="https://storage.annaliitalianidichirurgia.it/aic/100642/application/1755611221081.pdf"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)91717-0/fulltext"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2008.01204.x"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, the largest of which relied on hemorrhoid self-reporting rather than evaluations, which makes the results less reliable. (“There’s all kinds of other things that we just don’t think about that can be a little lumpy and bumpy on our butts that are actually not hemorrhoids,” Pasricha explains.) That’s what led Pasricha’s team to conduct this new study—and why the results were something of a relief. After all these years, “it’s nice to finally have data to offer patients,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="230" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffmoyr9001j3b79rzjerd0l@published"&gt;Given the finding, I can’t help but think: &lt;em&gt;Man, do we all have hemorrhoids?&lt;/em&gt; Because people have been guilty of &lt;a href="https://www.threads.com/@niksappy/post/C-NWBilpIZY"&gt;prolonged toilet sits&lt;/a&gt; since, well, there were toilets. “Roman baths contained libraries wherein one could pore over scrolls, and ‘The Life of St. Gregory’ (1296-1359) recommends the isolated retreat of the medieval fortress toilet … as a place for uninterrupted reading,” wrote Henry Alford in the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/books/review/23alford.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. In the 1700s, Lord Chesterfield wrote about a “gentleman” friend who read the Latin poets “in the necessary-house,” Alford notes. In the early 1800s, before the invention of toilet paper, people relied on pages of their reading material—typically &lt;a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/the-hole"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Old Farmers’ Almanac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which, in 1919, started including holes in the corner so it could be hung in outhouses and bathrooms. In 1979, jokester Jack Kreismer saw the vision for a line of books marketed specifically for use in the bathroom, and his &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00IPXYZUK/about?ccs_id=8620bfd6-bfd9-4d45-b88e-e7db1a2bd5b3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bathroom Library&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series burgeoned into a whole line of bathroom-reading-specific products (some might recall &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Bathroom-Readers-Institute/145527583"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncle John’s Bathroom Readers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;); of course, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/18ocgr7/readers_digest_in_the_bathroom/"&gt;Reader’s Digest&lt;/a&gt; was another bathroom staple. When no form of entertainment was available, we turned to the text around us, pretending to be interested in, hey, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/9frfgg/reading_the_back_of_shampoo_bottles_before_phones/"&gt;this tube of toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have smartphones. At this point, we’ve all more or less looked hemorrhoids square in the eye and decided it was worthwhile. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffmoyr9001k3b79uligrdqf@published"&gt;Not quite. While we don’t have long-term data on whether the length of people’s toilet trips has changed over the years, we do know that smartphones &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213002410"&gt;are addictive&lt;/a&gt; in a way that books, crosswords, and shampoo bottles simply aren’t. “Smartphones are so different from other reading material,” says Pasricha. “They are designed to maximize how much time you spend on them.” If you’re reading the funnies, you’ll eventually run out of funnies, and bathroom-reader books tend to be short by nature (which, at least for Kreismer, was never about keeping bathroom visits brief, but rather a happy coincidence of the genre). But TikTok and other social apps have no end. Part of the reason I use the phone on the toilet, I think, is to &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; my phone usage time. If I lie on the couch to scroll for a few minutes, it could easily turn into an hour—but on the toilet, I won’t be caught lingering. Right? Except, inevitably, people do.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffmoyr9001l3b79hgcvl0x8@published"&gt;That happens to be perhaps the most important finding of the new study, Pasricha says. Not that smartphone users are more likely to get hemorrhoids, or even that smartphone users were five times more likely to spend more than five minutes on the toilet than nonusers. Rather: The fact that 65 percent of the smartphone users were &lt;em&gt;not aware &lt;/em&gt;of how much longer they were spending on the toilet because of the phone. “Time is distorted when you’re staring at these screens,” says Pasricha. “If it’s highly engaging, you so quickly lose grasp of what you’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffmoyr9001m3b79bmwnyj3s@published"&gt;Indeed, a &lt;a href="https://www.qssupplies.co.uk/bathroom-doomscrolling.html"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; showed that it’s the phone-savvy younger generations that are spending the longest on the toilet—and we really don’t know yet what effects that will have on the body. It might not just be hemorrhoids: Over the long term, smartphones could lead to changing the very dynamics of our pelvic floors, suggests Pasricha. It’s something her team is looking into, and she hopes others will as well.&lt;/p&gt;

So don’t worry—you don’t have to give up the long tradition of bathroom reading. But consider how you might incorporate that five-minute limit. You might set a timer (can’t you just see a bathroom-timer feature in the next version of iPhone?), or try to keep yourself to a two-TikTok limit. Maybe dig out your old Reader’s Digests, or &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/09/bathroom-books-deep-thoughts-uncle-johns-bathroom-reader.html"&gt;prepare a new bathroom library&lt;/a&gt;.

              &lt;p&gt;If you’re a chronic insomniac, you might experience faster declines in memory and thinking skills than your better-sleeping fellows. In other words, your brain might age faster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214155"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, researchers revealed that people with chronic insomnia, described as having trouble sleeping at least three days a week for three months or more, were significantly more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia than their healthy counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Insomnia doesn’t just affect how you feel the next day—it may also impact your brain health over time,” Diego Carvalho, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and co-author of the study, said in an American Academy of Neurology &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-insomniacs-brain-aging.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We saw faster decline in thinking skills and changes in the brain that suggest chronic insomnia could be an early warning sign or even a contributor to future cognitive problems.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.5 years older&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To clarify, the researchers don’t know if insomnia causes brain aging; they just highlight an association. In the study, the team tracked over 2,500 cognitively healthy people with an average age of 70 for an average of 5.6 years. 16% of the participants had chronic insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;14% of the people with chronic insomnia developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia during the study, while only 10% of participants without insomnia developed those same symptoms. After the researchers took into account differences such as high blood pressure, use of sleep medications, age, and a diagnosis of sleep apnea, they revealed that insomniac participants had a 40% greater risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia than those without insomnia. That’s equivalent to 3.5 extra years of aging. Their performances in thinking tests also decreased faster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the patients with insomnia, those who reported less sleep than usual in the past two weeks were more likely to get lower cognitive test scores at the beginning of the study, equivalent to being four years older. Furthermore, they had more white matter hyperintensities (potentially damaged brain tissue from small vessel disease) and amyloid plaques (a protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease). The buildup of the latter was akin to that in people with a known genetic risk factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maintaining brain resilience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that insomnia may affect the brain in different ways, involving not only amyloid plaques, but also small vessels supplying blood to the brain,” Carvalho said. “This reinforces the importance of treating chronic insomnia—not just to improve sleep quality but potentially to protect brain health as we age. Our results also add to a growing body of evidence that sleep isn’t just about rest—it’s also about brain resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Participants who claimed to get more sleep than usual in the past two weeks had greater chances of having fewer white matter hyperintensities at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers admit that their results are limited by the fact that the insomnia diagnoses were from medical records that don’t indicate the severity of the symptoms or include undiagnosed cases. Nonetheless, the point of the study seems clear enough to me—get enough sleep. And if you can’t, get help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚀 The U.S. Space Force and Gravitics are developing an orbital aircraft carrier to transform &lt;strong&gt;satellite deployment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔒 The carrier offers an unpressurized environment to protect &lt;strong&gt;sensitive electronics&lt;/strong&gt; from harsh space conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤝 Public-private partnerships are crucial for advancing U.S. &lt;strong&gt;space superiority&lt;/strong&gt; and integrating new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌌 This initiative marks a new era in &lt;strong&gt;space exploration&lt;/strong&gt;, impacting security and international relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is making significant strides in space technology through an ambitious project that aims to transform satellite deployment. The cornerstone of this initiative is the creation of an orbital aircraft carrier by the innovative startup Gravitics. This development underscores the U.S.’s strategic commitment to maintaining space as a pivotal domain and highlights the growing collaboration between private companies and national defense agencies. As global tensions rise, the United States is taking decisive steps to ensure its dominance and secure its presence in the increasingly competitive space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Vision Behind the Orbital Aircraft Carrier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the U.S. Space Force, Gravitics is leading a bold $60 million project to develop an orbital aircraft carrier aimed at revolutionizing satellite deployment. This cutting-edge platform will enable the direct launch of satellites from Earth’s orbit, offering a quicker and more flexible response to national security challenges. By eliminating the need for traditional rocket launches, this approach provides a significant strategic advantage for military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbital carrier initiative aligns with the U.S. military’s goal of maintaining a strong orbital presence amid the potential for a space arms race. With a pre-positioned platform in orbit, the United States can deploy satellites as needed, addressing both immediate and long-term security issues. This advancement in space technology reaffirms the United States’ dedication to leading in this critical domain, positioning itself at the forefront of global space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OLVC7zeKgL"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy-reporters.com/news/china-unveils-fighter-sized-combat-drone-beijing-parades-autonomous-war-machine-that-matches-j-10-fighter-performance-while-us-falls-behind-in-unmanned-air-superiority-race/"&gt;“China Unveils Fighter-Sized Combat Drone”: Beijing Parades Autonomous War Machine That Matches J-10 Fighter Performance While US Falls Behind In Unmanned Air Superiority Race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enhancing Space Security and Superiority&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravitics’s orbital aircraft carrier is designed to house multiple satellites in an unpressurized environment, safeguarding them from the severe conditions of space. This protection of sensitive electronics and batteries is vital in an era characterized by electronic warfare and cyber threats. By isolating and shielding satellites, the United States gains a strategic advantage in enhancing its space security capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the carrier’s ability to conceal satellites from adversaries provides a tactical edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SgPrHC3UYw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy-reporters.com/news/russias-terrifying-2500-high-precision-missiles-production-plan-triggers-natos-worst-nightmare-for-2025-military-escalation/"&gt;Russia’s Terrifying 2,500 High-Precision Missiles Production Plan Triggers NATO’s Worst Nightmare for 2025 Military Escalation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gravitics CEO Colin Doughan describes the carrier as a “game-changer” that aligns perfectly with the Space Force’s mission of achieving orbital dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project not only strengthens military capabilities but also sets a precedent for future technological advancements in space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y7cPwE3R0Z"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy-reporters.com/news/this-revolutionary-249-mph-cruising-speed-train-cuts-weight-10-and-resistance-22-through-aerodynamic-engineering/"&gt;This Revolutionary 249 MPH Cruising Speed Train Cuts Weight 10% and Resistance 22% Through Aerodynamic Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public-Private Partnerships and Their Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the orbital aircraft carrier exemplifies the increasing importance of public-private partnerships in the space industry. Gravitics, along with Axiom Space, is also developing a pressurized space module, demonstrating its commitment to both national defense and commercial solutions. This dual approach underscores Gravitics’s alignment with the Department of Defense’s objectives and its growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborations between private companies and government entities are essential for integrating innovative technologies into national defense strategies. By working together, these partnerships strengthen the U.S.’s position in space while fostering the development of technologies with potential civilian applications. The success of these collaborations could open new market opportunities and further advancements in space technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Space Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of technologies like the orbital aircraft carrier, a new era of space exploration and utilization is on the horizon. This technological breakthrough has the potential to transform security, surveillance, and communication paradigms, impacting both military operations and private sector involvement. The implications are vast, signaling a shift in how space is utilized and governed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. Space Force and companies like Gravitics prepare for future challenges, questions about international space cooperation arise. How will these innovations affect diplomatic relations between nations? More importantly, how can we ensure that space remains a domain of shared peace and progress, benefiting all of humanity?&lt;/p&gt;

The bean comes from the same plant as soybeans but is harvested at an earlier stage when the plant is younger. “[Edamame are] high in plant protein and fiber, and because they’re harvested fresh, they’re also rich in vitamins like folate and vitamin K, which support bone and cardiovascular health,” Melvani said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mitchell also shared that edamame supports longevity, saying that, like mature soybeans, edamame is high in protein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.

Mike Brandt, 29, had left their small three-bedroom house in Center Barnstead, New Hampshire, a few hours earlier. He was supposedly meeting a client about his web design business – a side hustle from his high-school teaching job. Katie, also 29, thought this was a lie, but let &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;it go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie feared the knock meant trouble – or worse, that her husband was dead. She remembers the officer saying: ‘We’ve clocked your husband going &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;90 miles&lt;/span&gt; an hour, and we can’t catch him. He stopped at Cumberland Farms, bought beer, urinated on the side of the building, and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;took off.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, Mike pulled into the driveway, nearly hitting the deck. The officer coolly watched from the door as Mike, a hulking &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;6’ 3”,&lt;/span&gt; stumbled out of the car reeking of vomit, then threw up on the pavement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie didn’t know what to think. His strange behaviour had started during her first trimester of pregnancy, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;11 months&lt;/span&gt; before that visit from the police. She noticed something was off – Mike didn’t share her excitement about the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, she brushed off his indifference as marital, like being ignored by a spouse glued to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were the weird moments: the earbuds he refused to remove during her labour, lost in a &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; audiobook while she gave birth; the strange obsession with sweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Mike quit his teaching job, ostensibly to grow his web design business. But when she checked his phone, she found a slew of unanswered messages from angry customers. His designs, once beautiful, had turned chaotic with ugly fonts and bizarre layouts. Worse, he didn’t seem to notice the drop in quality or care about his upset clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were smaller, stranger things: he started licking food off his fingers at dinner. He stopped brushing his teeth and let his beard grow wild. These weren’t just quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it was the police incident that marked the end of the early days of Mike’s illness, when she could still recall how it had been before the intimacy between them was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It was like he was drifting far away,’ Katie said. ‘And I couldn’t &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;reach him.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Photo courtesy of Katie Brandt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen I met Katie, 45, at Tatte Bakery &amp;amp; Café in Brookline, Massachusetts, she had just finished a long afternoon on Beacon Hill, reciting her elevator pitch to state senators. She arrived for our meeting put together, in business casual, slightly weary from repeating her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie is tall and lanky with a big, toothy smile. Her voice is warm and even, the kind that draws people in. She greeted me with practised calm, coffee in hand, then pulled up a chair and leaned in close to hear better over the din of voices in the bakery. We fell back into the conversation we had been unspooling for months – about caregivers and the systems that fail to support them, about the meaning of loving someone through cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had already met each other through a webinar we had co-hosted on family caregiving. She spoke as a national advocate for dementia care; I, as a palliative care physician and consultant to the National Center for Equitable Care for Elders. But I wanted to take our conversation beyond titles and talking points. I wanted to learn how she’d transformed her life, following the slow, devastating unravelling of her husband by a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease, into a career shaping support structures for others. A path that led her to a position as the director of Caregiver Support Services at the renowned Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;She’d suspected all along that ‘something was terribly wrong’ while the doctors shrugged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie never sugarcoats her story. She replayed the timeline of events from &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;12 years&lt;/span&gt; ago, which had followed Mike’s diagnosis, at 31, with frontotemporal dementia – an illness that slowly erodes personality, judgment and emotional awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It had been two years of misdiagnoses before a doctor finally listened,’ Katie said. She’d suspected all along that ‘something was terribly wrong’ while the doctors shrugged. Depression, they said. Stress. Marriage problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a doctor diagnosed him with severe depression, the medications they prescribed made him sleepy and even more disconnected. She insisted that his psychiatrist order a scan of his brain. ‘Could he have a brain tumour?’ she asked. She remembers attempting to explain to the doctor the reasons for her concerns. But how do you explain that someone’s personality has vanished – when that person doesn’t even notice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one listened. Not Mike. Not the doctors. And, as it turned out, that scan was the wrong kind to show signs of frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mike tried to fix their washing machine with a butane torch, she knew something needed to change, and fast. Desperate, Katie brought Mike to her father’s doctor, a neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie coaxed Mike into the exam room with strategies that she had honed over the past year and a half. She never commanded him; instead, she made gentle suggestions like: ‘Let’s sit here. The chairs look comfortable.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before Mike stopped the interview, shortly after the doctor asked him to name words starting with the letter ‘F’. ‘Fuck!’ Mike yelled and abruptly left the exam room. Katie was left behind, stunned and alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It’s bad,’ the doctor said to Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;ot long ago, I spoke with the neurologist Brad Dickerson, Katie’s boss, about why frontotemporal dementia is difficult to diagnose. Dickerson is the director of the Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He sees patients referred by other doctors, often to confirm a diagnosis or, in some cases, to unwind years of misdiagnoses. His kind manner and trust-inducing smile come across even on a Zoom call – the kind of doctor you’d want. But his expertise lies in frontotemporal dementia, a fatal disease that progresses over time, as short as three years or as long as 12. Frontotemporal dementia has no cure and no proven treatments to slow its progression. In that sense, he is the kind of doctor you hope you’ll never need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of cases of frontotemporal disorder are inherited, leaving the remaining &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;85 per&lt;/span&gt; cent without a clear cause, according to Dickerson. He studies the familial forms of the disease. The hope is that knowing where to ‘shoot the arrow’ will help researchers develop targeted treatments for people with the inherited version, and suggest medical strategies for the unknown or sporadic types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We’re on the brink of personalised medicine for FTD – treatments tailored to fit a person’s unique biology,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;When executive functioning is lost, a person may become disorganised, inflexible or impulsive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask him to explain frontotemporal disorders, and he begins with a taxonomy lesson, categorising different symptoms of the disease according to which lobe of the brain they begin in – either the frontal lobes located directly behind the forehead or the temporal lobes that sit behind the ears, like a set of headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike had ‘behavioural variant’ frontotemporal dementia that began in the right side of the frontal lobe, according to his medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the disease gets worse, the frontal lobes slowly atrophy (or shrink), and circuitry to other parts of the brain becomes faulty as they clog with abnormal proteins. This disrupts cognitive processes such as executive functioning, which helps us plan, organise and pay attention. When executive functioning is lost, a person may become disorganised, inflexible or impulsive. Atrophying frontal lobes may also trigger repetitive behaviours – like incessant listening to &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; audiobooks – or obsessions such as an unstoppable desire to eat sweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike’s loss of interest in the world of Katie and their son tracks to a loss of metacognition or insight. Metacognition – our sixth sense – lights up the dark road ahead, helping us assess danger. It’s our inner mother warning us ‘Don’t do it.’ A decline in metacognition can lead to a fading of our emotional and social engagement and our ability to see others outside of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie sees the loss of partnership, when we are no longer being &lt;em&gt;seen &lt;/em&gt;by our special other, as the core disaster of frontotemporal dementia for families. Her work with caregivers, she tells me, recasts their role from invisible player to the ‘star in their own epic tale’, with ‘being there’ as the ultimate expression of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;‘They don’t forget things like an Alzheimer’s patient would – but their personality is completely different’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia is still widely misunderstood, even among medical professionals. One cause of diagnostic confusion is that the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s dementia – the most common cause of dementia in older adults – are different from frontotemporal dementia. Alzheimer’s usually begins in the back regions of the brain, with the first signs often emerging as memory and word-finding problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘With FTD, they don’t forget things like an Alzheimer’s patient would – but their personality is completely different,’ Dickerson said. He added: ‘FTD doesn’t fit the textbook definition of dementia that most doctors learned in medical school.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the diagnostic misadventures experienced by patients and families, he observes, are due to the use of screening tests that are structured to identify the memory loss seen in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, memory is preserved, at least in the early and middle stages of the illness: patients might be able to master a crossword puzzle but refuse to stop working on it to help prepare the family dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the full story, he interviews the patient and an ‘informant’, usually a family member, partner or close friend, since they are most likely to notice uncharacteristic behaviours as signs of something amiss. Without this perspective, the chances of missing a brewing frontotemporal disorder are high, as the patient, due to deteriorating metacognition, will tell you that ‘everything is fine.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;atie was close to her mother, Diane.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They spoke on the phone every day. She became a sanctuary for Katie, now a mother herself, as Mike’s interest in fatherhood slipped away. The day Katie received the news about Mike’s diagnosis, her parents were there, sitting in the doctor’s waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie remembers that day as the last time she saw her mother. She watched her parents step into the elevator down to the lobby as she followed Mike on his preferred route, the stairs. Four days later, her mother died in her sleep of a heart attack &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;at 58.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her mother’s death was the moment Katie realised there was no return to life as it had been. She would have to figure out her own life first, if she was going to support Mike through what lay ahead. With her mother gone, she left her job in New Hampshire and moved in with her father, newly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, in Massachusetts. In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, her home in Center Barnstead went into foreclosure, making it unsellable. She also lost her health insurance, which she had through Mike’s job. In the following months, Katie was swallowed by a bureaucratic vortex of securing medical insurance for her child and Mike. She applied for food assistance for the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;‘This horrible thing happened to me, and the world just kept turning, like it didn’t matter’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Mike died at 33, Katie had already begun shaping her grief into something structured. At rock bottom, she began to build. In the summer of 2012, a few months after he died, Katie started volunteering for the Boston-based arm of the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration. That role evolved into leading a support group and providing community education. In 2018, this work turned into a position at Mass General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Katie about how she was doing after years of caregiving, for Mike and then for her father, all while raising a child on her own. Why step back into the breach of dementia caregiving, this time as an advocate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘At first, the work was about finding my voice after years of isolation and loneliness,’ she replied. ‘This horrible thing happened to me, and the world just kept turning, like it didn’t matter.’ She wanted to tell her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it became about diving in, learning everything she could about how to help families living with dementia caregiving. ‘Some people want to leave a caregiving experience in the past,’ she said. Katie, meanwhile, wanted to fight, and pay things forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Courtesy the author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;atie’s work at Mass General is a mix of science communication, systems navigation and pastoral care. She lectures to national groups about family caregiving, sometimes to audiences as big as 1,000. She trains clinicians. She moderates forums where caregivers get to say out loud: ‘This sucks.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘When caregivers are part of our programme, they don’t need to Google to get answers,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also sits on advisory panels trying to improve the caregiver experience: fighting for supports and recognition, and for more rigorous training for neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie is unapologetic. She knows the story of Mike’s illness is compelling, and has learned to use it to bring attention to the caregivers behind the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I know we have to wait for science to cure Alzheimer’s and other dementias, but public policy and money could fix the problems that caregivers are afflicted by now,’ she &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;told me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;He tumbled down the stairs and lay on the floor, only to see his wife step over him to ‘top off her coffee’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Older Americans Act was reauthorised by Congress and included, for the first time, provisions that allowed patients under 60 with dementia to access support programmes that they previously were locked out of because of age. Katie was co-chair of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA), which pushed this legislation forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thinks that this updated law is game-changing for caregivers of patients with early onset dementias, and wonders how different things would have been for her if Mike had had access to caregiver services – and also for her father, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;at 58.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie invited me to sit in on a Zoom support group for caregivers of people with frontotemporal dementia. She routinely allows clinicians to sit in as learners, encouraging members to be the teachers, in a role-reversal. ‘It helps some of them find meaning to their experiences to share this way,’ Katie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, the largest of its kind in the country, is co-led by Katie and a colleague from Mass General. I watched Katie navigate the meeting with the calm of a pilot in the midst of an emergency landing, as members toggled between laughter and despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘If you want to know what they’re up against,’ she said, ‘listen to the caregivers!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark humour abounded as some recounted their bleakest moments of the ‘journey’, as many seasoned caregivers referred to it. One gentleman described how his wife ‘lost her nouns’, meaning she could no longer name objects. He would hold up two boxes to help her choose her morning cereal, and she would point to her choice. Another man recalled the moment he realised he needed a backup emergency plan: after tumbling down the stairs, he lay on the floor, only to watch his wife step blithely over him on the way to the kitchen to ‘top off her coffee’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;You are not imagining this. It is not your fault. No, he won’t get better. But you might&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie sees internet-based support groups as the single biggest technology innovation for caregiver support: exponentially expanding people’s access to information and strategies to support caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘People are trapped at home, oftentimes, or live in rural or remote places,’ she said. ‘But most people have a smartphone where they can log on and watch a webinar.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members nodded in agreement when one commented that the group ‘had saved my life’. But, mostly, there was relief at having found a space where people ‘get it’. A place where they understood the terrible years before a correct diagnosis, years of not knowing what was wrong, of being blamed, of feeling like they weren’t strong enough. They understood the weight of reconciling entrenched anger, hurt and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Katie navigates for the group is not just information, but translation. An existential formula for survival. You are not imagining this. It is not your fault. No, he won’t get better. But you might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ince FTD often starts with impulsivity, apathy and compulsive habits (in younger people typically, ages 45 to 65), patients can be misdiagnosed with mental health, drug or alcohol problems. For young families, the fallout can be life-altering. Jobs are lost. Children are confused. Partners can be marginalised or gaslit by their own communities. Family members sometimes report that their loved one’s &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;‘BS detector’&lt;/span&gt; is dysfunctional, making them vulnerable to financial scammers and other grifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurologist Richard Ryan Darby, who runs the Frontotemporal Disorder Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, is fascinated by what happens when brain changes lead to brushes with the law or outright criminality. I spoke with him about his work, which sits at the blurry edge where neurology and psychiatry meet. Darby uses MRI scans to study how different parts of the brain talk to each other. In healthy brains, these connections are balanced. But in people with frontotemporal dementia – a disease that strikes at the control centres for behaviour and judgment (remember metacognition) – this balance can fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darby’s theory? When one part of the brain goes offline because of damage, other regions start to take over, sometimes leading to odd or harmful behaviour, like breaking rules or even committing crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Her funny, nerdy librarian husband became ‘zombie-like’, as if he had been body-snatched by aliens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of his job is when his patient ends up behind bars, and he can’t reach them directly. ‘It’s always a struggle to get the patient’s information to the jail medical team,’ he said. ‘I’m never convinced that my patient is going to tell them about their diagnosis.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with Jill Rovitzky Black, whose ex-husband had frontotemporal dementia. His gruesome murder, while living in a homeless shelter, was widely covered in the news media a few years ago. Jill recounts the darker side of frontotemporal dementia, one that can subject a family or caregiver to intolerable threats. Jill describes her funny, nerdy librarian husband becoming ‘zombie-like’, as if he had been body-snatched by aliens. He gave away thousands of dollars of their savings to ‘internet lovers’, eventually ending up in jail for bank fraud. Jill paid for lawyers and bail but, ultimately, she needed to protect herself and her teenager. She left their 32-year marriage. Jill’s story, like Katie’s, is marked by legions of doctors not listening to her cries that something was strangely wrong, and the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia was ultimately made too late – on autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darby’s advice to law enforcement is clear: ‘If a law-abiding citizen commits a serious crime over the age of 50, consider the possibility of a brain disorder – and get a specialist involved.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he day after I met Katie at Tatte, she invited me to attend the Rare Disease Day in Boston, organised by the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council (MassBio). The event gathers a mix of leaders: biotech executives, scientists and policymakers all in one place, laser-focused on finding cures. Except today they are gathered to listen to stories. The agenda leans on words like ‘hope’ and ‘understanding’, with talks delivered by patients and families, the common thread being the years of misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch Katie work the room. She knows people’s backstories like others know recipes. Katie is singular in this environment, hoping to educate the group about the importance of family caregiver support. I snap a picture of her and the former CEO of MassBio. He brightens as she asks him about his family – about his son, whose life was saved by a new drug treatment for cystic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;It’s about easing the everyday hassles for caregivers so they have the space to care for their own health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over lunch, we dive back into the weeds of the caregiver experience and her hope for better policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The reason why being an advocate is so important to me is because, when I work with families, I see the same problems over and over: the economic impacts on working-age families, the loss of social networks, the negative impacts on the health of caregivers,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Think of all the policy gaps,’ she adds. No affordable options for respite, or homecare, or adult day programmes that can handle a younger person, to name a few. Medicaid insurance coverage, being a last resort, is only for those who qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie nods when I remark that working with families is never about finding silver linings or expecting white-knuckled grit, but about seeking clarity. It’s about easing the everyday hassles for caregivers so they themselves have the space to live and care for their own health. We agree that the full complexity of supporting caregivers can be summed up in one simple action on our part: listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie interrupts our conversation to take a call. It’s her father’s nursing home. He is now in his 70s with advanced Alzheimer’s. ‘Dad no longer recognises me,’ she says. Then she listens intently, makes a suggestion, and tells them: ‘I’ll stop by after work.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:03:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPNHpreEhBZzJEdGFfX0lZVkd4SmcwNzE5Q3VwdXBEcDgxT2p5T21rTkpoQTB4RG1mZmx6b0c1TWtuTTg3MmN5dnY2T25UdV81S2tNcURSamRyRDcwTWtmdi1na2d2TjBpRDJHNXJrR1llZHVRa2EzMlhEMnFER29TNA</guid></item><item><title>男性和女性谁对疼痛更敏感？答案可能会让您大吃一惊。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/17/chronic-pain-women/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V5Y6ZYMBFJDZXIY5FXYTBXWCFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is a common misconception that because women are able to give birth and routinely deal with sometimes agonizing period cramps, they are somehow better able to tolerate pain than men.

But the results, several athletes say, are “game-changing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It saved my life,” said former NFL offensive guard Robert Gallery, who traveled to Mexico in 2023 to try ibogaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not anxious all the time, I’m not depressed,” he continued, “I can go for a run and be thankful that I’m alive, rather than having a thought that I should step in front of a semi-truck coming down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychedelic substance is derived from the iboga plant, and proponents tout its ability to treat addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, or TBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt; &lt;div class="video-enhancement" data-vertical data-video-disable-history&gt;   &lt;div class="video-enhancement-player"&gt;    &lt;gn-video-player class="gvp block relative  aspect-[9/16] overflow-hidden  w-full bg-cms-color-brand-background lg:z-10" data-video-player data-video-authors="Clara Harter, Mark E.

at reducing anxiety, depression and cognitive challenges associated with TBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a miraculous thing,” said retired MMA fighter Tait Fletcher, who credits the treatment with freeing him from suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre even tried ibogaine to see if it could help his Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disease linked to TBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although athletes are just discovering ibogaine, the drug is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-26/could-psychedelics-help-solve-the-veteran-suicide-crisis-these-california-vets-say-yes"&gt;well known within the veteran community,&lt;/a&gt; which experiences high rates of brain injury and PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Stanford’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02705-w" target="_blank"&gt;study on the effects of ibogaine&lt;/a&gt; on special forces veterans, participants saw average reductions of 88% in PTSD symptoms, 87% in depression symptoms and 81% in anxiety symptoms. They also exhibited improvements in concentration, information processing and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No other drug has ever been able to alleviate the functional and neuropsychiatric symptoms of traumatic brain injury,” Dr. Nolan Williams, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, said in a statement on the results. “The results are dramatic, and we intend to study this compound further.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt; &lt;div data-element="media-set-2-up-vertical-multi-caption" role="figure" class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2.5 m-0 -mx-5 md:grid-cols-2 lg:m-0  xxl:-mx-10 "&gt;   &lt;div data-element="media-set-media-container" class="relative flex flex-col gap-2"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0174ab8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/320x480!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e46eef3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/568x852!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dacee76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/768x1152!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ef9a779/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1024x1536!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a620089/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1200x1800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A capsule containing a therapeutic dose of ibogaine." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d18171/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/320x480!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f6cf38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/568x852!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7ba4cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/768x1152!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/78916d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1024x1536!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ab8648/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/1200x1800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c81307d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1397x2095+779+0/resize/800x1200!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F75%2Fa3401d974a6895b9470c6a46185a%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-002.JPG" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;p data-element="media-set-caption" class="col-span-full mx-5 my-0 font-cms-font-service-text font-medium text-xs leading-3.5 text-cms-color-brand-text lg:mx-0"&gt; A capsule containing a therapeutic dose of ibogaine, a psychedelic used to help treat traumatic brain injury, PTSD and addiction.

(Magda Stuglik) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To receive federal approval, ibogaine would need to pass through multiple phases of clinical trials at the Food and Drug Administration and be moved by the Drug Enforcement Administration to a less restrictive drug category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schedule 1 drugs are considered to have no federally accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse and a lack of accepted safety. They also include psilocybin, MDMA, LSD and marijuana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States can work faster than the federal government by carving out exemptions for supervised ibogaine therapy programs, similar to what &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/" target="_blank"&gt;Oregon has done with psilocybin therapy&lt;/a&gt;. Many states have also opted to legalize marijuana for medicinal or recreational use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Dr. Ian Kratter said researchers have reported that ibogaine may stimulate brain healing by causing an increase in certain neurotrophic factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These factors signal for enhanced brain cell survival and synaptic plasticity, which is the ability for brain cells to modify the strength of their connections or even form new connections,” said Kratter, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. “This might facilitate a healing and recovery process after an injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Bickart, a UCLA neurology professor who specializes in brain injury in athletes, said that the Stanford study is “remarkably promising” and that it is reasonable to believe professional athletes could experience similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This group [veterans] is a strong analogue for retired professional athletes from high-contact sports like football or hockey who are now dealing with persistent cognitive and emotional difficulties,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, director of Penn Medicine’s TBI research center, said that ibogaine is “one of the more promising compounds” for treatment of TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Bickart, Diaz-Arrastia and the Stanford researchers all emphasized the need for larger, randomized controlled trials demonstrating a strong therapeutic benefit and safety profile prior to the treatment being used in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also highlighted the fact that ibogaine can cause heart problems such as cardiac arrhythmia and needs to be administered under strict medical supervision. In the Stanford study, cardiac monitoring and magnesium were used to mitigate this danger, and researchers reported that no participants experienced adverse cardiac effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallery heard about ibogaine when listening to a podcast about veterans whose struggles resonated with his own. He was at the end of his rope and willing to try anything to free himself from dark thoughts and the ringing noise inside his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of a last-ditch hope for me,” he said. “I was just at that place of needing the noise and the thoughts to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallery’s doctor believes he likely &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-nfl-cte-study-20181129-story.html"&gt;developed CTE&lt;/a&gt; (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) as a result of repeated brain injuries during his eight seasons in the NFL. CTE, which can only be diagnosed after death, is a severe neurodegenerative disease that can cause dementia, violent mood swings, loss of motor control and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many famous athletes who committed suicide were later determined to have CTE, including New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau and Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f123844/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/320x442!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6275fba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/568x784!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6332d44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/768x1060!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5743b76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1024x1413!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6d11dd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1200x1656!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A football player lifts another football player into the air." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c17a5f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/320x442!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/494c9f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/568x784!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/887e842/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/768x1060!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84174a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1024x1413!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/baf1bc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1200x1656!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/baf1bc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1317x1818+0+0/resize/1200x1656!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F7a%2F1009725a4bce983cc1dd8c211b83%2Fla-me-nfl-ufc-psychedelic-treat-brain-injury-hanout-007.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Former NFL offensive guard Robert Gallery, who played for the Raiders, credits ibogaine therapy with saving his life and relationship with his family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Robert Gallery)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher, the former MMA fighter who is also an actor and stunt artist, heard about ibogaine through his Navy SEAL friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had experienced many concussions during his fighting career, but it was head trauma during a stunt gone wrong in 2019 that pushed him over the edge and into an extremely dark place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following morning he woke up in a state of terror. He didn’t know how to pack his bags or get out of the hotel room he had been staying in for the shoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher spent the next year in near-total seclusion, largely unable to leave his house due to light and sound sensitivity. Like Gallery, he tried many conventional and experimental therapies, but nothing compared  with the relief that ibogaine brought him in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re putting Band-Aids on problems through pharmacology,” he said. “This [ibogaine] is a thing that I watched just set people free. Nothing short of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Jardine, a former UFC fighter, was inspired by Fletcher’s story and traveled to Mexico to receive treatment himself. Retired hockey player Ales Hemsky credits ibogaine with helping free him of the substance use and alcohol dependency that he struggled with after his 16-year career in the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been seven months now I haven’t had a sip of alcohol,” he said. “It’s life-changing. It really restarts your brain. It gives you a new path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher has seen the darkness brain injury brings to athletes and the light ibogaine provides. He wants both to be part of a bigger conversation in the professional sports world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6d15046/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/320x239!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b904482/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/568x425!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/faaca3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/768x574!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89d35c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1024x765!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/65009b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1200x897!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Tait Fletcher, stuntman and former MMA fighter, suffered traumatic brain injury." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59e2ee4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/320x239!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bccf06c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/568x425!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d635046/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/768x574!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ded1bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1024x765!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/03da6cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1200x897!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/03da6cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1203x899+0+0/resize/1200x897!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F5e%2Fd292353b415b8321dbfb6bd1813d%2Fme-tait-fletcher-handout.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Tait Fletcher, stuntman and former MMA fighter, suffered traumatic brain injury as a result of multiple concussive events during his career.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Paul Mobley)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish that these big organizations were looking into these things differently, because you could elongate careers and elongate lives,” he said. “And ibogaine is certainly a part of that conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favre also wants to see more attention brought to speeding up medical trials of new treatments for brain injury and related conditions. After taking ibogaine, his Parkinson’s symptoms disappeared for three days before gradually returning, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not disappointed by anything. I’m more excited about the opportunity knowing that I could do it again,” he said. “I’m hoping that this [conversation] helps open the door for not just ibogaine or psychedelic drugs, but just medication or treatments in general that can help people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bickart said there is a major gap in effective, approved treatments for the persistent symptoms of brain injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leaves many, including veterans and potentially former athletes, without reliable solutions for ongoing disability, cognitive difficulties, and psychiatric conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety that can stem from head injuries,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his own experience with ibogaine, Gallery co-founded a nonprofit called &lt;a class="link" href="https://athletesforcare.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Athletes for Care&lt;/a&gt; to educate athletes with TBI on treatment options and advocate for research into psychedelic-assisted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sports community is not very good about talking about  mental health,” he said. “Seeing the veterans take charge and take care of their community, I want to do that for the sports community and for my friends that I know that are out there suffering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-left&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

Bickart, the UCLA professor, echoed these concerns, noting that the most critical caution is safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should be wary of any unregulated treatments, as the purity dosage and presence of contaminants are often unknown,” Bickart said. “The placebo effect can also be very powerful, especially for treatments that require significant effort and cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambio, the clinic that Stanford researchers worked with for their observational study on ibogaine, stressed its &lt;a class="link" href="https://ibogaineguidelines.com/" target="_blank"&gt;safety protocols&lt;/a&gt; during treatment, including close monitoring of dosage and patients’ cardiac health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing political and scientific momentum in America for more clinical research of ibogaine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Texas approved a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/11/texas-psychedelics-ibogaine-treatment-addiction-rick-perry-funding/" target="_blank"&gt;historic $50-million investment&lt;/a&gt; in state funding to support drug development trials for ibogaine, inspired by the results seen by veterans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona legislators approved $5 million in state funding for a clinical study on ibogaine in March, and California legislators are  pushing to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-26/could-psychedelics-help-solve-the-veteran-suicide-crisis-these-california-vets-say-yes"&gt;fast-track the study&lt;/a&gt; of ibogaine and other psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, I’m amazed to see how much interest there is in ibogaine now,” said Ambio co-founder Jonathan Dickinson. “We’re starting to see things that we would have thought were unimaginable several years ago.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPT3hQS0J4MENub3VjMzRsNjFoWXV4aTUyOFJlZnp4cDBpRGd1M2lkSXpEVXJVSUhQaDhpOVJvM1liQndCRHN0T2kzXzdzbW1FaDRmQ0ZWYy10TDhXbHVVNnhNZVUzMVRNUl8zSUJNRDUyUUlfa3hOTzA3UkVHTF8zWGY3b0hTZ2dxSC1KVmx6QWRsVUN5TmlBX2VaR3p3b2sxMlp5bFAxaTlTMkk5eEtMcy0tMmI</guid></item><item><title>世界上最致命的动物可能就在雄鹿县的家外面。看看疾病预防控制中心怎么说- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/worlds-deadliest-animal-probably-outside-091013361.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bucks County is home to black bears, venomous snakes, and coyotes.

Make sure any drainage ditches are free of overgrown grass or any other obstructions preventing the flow of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC also recommends being mindful of what you wear. Mosquitoes are less attracted to light-colored clothing, and they are able to bite through t-shirts or other lightweight, tight-fitting clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What are the best mosquito repellents to use?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/fl-resident-guide-to-mosquito-control-ifas.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:repellents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;repellents&lt;/a&gt; with the following active ingredients typically provide reasonably long-lasting protection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus or PMD: "Products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus specifies that they should not to be used on children under the age of 3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Can some plants repel mosquitoes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While some residents have been told to plant marigolds, catnip, and other plants in their yard to repel mosquitoes, this may not work.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Scientists are calling on health authorities to classify Chagas disease – sometimes known as the "kissing bug disease" – as endemic to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease, a parasitic infection spread by bugs, mostly infects people in Central and South America. Still, human cases have been reported in Missouri and seven other states, and the bug that carries the parasite has been found in both Missouri and Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an article published this month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the article’s authors called for doctors, public officials and health agencies to classify Chagas as endemic – or regularly occurring – to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The United States is often labeled as nonendemic, and this designation permeates the scientific literature, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, the media, pest professional websites, and the general community of researchers and physicians,” the authors wrote. “Labeling the United States as non–Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After patients contract the parasite that causes Chagas, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;they can develop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a fever, rash, swelling and other symptoms. Over time, Chagas can cause serious cardiac and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classifying the disease as endemic could improve surveillance, research and public health responses, said Phil Budge, an infectious disease doctor at Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it's been several years now where folks have been kind of recognizing, ‘Hey, this is probably happening at low levels, and we catch it sometimes,’” he said. “But officially, it has not been considered endemic here in the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budge said that the article shouldn’t scare residents about getting sick. Instead, the authors are calling for a new understanding about the disease that would improve diagnostics and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC publishes the journal in which the article appeared, but its authors are from academic institutions in Florida, California and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chagas is caused by a parasite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that lives in a kissing bug’s feces. Humans can contract the parasite when the feces gets in a wound or bug bite, or gets into a person’s eye or mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs are moving north into the southern parts of the country, said Daniel Hoft, director of St. Louis University’s Division of Infectious Diseases, Allergy and Immunology and the head of the school’s Center for Vaccine Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the last 10 years, there has been a slow creep of the insect vector from Latin America into the United States,” said Hoft, who has studied Chagas for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs have been found throughout the St. Louis region, said Ellen Santos, an epidemiologist and researcher. While she was a professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Santos and her coauthors published a study showing where the bug is found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in 2023 in the Journal of Medical Entomology, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/61/6/1273/7468094?login=false" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;noted the bugs were found in dozens of counties&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Missouri and Illinois. Some of the bugs found in the region carried the parasite that causes Chagas disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the takeaway is that it is technically possible for it to happen, because we do have all the right players all in the same place,” Santos said. “We have the bugs, we have the parasites, we have people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, even though it's possible, it's probably still not likely, and that is largely because of the way that the parasite is actually transmitted to people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the United States are less likely to sleep outside and are thus less likely to be bit by the bugs. The species of kissing bugs in the U.S. also doesn’t defecate as readily as others after feeding, so it is less likely to spread the parasite, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's really gross, it's fascinating,” Santos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Chagas symptoms can be mild and resemble those of other illnesses, many people don’t know they have the parasite, only finding out when their blood is tested during medical procedures or blood donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened to a Missouri patient in 2017, according to state health officials. In &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6907a4.htm" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a case study published&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in 2020, a person's donated blood tested positive for the disease. She had no travel history, which indicated the infection had originated in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the patient learned she had Chagas, she was screened for heart problems, which showed she had a chronic case of infected cardiac tissue. The patient was treated with anti-parasite medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, it’s the only case of Chagas the state has documented in a resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labeling the disease as endemic could lead doctors to consider such screenings, said Budge, of Wash U. That could mean patients like the Missouri woman could get treatment before serious health problems pop up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the target audience [for the article] was … public health officials, politicians, infectious disease specialists and other doctors trying to raise the awareness that when you have someone that has compatible signs and symptoms, you should think about this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoft said he hoped the article would spur more interest in the disease. His lab has developed two potential human vaccines for Chagas, but they haven’t moved beyond preliminary testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hardest thing for me to get funded is Chagas,” Hoft said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virginia “Ginger” (Cochran) Crisp passed away on Tuesday,  September 9, 2025, in&lt;br&gt;
Walnut Creek, California, at age 67.  Ginger was born in Springfield,&lt;br&gt;
Illinois on July 27, 1958, the daughter of Richard “Dick” and Virginia&lt;br&gt;
Anne Cochran.  Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Fairfield, where&lt;br&gt;
Ginger attended Fairfield public schools, graduating with the FCHS class&lt;br&gt;
of 1976.  From there, she attended the University of Illinois,&lt;br&gt;
graduating in 1980 with a degree in Elementary Education. She taught&lt;br&gt;
school in Houston, Texas for two years, before deciding to&lt;br&gt;
follow her father into a career in law.  She moved to the San Francisco&lt;br&gt;
Bay area to attend the University of California Hastings College of the&lt;br&gt;
Law, graduating in 1985. After graduation, she worked as a law clerk for&lt;br&gt;
Federal District Court Judge Eugene Lynch and as a partner at the&lt;br&gt;
Coblentz law firm in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is survived by her beloved husband of 39 years, Stanley Crisp, and&lt;br&gt;
their two daughters, Alison Crisp, MD, and Rebecca Crisp, DVM. Also&lt;br&gt;
surviving are her two siblings, Richard Cochran, Jr. (Lucy) and Susan&lt;br&gt;
Young (Mark), along with seven nieces and one nephew. She was preceded&lt;br&gt;
in death by her parents, Richard “Dick” Cochran, and Anne Cochran, of&lt;br&gt;
Fairfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout her life, people were drawn to Ginger.  Her strength, humor,&lt;br&gt;
intelligence and generosity made it a pleasure to be in her orbit.  She&lt;br&gt;
was the hub of many friend groups – from high school, law school, work&lt;br&gt;
places, neighborhoods, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger greatly enjoyed travel with her family, extended family, and&lt;br&gt;
friends.  She took them to South Africa, Italy, France, Spain, England,&lt;br&gt;
Costa Rica, and numerous other destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She died after a long battle with blood cancer. For those who are able&lt;br&gt;
and would like to honor her legacy, her family would appreciate&lt;br&gt;
donations of blood in her memory.  She relied on transfusions for much&lt;br&gt;
of her last year and always spoke of wishing she could give back.&lt;br&gt;
Alternatively, monetary donations in her honor could be made to Blood&lt;br&gt;
Cancer United, in the hopes that future patients to battle this horrible&lt;br&gt;
disease will have more options in their fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

If you feel drained, even after a good night’s sleep, it is a red flag. People often dismiss this sign as general tiredness. Persistent fatigue and lack of energy, especially in the morning, could be due to the body’s inability to use glucose for energy. Elevated blood sugar levels at night can also disrupt energy metabolism, because in people with prediabetes, the cells resist insulin, leaving glucose unused. This could lead to lethargy that is especially worse in the morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 06:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>科学认为睡前技巧可以改善每晚的深度睡眠-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/the-bedtime-trick-that-science-says-improves-deep-sleep-every-night/articleshow/123765766.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling to get truly restful sleep isn’t just frustrating; it can affect your metabolism, brain function, and overall health. Recent research highlights that small bedtime habits can significantly improve deep, restorative sleep. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(23)00219-7" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by UC Berkeley researchers found that synchronized brain waves during deep sleep, called slow waves and sleep spindles, play a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. Individuals with better synchronization experienced improved insulin sensitivity the following day. Take a close look..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding shows that activating the brain’s natural “sleep switch” can have real, measurable health benefits. Simple evening habits can encourage your brain to enter this deep, restorative phase, improving not just restfulness but also long-term metabolic health. In this article, we’ll explore science-backed strategies to optimise your bedtime routine, enhance deep sleep, and wake up feeling genuinely refreshed every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

Prioritising good sleep hygiene, such as reducing screen time before bed and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, can help enhance the quality of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC Berkeley study showed that individuals with better brain wave synchronization during deep sleep had improved insulin sensitivity the next day. This suggests that quality deep sleep is linked to both metabolic health and overall wellness. Poor deep sleep has been associated with increased risks of diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline, making it essential to prioritise this stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Science-backed evening habits for better deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing specific habits before bedtime can activate the brain’s natural sleep mechanisms and enhance deep sleep. Practices such as reducing screen time, dimming lights, practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule help prepare the body and mind for restorative rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dim your lights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bright light in the evening can suppress melatonin, the hormone that signals to your body it’s time to sleep. Reducing light exposure an hour before bed helps your brain prepare for restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Limit screen time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phones, tablets, and TVs emit blue light that disrupts melatonin production. Avoid screens at least 30–60 minutes before bed to support natural sleep rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create a calming pre-sleep routine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle stretching, meditation, reading, or listening to soothing music can relax your mind and body. A consistent pre-sleep routine signals your brain that it’s time to transition into deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stick to a consistent sleep schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and stay in deep sleep longer. This consistency supports better hormone regulation, improves mood, enhances cognitive function, and can even strengthen your immune system over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Optimise your sleep environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Comfortable bedding and minimal noise reduce disturbances, promoting longer periods of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle factors that impact deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nutrition matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime can interfere with sleep cycles. A light, balanced snack that includes protein and complex carbs may help, while staying hydrated without overdoing fluids before bed is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can improve sleep patterns and increase deep sleep duration. Avoid vigorous workouts right before bed, as they may be stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also See: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/7-vs-9-hours-of-sleep-whats-the-ideal-amount-and-why-it-might-not-be-what-you-think/articleshow/123118501.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;7 vs 9 hours of sleep: What’s the ideal amount and why it might not be what you think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to consult a professional&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If sleep difficulties persist despite following these habits, it may be time to consult a healthcare provider. Persistent issues could indicate conditions such as insomnia, sleep apnea, or other underlying health problems that need professional evaluation and targeted treatment to improve sleep quality and overall well-being. Early intervention can prevent complications and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small, science-backed changes to your evening routine can significantly improve deep, restorative sleep. By dimming lights, limiting screens, establishing a calming pre-sleep routine, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, optimising your bedroom environment, and paying attention to diet and exercise, you can help your brain enter the deep sleep phase more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep is more than just hours spent in bed; it’s about achieving the restorative deep sleep that supports overall health, metabolic function, and cognitive performance. Prioritising these habits allows you to wake up feeling refreshed, energised, and ready to take on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

                                        &lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A regulator has approved a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/koala-chlamydia-vaccinations-australia-f0a3e0a7d465dfa5ae0005f414bf6c29"&gt;world-first vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to protect koalas from chlamydia infections, which are causing infertility and death in the iconic native species that is listed as endangered in parts of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent approval by Australia’s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation’s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“We knew a single-dose vaccine — with no need for a booster — was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,” Timms said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,” Timms added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“At the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It’s just ridiculous,” Tabart said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabart’s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“I accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they’re sick because they haven’t got any habitat,” Tabart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queensland Conservation Council, an umbrella organization for more than 50 environmental groups across the state, welcomed the vaccine. But the council’s director, Dave Copeman, echoed Tabart’s focus on preserving koala habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really good news. Chlamydia is one of the key stresses that has been putting pressure on koala populations,” Copeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Koalas were at risk before chlamydia outbreaks, and they will remain at risk even if we manage chlamydia perfectly, because we keep on destroying their habitat,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koalas are &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-australian-capital-territory-new-south-wales-queensland-environment-f38e062d7ae4806f9d4f7f67dd538968"&gt;listed as endangered species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the states of Queensland and New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory, with habitat loss due to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-30c1bc2deec7a64735a366745825c70e"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and urban expansion as the major threats. Chlamydia can cause urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with antibiotics can disrupt an infected koala’s ability to digest eucalyptus leaves — its sole food source — leading to starvation, the university said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The research has been supported by the federal, New South Wales and Queensland governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt said his government had contributed to the vaccine’s development through a 76 million Australian dollar ($50 million) Saving Koalas Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that koalas need help to fight diseases like chlamydia. It’s a widespread threat impacting their reproductive health and causing infertility,” Watt said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials, like &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/baby-wombat-american-influencer-australia-marsupial-cube-poop-d97862f5a9b86dbacc1293e2a8adc9f9"&gt;wombats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/kangaroos"&gt;kangaroos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping in eucalyptus trees, and their paws have two opposing thumbs to help them grasp and climb up tree trunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s wild koala populations have declined steeply in the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing compounded threats from disease, habitat loss, climate change and road collisions, koalas could become extinct by 2050, according to a 2020 assessment from the New South Wales government.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Los Angeles County child has died due to complications from a measles infection, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Los Angeles County Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say that the "school-aged" child acquired measles in infancy, before they were old enough to receive the vaccine, which is generally administered between 12 and 15 months of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the child recovered from their initial illness, they later developed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which is also known as SSPE. Officials said that the complication is universally fatal and can occur in people who had measles early in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSPE is a rare, progressive brain disorder that can develop two to 10 years after a person's initial measles infection, even if the patient has seemingly fully recovered, officials said. It is characterized by a gradual loss of neurological function, with death occurring one to three years after it is initially diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said that there is no known cure or treatment for SSPE, which impacts about 1 in 10,000 people with measles. They say that the risk may be much higher for those who get measles as infants, at a rate of 1 in 600 people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This case is a powerful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members," said a statement from County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis. "Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity. Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself — it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles cases in the U.S. hit the highest total recorded in more than 30 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took the incident as a time to remind the public that measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is used to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, health officials said. While most children will receive their first vaccine dose between 12 and 15 months, a second dose isn't administered until they're between four and six years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that develops three to five days after the fever is first noticed. If people exhibit any of those signs, they're advised to stay home and avoid school, work or any other public gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Department of Public Health officials urged people to check their own immunization status and to notify their healthcare provider if someone they know is at a higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fcases-outbreaks.html%3Futm_content%3D%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_name%3D%26utm_source%3Dgovdelivery%26utm_term%3D&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_name=&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;amp;utm_term=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;So far in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, there have been 1,454 reported cases of measles in the United States, most of which are linked to a measles outbreak affecting Texas, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, officials say that the majority of reported cases have been in people who were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, and that 12% of infected patients required hospitalization or isolation. Three people have died from acute measles-related complications, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last known case of the virus in a county resident was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/los-angeles-public-health-officials-confirm-measles-case-in-lax-traveler/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;reported in August&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. DPH officials say that eight cases of measles in individuals who were in the county while infectious, four were non-residents.&lt;/p&gt;

The disease begins with seizures, cognitive decline and involuntary muscle spasms, and progresses to dementia, coma and eventually death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most pediatricians in the U.S. have never seen a child with SSPE because we’ve been vaccinating kids against measles for decades,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-02-10/adam-ratner-booster-shots-book"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said Dr. Adam Ratner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based pediatric infectious-disease specialist and author of the book, “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health could not release further details on the child’s age, gender or location due to patient privacy laws, a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department could only confirm that the child acquired measles before becoming eligible for an MMR vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,” county health officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a statement. “Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children typically receive their first MMR dose when they are 12 to 15 months old and a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early first dose from the age of 6 to 11 months is recommended for babies traveling internationally or through an international hub. Infants under the age of 6 months are too young to receive the MMR shot, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very young babies rely on antibodies acquired during gestation and herd immunity to protect them from measles, which killed roughly 400 children every year in the U.S. before the introduction of the combined MMR vaccine in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was “eliminated” in the U.S. in 2000, meaning the disease was rare enough and immunity widespread enough to prevent local transmission if an errant case popped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 25 years, parents in the U.S. have been able to trust that herd immunity will keep infants safe from measles until they are old enough to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recent death may be a signal that social contract is beginning to break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood immunization rates have been slowly but steadily falling nationwide, from 95% in the years before the COVID pandemic to below 93% &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the 2023-24 school year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, one of five U.S. states that banned all non-medical vaccine exemptions, the vaccination &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2023-2024KindergartenReport.pdf#:~:text=The%20proportion%20of%20kindergarten%20students%20reported%20as,up%20on%20immunizations%20missed%20during%20the%20pandemic" target="_blank"&gt;rate that year was&lt;/a&gt; 96.2%.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3200132/"&gt;Appendix cancer&lt;/a&gt; is a condition that, until recently, was so rare that most people never gave it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, it was the kind of disease that doctors might encounter only once or twice in a career, and it was almost always found in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/appendix-cancers-rise-younger-generations-study-finds-rcna211796"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; a surprising and concerning trend is emerging: &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;appendix cancer is being diagnosed more often&lt;/a&gt;, and it's increasingly affecting people in their 30s, 40s and even younger. This shift has left many experts puzzled and searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-pooping-habits-could-harm-your-health-in-7-ways-research-shows"&gt;Your Pooping Habits Could Harm Your Health in 7 Ways, Research Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine. Its purpose in the body is &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Why-do-Humans-have-an-Appendix.aspx"&gt;still debated&lt;/a&gt;, but it's best known for causing appendicitis, a painful inflammation that often requires emergency surgery. What's less well known is that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="174031" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; can develop in the appendix, usually without any warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, has shown that the number of appendix cancer cases has increased dramatically among people born after the 1970s. In fact, the incidence has tripled or even quadrupled in younger generations compared with those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall numbers are still small (appendix cancer affects just a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9418812/#:%7E:text=Overall%2C%20the%20incidence%20of%20appendiceal,5.1%20to%2011.2%20per%20cent."&gt;handful of people&lt;/a&gt; per million each year) the rapid rise is striking. Even more notable is that about one in three cases now occurs in adults under 50, a much higher proportion than seen in other types of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's behind this surge? &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/vitamin-d-colon-cancer-b2744234.html"&gt;No one knows for sure&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the first suspects is the dramatic change in lifestyle and environment over the past several decades. Obesity rates have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3543235/"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s, and being overweight is a known risk factor for many cancers, including those of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, diets have shifted toward more processed foods, sugary drinks, and red or processed meats, all of which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; in other &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;parts of the gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has also &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, with more people spending long hours sitting at desks or in front of screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that we are being exposed to new environmental factors that previous generations didn't face. The industrialisation of food production, the widespread use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39518141/"&gt;plastics and chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, and changes in water quality might all play a role. However, the evidence is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167729" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water.jpg" alt="water pouring from tap into glass" class="size-full wp-image-167729" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167729" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes in water quality might play a role in appendix cancer cases increasing. (pixelshot/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard to detect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes appendix cancer especially challenging is how difficult it is to detect. Unlike colon cancer, which can sometimes be found early through screening colonoscopies, appendix cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094592/"&gt;usually flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms, if they appear at all, are vague and easy to dismiss. People might experience mild abdominal pain, bloating or changes in bowel habits, which are common complaints for many benign conditions. As a result, most cases are only discovered after surgery for suspected appendicitis, when it's often too late for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in cases, there is no routine screening test for appendix cancer. The disease is simply too rare to justify widespread screening, and the appendix can be difficult to visualise with standard imaging or endoscopy. This means that both patients and doctors need to be extra vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone experiences persistent or unusual abdominal symptoms, especially if they're under 50, it's important not to ignore them. Early investigation and prompt treatment can make a significant difference in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in appendix cancer among younger adults is part of a broader trend seen in other gastrointestinal cancers, such as those of the colon and stomach. These cancers, too, are being diagnosed more often in people under 50, suggesting that shared risk factors may be at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this shift are complex and probably involve a mix of genetics, lifestyle, environment and perhaps even changes in our &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; – the bacteria in our intestines that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882224/"&gt;live with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, antibiotics have been used more frequently, both in medicine and in agriculture. This widespread use can alter the balance of bacteria in our guts, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7916407/"&gt;might influence cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests that early-life exposure to antibiotics could have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;long-term effects on the digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, but more studies are needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg" alt="Different types of tablets or pills in foil packs" class="size-full wp-image-164410" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-484x415.jpg 484w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-600x514.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could early-life exposure to antibiotics have something to do with the rise in appendix cancer? (PublicDomainPictures/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the best advice is to focus on prevention and awareness. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and staying physically active are all steps that can lower the risk of many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake are also &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;. While these measures can't guarantee protection against appendix cancer, they are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;proven strategies&lt;/a&gt; for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working hard to unravel the mystery of why appendix cancer is rising so rapidly among younger generations. Understanding the causes will be crucial for developing better ways to prevent, detect and treat this rare but increasingly important disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, raising awareness among healthcare providers and the public is essential. By recognising the signs and taking action when symptoms arise, we can improve the chances of catching appendix cancer early and giving patients the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-kissing-bug-disease-is-on-the-rise-across-the-us-cdc-warns"&gt;Deadly Kissing Bug Disease Is on The Rise Across The US, CDC Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of appendix cancer's rise is a reminder that even rare diseases can become more common when our environment and lifestyles change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a call to action for further research and for all of us to pay attention to our bodies, seek medical advice when something feels off, and support efforts to understand and combat this puzzling trend.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258607/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

"We saw Danish patients out of their own pocket paying for tickets to China to get all sorts of treatments – endangering their health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some went to private hospitals in Germany that offered new treatments unavailable in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Back then, Denmark's record on cancer was low compared to that of other rich countries. But so was the UK's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;From 1995 to 1999, Denmark's five-year survival rate for rectal cancer was essentially tied with the UK's, on around 48%, according to the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, a research body. It put both nations well below countries like Australia, which had a 59% rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Now, thanks to a bold plan, Denmark's performance on cancer has jumped ahead. By 2014, its five-year survival rate for rectal cancer had risen to 69%, close to Australia's. (The UK's rose too, but only to 62%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Analysts think the trend has probably continued (though these are the most up-to-date figures available). And it's a similar story for other cancers, including colon, stomach, and lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This Danish success story has caught the attention of UK policymakers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting says that aspects of the Danish model are feeding into government plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some could well be included in a new long-term cancer plan for England, due to be published in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So, what's their secret, and can the NHS learn from Denmark?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Big investments and thoughtful touches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Walking today into Herlev Hospital on the outskirts of Copenhagen makes for a rather different experience to arriving at an average NHS hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The foyer is hung with bright, vivid paintings by the Danish artist Poul Gernes.

"They purchased between 30 and 60 - they're an integral part of the way we work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Particularly important for cancer are CT scanners, which look deep inside a person's body. Denmark now has about 30 of them per million people - the average of other rich countries stands at 25.9. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The UK, meanwhile, lags way behind with just 8.8 scanners per million people, according to the 2021 figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8bb3/live/f6660e80-8f29-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images King Frederik X of Denmark and Queen Mary of Denmark look at a brightly colour art work " class="sc-86c96223-0 fHZDyi"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-86c96223-2 hqrvRC"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Vivid artwork by the Danish artist Poul Gernes appears in the hospital.

Unless funding to meet increasing patient demand is made, they argue, England could continue to lag behind on the quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This all comes despite the fact that Denmark's health spending hasn't seen a huge boost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Calculated by spending per head of the population, Denmark is ahead; but as a share of national income, its health spending is similar to, and in fact slightly below that of the UK's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;A bold set of plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is just one part of a bold plan drawn up by Danish health leaders. Along with introducing new equipment, and rethinking the atmosphere of hospitals, they also made it possible for patients to be treated with chemotherapy at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;New national standards govern how quickly Danes must be treated: following a referral, a cancer diagnosis has to be given within two weeks. Then, if treatment is required, it has to start within the two weeks of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If these targets are not met patients have the right to transfer to another hospital - or, failing that, another country - whilst still being funded by the Danish health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is quite a contrast to the UK nations.

Alcohol consumption is similar in both nations, though obesity levels in Denmark are lower and smoking rates are higher.

And the NHS is a complex organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Still, ministers have made no secret of their interest in the Danish system, with an official visit earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Wes Streeting, the UK Health Secretary, says: "Denmark's healthcare system is known the world over for its excellence, having transformed outcomes through its cancer plans, and Health Minister Karin Smyth's trip to the country earlier this year offered us vital insights up close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Streeting says these insights have "fed into" government health plans to "speed up cancer diagnoses and deliver cutting edge treatments to the NHS front line quicker".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Michelle Mitchell of Cancer Research UK agrees that Denmark offers a useful template. "They are diagnosing cancer earlier, people are surviving longer, more people are taking up screening – all of those factors as well as investment in workforce and kit are critical components of a cancer plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She argues that British health ministers could move towards Danish-style national waiting time targets rather than the UK's current system of "benchmarks", which are weaker and haven't been met since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'This is unfinished business'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The greater challenge for the NHS though, is that there are so many other problems - crowded A&amp;amp;E departments, overstretched staff and, as one analyst put it, "multiple fires burning" - meaning that it can be difficult to persuade health leaders to focus on cancer survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ruth Thorlby, assistant director of policy at The Health Foundation think tank, says that policymakers in London and Copenhagen both realised at the same time, in the 1990s, that cancer needed urgent attention and urgent plans were drawn up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But whilst Danish policymakers saw policies through, she argues that in the UK the momentum "dissipated", as other priorities and short-term problems emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This is unfinished business - over the last decade there has been a move away from cancer plans," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="PA Wire A member of staff on a NHS hospital ward" class="sc-86c96223-0 fHZDyi"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-86c96223-2 hqrvRC"&gt;PA Wire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Ruth Thorlby says that while Denmark stuck with its cancer plans, the UK lost momentum as other priorities took over&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At the heart of Denmark's success was a sense of political consensus.

"Politicians must promise each other there is going to be a long, lasting partnership.

After all, Westminster is not known for much long-term, cross-party thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"If you are really decisive, if you really want to do this and are committed to it over a period of time, and you are also ready to invest then I think it can be done," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;With a pause, he adds: "Nothing comes without investment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-indepth" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;BBC InDepth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-and-we-showcase-thought-provoking-content-from-across-bbc-sounds-and-iplayer-too.-you-can-send-us-your-feedback-on-the-indepth-section-by-clicking-on-the-button-below." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

&lt;p&gt;In a statement to KQED, the California Department of Public Health said Wednesday that it endorses recent recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for COVID-19, influenza and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance, released last month, was in line with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations under the Biden Administration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“As a part of our efforts, along with our West Coast state partners and other states around the country, to provide a unified science-based approach to protecting the health of our communities, California is carefully considering guidance from various trusted national medical professional and scientifically based organizations,” the CDPH said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the CDC sets vaccine recommendations based on the available data, which insurers use to set reimbursement guidelines. But under the direction of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has espoused virulent anti-vaccine rhetoric for decades — the CDC now only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccines for “most adults ages 18 years and older.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That left many in the medical community concerned that confusing and inconsistent messaging would cause vaccine rates to drop, and even make vaccines unaffordable for lower-income families whose insurance providers may no longer cover them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/abraar-karan"&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University, said the state is making a “wise” choice because data show that vaccines help minimize COVID-19 infections in typically healthier populations like children older than six months and young adults, and reduce the risk of urgent care and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients “by 33%.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s pretty significant, and sort of mirrors what you see with flu vaccines as well. Functionally, that is what we are hoping for, for the general population, is to make you get less sick, fewer days of [missed] work [and] less utilization of the health care system,” Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“COVID spreads in waves. We have multiple waves per year, and they do require a large usage of our health care system. So if we have a safe, effective vaccine to reduce that healthcare usage in that healthier group, that’s important.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Karan said that because California is following the guidance of leading medical groups, it’s likely insurance companies will cover the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he said, those states are adhering to the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whereas what is happening at HHS is … a lot of opinions, particularly from RFK Jr. himself, on unproven therapeutics, on risks that are not borne out by the data. And then he’s sort of just hand-waving and doing whatever he wants,” Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; all 17 members of an advisory committee that helps the CDC form its vaccine policies to begin to “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/wsj-kennedy-op-ed-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines.html"&gt;restore public trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/john-swartzberg"&gt;Dr. John Swartzberg&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, said that by following the advice of leading medical groups, California and the other states of the West Coast Alliance are making it easier for families to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the data for very young children in terms of hospitalization and death, the rates are pretty comparable to older Americans,” Swartzberg said. “This is a vulnerable population where protection is terribly important. So I think that the California Department of Public Health, in following the advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics, is spot on.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Swartzberg said it is interesting to note that President Donald Trump even pushed back on Kennedy’s anti-vax stance in the last few days. Trump even &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/vaccine-policy-cracks-showing-between-trump-kennedy/"&gt;expressed some skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about Florida’s push to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think there are people in the administration who recognize that this is a hot button item, and all the Republicans are not really on board with where Kennedy is, so that might translate into the administration not trying to make a political football out of this with California,” he said. “We are very fortunate here in California. We have a department of health that is science-based and really solid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-get-a-new-covid-vaccine-right-now"&gt;Who can get a new COVID vaccine right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated 2025–26 COVID-19 vaccines are currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/scheduling/patient-lookup?lob=rximz&amp;amp;flow=vaccine&amp;amp;icid=global-nav"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.walgreens.com/topic/promotion/covid-vaccine.jsp?ban=immhub_covidinfo"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.safeway.com/pharmacy/covid-19.html"&gt;Safeway &lt;/a&gt;pharmacies in California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Pharmacies take their cue from the federal government, not the states, so they’ve always been the first places that COVID-19 vaccines roll out — before shots become more widely available through providers and public health authorities.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pharmacy appointments are only available to people who, during the online booking process, say they are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age 65 and older&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Have a health condition that could make someone at higher risk from COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what counts as “high risk”? To find out if you or a family member might qualify, you can consult &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html"&gt;the CDC’s current list of health conditions&lt;/a&gt; that potentially put you at higher risk of severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19, which includes cancer, chronic lung, kidney and liver disease and certain disabilities. However, it also encompasses other factors like mental health conditions — including depression — obesity and being a current or former smoker.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When listing some of these conditions, CVS’s online appointment also suggests “any other conditions or situations that place you at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (consult your pharmacist or medical provider if you need help).”&lt;/p&gt;

            A school-age child in Los Angeles County who had measles as an infant has died of a rare complication, the county health department said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600053b6q3x6tc176@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The child was infected before they were eligible to receive the measles vaccine, the agency says; the first vaccination is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; between 12 months and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between ages 4 and 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600063b6q4j4n8gy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They recovered from that infection but developed a condition called subacute sclerosing panenecephalitis, which affects about 1 in 10,000 unvaccinated people who get measles overall but up to 1 in 600 of those who catch the virus in infancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600073b6qyeur2xil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;SSPE&lt;/a&gt;, as the complication is also known, develops years after measles infection and can cause changes in personality or behavior, problems with speech and motor functions, and epilepsy, followed by a vegetative state. There’s no cure, and it’s fatal in about 95% of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp6000b3b6qw53g0esd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States has had 1,454 measles cases this year, more than at any other point since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600083b6q6iizuybt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that the child’s case is “a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600093b6q9mxcsj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine are highly effective against measles, preventing 97% of infections. Experts recommend that at least 95% of a community be vaccinated to prevent the disease’s spread, but immunization rates have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/health/vaccine-preventable-diseases-pertussis-polio"&gt;falling&lt;/a&gt; across the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp6000a3b6q597efcj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Infants younger than six months are too young to be vaccinated and rely on maternal antibodies and community immunity to reduce their risk of exposure,” the Los Angeles County Health Department said in the statement. “By getting vaccinated, individuals not only protect themselves but also help shield vulnerable populations — including infants, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems — from measles infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Jason Mitton wanted one of the new COVID-19 vaccines before leaving on a business trip. But the pharmacists at a drug store near his home in Austin, Texas, refused.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He's like: 'Do you have a doctor's note?' I said: 'No, I don't.' He said: 'Well, the FDA standards say that you don't qualify. And our policy is that we won't administer it unless you qualify,'" says Mitton. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mitton, who's 55 and says he has high blood pressure and high cholesterol that's controlled by medication, plans to keep trying to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's ridiculous," Mitton says. "I think it should be a person's right to get the vaccine or not. So I'm very angry."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The same goes for Cheryl Huges, 64, who lives outside Cleveland. She was planning to get another shot as soon as the updated versions became available. But, she's not eligible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm furious," says Hughes. "Who wants to get sick?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For the first time, COVID vaccines aren't available to anyone ages 6 months and older to obtain simply by walking into a pharmacy and asking to get inoculated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a major departure, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;only approved the shots&lt;/a&gt; for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID because they're at least 65 years old or have another health issue that makes them highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration health officials argue that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many Americans who don't meet the new criteria do still want to get vaccinated to avoid getting sick or spreading the virus to vulnerable family members.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And independent medical organizations like the Infectious Disease Society of America argue that &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/fdas-narrow-covid-19-vaccine-label-ignores-science-and-puts-millions-of-lives-at-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;everyone should have the option&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated because there is convincing evidence that the vaccines reduce the risk of serious complications, including hospitalization and death, even for people who are otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Hughes wants to remain healthy so she can care for her husband, who has dementia. She's his only caretaker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If I get sick, my husband might have to go into a care facility. I could lose my job. It would be terrible," Hughes says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What it takes to get the shot&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Secretary Kennedy has repeatedly claimed the new rules won't prevent anyone from getting vaccinated if they want to.  But many people have told NPR that they are having trouble. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In principle, you can still get vaccinated if you meet the criteria, get a doctor to prescribe a shot, or if you "self attest" that you're eligible by telling the pharmacist you meet the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But sometimes people are turned away because supplies of the reformulated shots haven't arrived yet. Sometimes it's because they didn't meet the new criteria. Or they're told they can get a shot if they get a prescription first, only to be inexplicably rejected anyway when they return with a doctor's order.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people describe hunting for a shot from pharmacy to pharmacy and doctor's office to doctor's office — even sometimes seeking one out of state.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The companies that make the shots, Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax, didn't say exactly how many doses they were making this year, given the narrower FDA approvals. But Pfizer says it is preparing "similar volumes" as last year, and that it's confident it will meet demand. It also says millions of doses have already shipped.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Claire Hannan, &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/claire-hannan/" target="_blank"&gt;the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;, says she doesn't expect vaccine supply to be a problem. She says pharmacies are able to order the COVID shots and they've been shipped out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's going to be harder to access," she says. "But I think anybody that wants it, you know, will be able to get it. But they're just going to have to work hard to find it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some clinics and pharmacies haven't received the supplies they've ordered yet. And some doctors' offices, including pediatricians, and clinics may decide not to stock the shots this year if they don't expect enough demand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you're trying to find one, Pfizer and &lt;a href="https://products.modernatx.com/finder" target="_blank"&gt;Moderna &lt;/a&gt;both have &lt;a href="https://www.vaxassist.com/schedule?cmp=188442362390&amp;amp;utm_source=GOOGLE&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;amp;pid=Scheduler&amp;amp;utm_term=pfizer%20vaccine%20available%20near%20me&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22943851190&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABK5w6FawaR8GMs9_iPQ0cImTHd-Y&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5onGBhDeARIsAFK6QJYqqC3A_jZAbNDWf_hifoXY60dX6YR_LiYEEicIdMfLaYWnOJpbL7gaAruoEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine-finder websites&lt;/a&gt; up and running.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Waiting for the CDC's guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major snag is that pharmacists in some states are prohibited from administering the shots until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues specific recommendations for who should get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In past years, those recommendations came in the spring. But Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the entire &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;, the independent group that formulates those recommendations, and replaced the members with his own advisers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's new committee is finally scheduled to meet next week about the COVID vaccines and other issues. That could alleviate some of the problems, including hesitancy that some pharmacists and doctors have because of the changing rules and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it remains unclear what the advisers will do. They could make it easier, or harder, for people to get a shot. Many of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee" target="_blank"&gt;committee's new members&lt;/a&gt; share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Either way, until the committee meeting happens, the shots that are part of the Vaccines for Children Program won't ship, says Hannan, who explained that people haven't been able to order them yet. About half of kids in the U.S. are eligible for free vaccines through the program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health insurance coverage could also prove tricky. Although Aetna and United Healthcare told NPR they will cover the COVID shot with no cost sharing for people with fully insured plans — even for people outside the FDA's narrower approval — it's not clear what other insurance companies will do. And even people who have Aetna or United could have other kinds&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of plans that don't cover the shot, which could set patients back around $200.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Fears for vulnerable family members, kids&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, many Americans have been scrambling to try to figure out how to still get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm very angry, frustrated," says Allison Cote, 32, of Bristol, Conn.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cote wants to stay well to protect her father, who has heart failure, other family members who have diabetes, and one relative who recently got a kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's also concerned about her 16-month-old son. He's not eligible to get vaccinated either this year, even though COVID can be very dangerous for babies. The new shots are only approved for children who have conditions that put them at high risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In fact, the CDC this spring &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;dropped recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that children and pregnant women routinely get vaccinated. For children, the agency recommends parents talk to their doctors first about vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just really upsetting," Cote says. "Why do I have to jump through hoops to do this? It's kind of scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If she has to, Cote says she may do what some people are doing: just say she's eligible. But she doesn't feel great about that. And she has no idea how to get a shot for her baby boy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's hard to watch this play out and know that there are so many lives at risk — and potentially my son's life is at risk too," Cote says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stephan Neidenbach, 45, a public school teacher from Annapolis, Md., is frustrated and angry too. He's worried about getting sick and spreading the virus to his students, his elderly parents or his mother-in-law, who has lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would feel horrible if I did get it and if I passed it off to someone that I cared about. It's terrifying," Neidenbach says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's considering fibbing about his eligibility to get a shot too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Therese McRae, 37, of Sandy, Utah, also wants to get vaccinated. Her main motivation is to protect her 4-year-old daughter, who has Type 1 diabetes, which puts her at risk for serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Being a parent of a young child with a complex medical diagnosis is hard enough," McRae says. "Having folks around her not being able to be vaccinated increases her risk. It's just very overwhelming. It's scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karen Lambey, 43, who lives near Richmond, Va., desperately wants a vaccine too. She says she became immunocompromised after developing long COVID. Her pharmacist told her she needed a prescription to get the shot and she hasn't been able to find a doctor to give her one.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Any sort of flu, COVID, would set me back significantly," Lambey says. "These are all extra hurdles that keep adding up. I feel disappointed because this is something that is important to my health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And Lambey's parents are immune compromised too. She's afraid of spreading the virus to them. "That could potentially be life-threatening for them," she says. "I couldn't live with that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; shines a spotlight on magnesium, a mineral your body needs for many vital functions. Researchers found that adults with signs of magnesium depletion were more likely to experience OAB symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since magnesium is essential for muscle relaxation and nerve signaling, the findings add to growing evidence that this nutrient may play a role in bladder health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study analyzed data from 28,621 adults ages 20 to 80 who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2018. OAB was identified through questionnaires asking about urgency, frequency, nighttime urination and leakage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of relying on single blood tests or diet recalls, researchers used a magnesium depletion score (MgDS), which combines four factors that influence magnesium levels: diuretic use, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, kidney function and heavy alcohol consumption. Participants were then categorized into low, middle or high magnesium depletion groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People with higher magnesium depletion scores were more likely to have OAB. Each one-point increase in MgDS was linked with a 9% higher chance of OAB. Compared with those in the low MgDS group, people in the middle group had 17% higher odds of OAB, and those in the high group had 20% higher odds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The association was strongest among women, adults ages 40 to 60, people with obesity, and non-smokers. Researchers suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-11740104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; may increase bladder muscle excitability and promote inflammation, both of which can trigger urgency and frequency.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, the study has important limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, it cannot prove that low magnesium causes OAB—only that the two are linked. OAB was self-reported, which may introduce bias, and magnesium status was estimated rather than directly measured. More research, especially long-term studies and clinical trials, will be needed to confirm these results.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even with these caveats, the study points toward a simple, food-first approach: make sure you’re getting enough magnesium. Adults need between &lt;strong&gt;310 and 420 milligrams per day&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on age and sex, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many Americans fall short of these levels.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is abundant in everyday foods, especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based staples&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/strong&gt;, like spinach and Swiss chard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legumes&lt;/strong&gt;, such as black beans, lentils, and chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly almonds, cashews and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-underrated-food-to-increase-your-magnesium-intake-11756166" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you suspect you’re not meeting your magnesium needs, talk with your healthcare provider about testing your levels or considering a supplement. But for most people, dietary improvements are a safe and effective first step.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study using national survey data suggests that magnesium deficiency is linked with a greater risk of overactive bladder, particularly among women and people with obesity. While more research is needed to prove cause and effect, eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-rich-foods-11772823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like leafy greens, beans, nuts and whole grains can help you meet daily requirements and may support better bladder health along the way.&lt;br&gt;
