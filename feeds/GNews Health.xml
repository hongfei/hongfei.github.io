			&lt;p&gt;The link between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174214" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia is becoming increasingly clear. New research shows how blood sugar problems affect brain health and vice versa. Here are ten evidence-based insights into how the two conditions are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Diabetes raises the risk of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes are about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4722942/"&gt;60% more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia than those without, and frequent episodes of low blood sugar are linked to a 50% higher chance of cognitive &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-024-01346-4"&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Insulin resistance affects the brain too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance – the major cause of type 2 diabetes – happens when cells stop responding properly to insulin. This means that too much sugar, in the form of glucose, is left in the blood, leading to complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-signal-of-dementia-could-be-hidden-in-how-we-read-faces"&gt;An Early Signal of Dementia Could Be Hidden in How We Read Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually affects the liver and muscles, but it also affects the brain. In  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="174214" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, this resistance may make it harder for brain cells to use glucose for energy, contributing to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4351418/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. A brain sugar shortage in dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is only 2% of our body weight, but uses about 20% of the body's energy. In dementia, brain cells appear to lose the ability to use glucose &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7948516/"&gt;properly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mix of poor use of glucose and insulin resistance is sometimes unofficially called &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/diabetes-and-dementia-risk/"&gt;type 3 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174225" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book.jpg" alt="Woman with Diabetes Wearing a CGM Device on Her Arm Reading a Book" class="size-full wp-image-174225" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174225" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent episodes of low blood sugar are linked to a 50% higher chance of cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's can raise diabetes risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's often have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2993007/#abstract1"&gt;higher fasting blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, even if they don't have diabetes. This is a form of pre-diabetes. Animal studies also show that Alzheimer's-like changes in the brain &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-016-3960-1"&gt;raise blood glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the highest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's, the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; genetic variant, reduces insulin sensitivity by &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/references/S0896-6273(17)30791-2"&gt;trapping the insulin receptor inside the cell&lt;/a&gt;, where it cannot be switched on properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Blood vessel damage links both conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes damages blood vessels, causing complications in the eyes, kidneys and heart. The brain is also at risk. High or varying blood glucose levels can injure vessels in the brain, reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes can also weaken the brain's protective barrier, letting harmful substances in. This leads to inflammation. Reduced blood flow and brain inflammation are strongly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6571853/"&gt;linked to dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Memantine: a dementia drug born from diabetes research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memantine, used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's symptoms, was originally developed as a diabetes medication. It didn't succeed in controlling blood glucose, but researchers later discovered its benefits for &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14656566.2011.558006"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;. This story shows how diabetes research may hold clues for treating brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Metformin might protect the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin, the most widely used diabetes drug, does more than just lower blood glucose. It gets into the brain and may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40710317/"&gt;lower brain inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that people with diabetes who take metformin are less likely to develop dementia, and those who stop taking it may see their &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810994"&gt;risk increase again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials are testing its effects in people &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40434891/"&gt;without diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Weight-loss injections may reduce plaque buildup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs, such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), lower blood glucose and support weight loss. Records show that people with diabetes on these drugs have a lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing GLP-1 drugs to metformin, studies have found that they were even &lt;a href="https://drc.bmj.com/content/13/4/e004902"&gt;more effective than metformin&lt;/a&gt; at reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two major trials, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39780249/"&gt;Evoke and Evoke Plus&lt;/a&gt;, are testing oral semaglutide in people with mild cognitive impairment or early mild Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174227" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection.jpg" alt="Person's Hands Preparing Semaglutide Injection" class="size-full wp-image-174227" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174227" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with diabetes on GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs have a lower dementia risk. (imyskin/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Insulin therapy might help the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since insulin resistance in the brain is a problem, researchers have tested insulin sprays given through the nose. This method delivers insulin straight to the brain while reducing effects on blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small studies suggest these sprays &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/1107947"&gt;may help memory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34101779/"&gt;reduce brain shrinkage&lt;/a&gt;, but delivery methods remain a challenge. Sprays vary in how much insulin reaches the brain, and long-term safety has not yet been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. SGLT2 inhibitors may lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence suggests that compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, (a type of diabetes drug) are superior at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1262363625000187"&gt;reducing dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, including Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, in people with type 2 diabetes. These tablets lower blood sugar by increasing sugar removal in urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study builds on early evidence suggesting they lower dementia risk by &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209805"&gt;reducing inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This growing body of evidence suggests that managing diabetes protects more than the heart and kidneys, it also helps preserve brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions remain whether diabetes drugs only reduce the diabetes-associated dementia risk or whether these drugs could also reduce risk in people without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, diabetes research has been very successful in creating at least 13 different classes of drugs, multiple combination therapies, giving rise to at least 50 different medicines. These reduce blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 'side effect' may be better preservation of brain health during ageing.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264393/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Whether you’re catching up on messages, watching videos, reading the news, or just passing the time, the bathroom ritual often doubles as a digital break, as the toilet becomes a mini escape from the world. On the surface, it feels harmless – a few extra minutes here and there. But emerging research suggests this convenience could carry hidden risks to health – especially in the digestive, anal, and pelvic areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in PLOS One by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston found that adults who use smartphones on the toilet have a 46% higher risk of hemorrhoids than those who don’t. Why? Because using a phone tends to prolong the time spent on the toilet, it increases pressure in the rectal veins. That alone may explain much of the risk. What drives this risk? Mainly, increased time sitting on the toilet (especially more than 5 minutes per visit), more pressure on anal and rectal veins, reduced physical activity, and distraction leading to poor habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s just one of several problems being connected to this modern bathroom behaviour. From infections to pelvic damage, posture issues to digestive trouble, using your phone during bathroom visits might be doing more harm than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we explore seven specific health conditions or risks linked with phone use on the toilet. We discuss what recent studies show, how each condition develops, and simple changes you can make to avoid becoming vulnerable. Even if you don’t bring your phone into the bathroom, some of these risks apply to prolonged sitting. Learning these can help you make smarter choices about when and how to use your phone — especially in your most private moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are several health conditions that are (or may be) linked to this particular bathroom habit, how the phone-on-toilet behavior contributes, and what you can do to reduce the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 01:12:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>澳大利亚批准接种疫苗以保护考拉免受衣原体感染- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5541358/australia-koala-chlamydia-vaccine</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A vaccine has been approved to help protect koalas against chlamydia, a measure researchers are hailing as a world-first in fighting the disease that is a leading cause of death for the beloved marsupials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia said Wednesday it took more than 10 years to develop a single-dose vaccine that does not require a booster that it hopes will aid in "reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in South East Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50 percent and in some cases can reach as high as 70 percent," Peter Timms, a microbiology professor at the university who led the research team, &lt;a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/about/unisc-news/news-archive/2025/september/world-first-unisc-s-koala-vaccine-approved-to-fight-deadly-disease" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Chlamydia in koalas can cause blindness and lead them to starve to death because they cannot locate trees to climb for food, &lt;a href="https://koalaconservationaustralia.org.au/pages/disease" target="_blank"&gt;according to Koala Conservation Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It can also cause infertility and damage a koala's bladder to the point where the inner wall becomes inflamed and the marsupial passes blood, the organization said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The disease occurs in koalas multiple ways, including through mating, infected discharges and at birth. Baby koalas, known as joeys, can also catch chlamydia by eating pap, a substance produced by a mother that's similar to feces, if their mother is infected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics have been used to treat the disease but it is not always effective and does not prevent future infections, according to the university. Antibiotics can also lead to gastrointestinal side effects that could hinder koalas' ability to digest eucalyptus leaves, which are the animals' main food source. Depending on the severity of the chlamydia and if it has progressed too far, euthanasia may be an only option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why scientists are optimistic about the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sam Phillips, a senior researcher at the UniSC, said the vaccine has been tested on hundreds of wild koalas and koalas in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's based on Chlamydia pecorum's major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and offers three levels of protection – reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and, in some cases, reversing existing symptoms," Phillips said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The study led by Phillips &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00938-5" target="_blank"&gt;that published last year&lt;/a&gt; found that the vaccine reduced signs of chlamydia during a koala's breeding age and decreased death from the disease by 64%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The university said the vaccine has been approved for production and widespread use by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The agency told NPR it approved a permit authorizing use of the vaccine in koalas in June that runs through June 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

They were heading into deep water and coming back with big, fast fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic boats and ropes usually rot away, so direct proof is rare. What survives are tools, fish bones, and clues in microscopic wear on stone edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riczar Fuentes of &lt;a href="https://www.ateneo.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ateneo de Manila University&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues focus on what stone tools reveal about plant processing and boat work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach links tool wear and plant fibers to practical needs like rope, nets, and bindings for watercraft and in a recent publication, they argued that a web of indirect signs can confirm real maritime skill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The identification of boat building materials through direct or indirect evidence is vital in understanding movements across and within island environments,” wrote Fuentes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same stone tools carry tiny traces that point to fiber extraction. Those fibers become cordage, lines, and netting strong enough for boat seams and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-third-of-shark-species-face-extinction-despite-fishing-bans/"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of tracing work has a name. Researchers call it traceology, a method that reads microscopic wear to reconstruct how a tool was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-seafaring-this-early-matters"&gt;Why seafaring this early matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossing channels between islands takes planning, timing, and control. Drifting on rafts would not explain repeated arrivals in specific places over long spans of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region in question is Island Southeast Asia, a sprawl of land and sea that demanded reliable water travel. Within it sits Wallacea, the chain of islands between Asia and Australia that always required open-water crossings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists now think people here were more than lucky passengers on currents. The tool evidence suggests deliberate building, organized labor, and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of know-how changes how we picture daily life. It also explains how communities kept moving, trading, and adapting across thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hooks-sharks-and-tuna-at-jerimalai"&gt;Hooks, sharks, and tuna at Jerimalai&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here we report remains of a variety of pelagic and other fish species dating to 42,000 years before the present,” wrote Sue O’Connor from Australian National University, in a &lt;a href="https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstreams/395b3624-7aba-44e8-ae54-08a923e67615/download"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; describing the fish record and early gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study documents the earliest known shell fishhooks at Jerimalai, a rock shelter on Timor-Leste’s coast dated between about 23,000 and 16,000 years ago. These are small, precise tools that speak to careful crafting and targeted fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bone counts are not trivial. The team identified 38,687 fish bones from 2,843 individual fish. Crucially, the assemblage includes remains of pelagic species that live in deeper water beyond reefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-timor-to-the-philippines"&gt;From Timor to the Philippines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timor-Leste is only part of the picture. A broad record from the Philippines now shows long-term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ice-age-art-discovery-reveals-15800-year-old-fishing-secrets/"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; that spans at least 30,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X23003978"&gt;Work&lt;/a&gt; in Mindoro’s caves adds detail on how coastal people managed reefs and deeper zones. That study tracked which fish families show up, and when, across changing shorelines and habitats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These finds tie into plant fibers and tool wear in the same region. The combined record points to people who planned, built, and fished with skill, not luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns like these do not appear once and vanish. They persist, which suggests teaching, apprenticeship, and shared practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-boats-came-together"&gt;How boats came together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood planks, sewn edges, and lashings would have relied on sturdy plant fibers. The tool traces match steps needed to strip, twist, and finish those fibers into ropes and lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61839-w"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that making string is not a recent trick, citing evidence that short fibres fragment from Abri du Maras in France records twisted plant strands more than 40,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean people in Europe and Southeast Asia did the same thing in the same way. It shows that fiber technology was within the reach of human hands and minds wherever materials allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people could twist string, they could weave nets, lash boat parts, and make lines. That opens the door to deep-water travel and targeted fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-migration-across-islands"&gt;Rethinking migration across islands&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obsidian moving between islands in southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste points to sustained contact. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440316301613"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; fits a late Pleistocene to early Holocene interaction zone rather than one-off drifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone does not sail itself, and it does not walk across channels. Its movement reflects planned trips, return journeys, and social ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those ties likely included sharing routes and seasons. You do not reach a tuna run by guessing, you reach it by knowledge passed along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As knowledge spreads, technology improves. Better ropes, better lines, and better boats raise the odds of a safe return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-changes-the-story-we-tell"&gt;Why this changes the story we tell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, scholars looked for the earliest big changes in a few famous regions. These finds push us to broaden the map and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, technical skill is not just tool design, it is teamwork. People needed group effort to build, carry, launch, and maintain boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not teamwork alone, it is also about logistics. Fibers must be harvested, processed, and stored, and repairs must be made fast when seawater and sun wear things down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-fish-bones-reveal-clues-about-the-evolution-of-eating/"&gt;fish bones&lt;/a&gt;, the hooks, and the traces on stone tools point to a culture that understood the sea. The work looks careful, repeatable, and tied to seasons and migrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-remains-to-figure-out"&gt;What remains to figure out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boats do not preserve well, so many details will stay hidden. Even so, the indirect signs add up and form a consistent picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future experiments can test which plants, tools, and fiber twists hold up under load. Those trials can feed back into the archaeological read on use wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More underwater and coastal work could reveal net weights, sinkers, or preserved cord in unusual conditions. Every new fragment can lock one more piece into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of this, one message stands firm. People in Island Southeast Asia were organized and capable on the water far earlier than many assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X25000525?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 23:12:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNQXc3YUU5VVpxSy1nck9id0ZMRmVNM1NoZzZQN0ppRkU5cDRjYlRLSDY1d1BXQ00tNExkU2lVVDlnSjFyYjZ0NDZzak9Ra3JyOFIxWFZEYzhXOWYxSHFYeTZZLVFJQ0FJSGt0SWN5NHZZVUZWdHdKSEJULXZXa0FCV3ZVVkhwbUV5dDN6Z1JTMk9LTDdmQzJmeDhMZkliVlNWd1ZmU2F3SUMtZw</guid></item><item><title>三倍剂量的诺和诺德药物在试验中实现了19%的体重减轻-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/581ef56d-8f25-4f04-8386-74d35de0d755</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FT newspaper delivered Monday-Saturday, plus FT Digital Edition delivered to your device Monday-Saturday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 22:30:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE05Q3BfeTR0MlRIclRta3pud3RFV29fSnhNQ3dlUEJ6X3lhU1ZrSUpPeXRLNzA1SXkyckxCTXNIUG12dzFtQl9JWEdiN1NSdWJ3Y0hleFAwdkRjc2t2eFpzaUhsWk1WN3pHWDJXNEhOaXo</guid></item><item><title>大麻使用与患2型糖尿病的风险增加两倍，研究发现超过400万成年人- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-cannabis-quadrupled-diabetes-million-adults.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use is linked to an almost quadrupling in the risk of developing diabetes, according to an analysis of real-world data from over 4 million adults, being presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (&lt;a href="https://www.easd.org/annual-meeting/easd-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;EASD&lt;/a&gt;) held in Vienna, Austria (15–19 Sept).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Cannabis use is increasing globally with an estimated 219 million users (4.3% of the global adult population) in 2021, but its long-term metabolic effects remain unknown. While some studies have suggested potential anti-inflammatory or weight management properties, others have raised concerns regarding glucose metabolism and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and the magnitude of the risk of developing diabetes hasn't been clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the evidence base, Dr. Ibrahim Kamel from the Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts, U.S. and colleagues analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from 54 health care organizations (TriNetX Research Network, with centers from across U.S. and Europe) to identify 96,795 outpatients (aged between 18 and 50 years, 52.5% female) with cannabis-related diagnoses (ranging from occasional use to dependence, including cases of intoxication and withdrawal) between 2010 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were matched with 4,160,998 healthy individuals (with no record of substance use or major chronic conditions) based on age, sex, and underlying illnesses at the start of the study, and followed for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After controlling HDL and LDL cholesterol, uncontrolled high blood pressure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cocaine use, alcohol use and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%), with statistical analysis showing cannabis users at nearly four times the risk of developing diabetes compared to non-users.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;While the authors note that more research is needed to fully explain the association between cannabis and diabetes, it may come down to insulin resistance and unhealthy dietary behaviors. Nevertheless, the study's results have immediate implications for metabolic monitoring practices and public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted and legalized in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks," said lead author Dr. Kamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These new sights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counseling, as well as the need for health care professionals to routinely talk to patients about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the important findings, this is a retrospective study and cannot prove that cannabis use causes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced the results despite efforts to reduce confounding bias via propensity score matching. This study has limitations due to a lack of detailed cannabis consumption data and potential misclassification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that the inherent limitations of real-world data often result from inconsistent patient reporting in electronic medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also note that there is a risk of bias because of imprecise measures of cannabis exposure and the reliance on participants to accurately report any cannabis use, even when they lived in places where the drug is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

However, some seasons are longer than others, and there can be higher levels of the flu circulating as late as May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-too-early-for-a-flu-shot" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Is it too early for a flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doctors generally agree that right now is too early for a flu shot. “The concern is that the protection will wane,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Schaffner, M.D.," data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “If you can wait a bit, that’s better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Infectious disease expert &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amesh A.

Adalja, M.D., &lt;/a&gt;senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. “The influenza season can last into mid-spring,” he points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The only people who may benefit from getting vaccinated now are children under the age of 8 who have never had a flu shot, Dr. Schaffner says. “They will need two doses, spaced apart, so you can get it now and then later,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-my-flu-vaccine-options" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;What are my flu vaccine options?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You have a few choices when it comes to getting vaccinated against the flu. Most Americans under the age of 65 who get the flu shot will get a trivalent vaccine, which targets three strains of the flu, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s recommended that adults 65 and up get a quadrivalent flu vaccine, which targets four strains of the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are variations within those types of vaccines, including flu shots that are egg-free, if you prefer one of those. You also have the option of getting a nasal flu vaccine called FluMist, which is sprayed into your nose, bypassing the needle altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-get-a-flu-shot" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;When is the best time to get a flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s hard to figure out an exact time to get your shot. However, the CDC usually &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommends" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting your shot by Halloween, aka the end of October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“October is when I recommend getting the vaccine as there is more actual influenza activity then—there is very little now,” Dr. Adalja says. “The vaccine will last further into the season if administered in October.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Also worth considering: It takes about two weeks after you’re vaccinated for your body to develop antibodies against the flu, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you have a big indoor event coming up sometime in late October or November, you may want to plan to get your flu vaccine a few weeks ahead of that, just to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But if now is the only time you can get vaccinated, Dr. Adalja says it’s better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-does-flu-shot-protection-last" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;How long does flu shot protection last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s hard to put an exact number on how long protection from your flu shot will last. Everyone has different factors that influence this, including your own immune system, Dr. Schaffner says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But there is a general range you can expect. “The flu vaccine typically provides protection for about six to eight months,” says &lt;a href="https://nursing.buffalo.edu/additional-info/faculty-and-staff/faculty_directory.host.html/content/shared/nursing/faculty-and-staff-directory/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/haas-melinda.detail.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.buffalo.edu/additional-info/faculty-and-staff/faculty_directory.host.html/content/shared/nursing/faculty-and-staff-directory/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/haas-melinda.detail.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Melinda Haas, D.N.P" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Melinda Haas, D.N.P&lt;/a&gt;., clinical assistant professor at the University at Buffalo School of Nursing. “However, it’s important to note that this can vary depending on individual factors and the specific strains of the flu virus in a given season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, doctors stress the importance of getting your flu vaccine. “Flu vaccination is best thought of as a way of increasing your resilience to respiratory virus season,” Dr. Adalja says. “It is an important tool to help you avoid the disruptive and serious consequences of influenza infection.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 20:15:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5qOGc2SmQ5YXE4WTZFT2h2ZFpqbFpSTGRRTnlkYnhXUVBiRy0yQ2RQTkowdmx3RDJlM0pocWhuZ2tyWjZpUHQxTEZmUmFRNkl0ZWhVbE15dG1EbURkUlVIbGo2bllsRm5LNDhIZkZZV1R2NTNOOFE</guid></item><item><title>埃博拉疫苗接种在刚果南部开始- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/world/africa/ebola-vaccination-begins-southern-congo-rcna231173</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43e172" class="body-graf"&gt;LAGOS, Nigeria — Vaccination for those exposed to the Ebola virus and front-line health workers has begun in southern Kasai province, the World Health Organization said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b4a394" class="body-graf"&gt;An outbreak of the highly contagious disease &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593"&gt;was announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month in the locality of Bulape, in Kasai, and has left at least 16 dead and 68 suspected cases, according to last week’s briefing by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62294c" class="body-graf"&gt;Only an initial 400 doses of the Ervebo vaccine have been dispatched, with the rest to be delivered later, the WHO said.

			&lt;p&gt;A new longitudinal study by an international team of researchers has found a link between eating breakfast later in the day and a greater chance of an early death among elderly people, raising questions about the relationship between mealtimes and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just the food we eat that affects our body's health and well-being; the time we eat our meals is also known to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039373"&gt;affect our body's functioning&lt;/a&gt;. Yet our body's condition can also determine when we may be craving a bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 2,945 adults living in Newcastle and Manchester, UK, were collected between 1983 and 2017. The participants were aged between 42 and 94 when they signed up, and information was collected through optional questionnaires on their health, lifestyle, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;eating habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-one-crucial-protein-appears-to-reverse-brain-aging-in-mice"&gt;Switching Off One Crucial Protein Appears to Reverse Brain Aging in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics revealed the volunteers tended to eat breakfast and dinner later in the day as they aged, extending their daily eating over a smaller window of time, too. These later eating times were linked to poorer physical and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-2-key-lifestyle-changes-can-treat-mild-depression-as-well-as-therapy"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to all-cause mortality – the likelihood of dying for any reason – the researchers found a significant link between eating breakfast later and a higher mortality risk. For each hour later that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/kids-who-eat-breakfast-every-day-share-something-in-common"&gt;breakfast was taken&lt;/a&gt;, the chance of dying during the study period went up 8-11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutrition scientist Hassan Dashti, from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173208" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart.jpg" alt="Eating chart" class="wp-image-173208 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart-582x415.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173208" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked eating times as people got older.

Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't saying that eating breakfast later is going to cause you to die at an earlier age – or that shifting your breakfast time forward a few hours will guarantee you get &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;an extra few years&lt;/a&gt; added on at the end of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they suggest the relationship is likely to be driven in the other direction. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-vitamin-d-slow-aging-a-new-study-says-yes-but-theres-a-catch"&gt;As we get older&lt;/a&gt; and a greater number of health problems mount up, and increase in severity, that means an earlier death is more likely, and also causes later breakfast times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorer health leading to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;lack of sleep&lt;/a&gt; is one way that might play out, with trouble sleeping leading to difficulty getting up. Deteriorating physical health also means most tasks – including making breakfast – take longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way the study findings might be useful is in identifying older people who are more at risk in terms of their health. It also gives us a greater understanding of how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-intermittent-fasting-has-2-key-benefits-for-people-with-obesity"&gt;changes in eating habits&lt;/a&gt; might affect younger people and older people differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heat-waves-can-accelerate-aging-as-much-as-smoking-or-drinking-study-shows"&gt;is aging overall&lt;/a&gt; – meaning a larger proportion of the total number of people on the planet are older – which makes it increasingly important to spot and interpret these kinds of patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, encouraging older adults in having consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promoting healthy aging and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-01035-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Glasses or surgery can usually resolve the problem but many find wearing spectacles inconvenient and having an operation is not an option for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"science","tags":[{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/andrew-gregory","type":"Contributor","title":"Andrew Gregory"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/sep/14/eye-drops-could-replace-glasses-surgery-longsighted-study","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now experts say the solution could be as simple as using eye drops twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A study presented on Sunday at the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) in Copenhagen showed that most people could read extra lines on eye test charts after using the drops. The improvement was sustained for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The treatment could provide a safe and effective alternative for patients who “seek freedom from the inconvenience” of wearing glasses or who are unable or unwilling to access surgery, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The drops contain pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the muscle that controls the shape of the eye’s lens to enable focus on objects at different distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study involved 766 people in Argentina who used the drops twice a day, upon waking and about six hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They were divided into three groups, receiving different formulations. Each of the drops had a fixed dose of diclofenac, but the concentration of pilocarpine varied between 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the 148 given the 1% drops, almost all were able to read two or more extra lines on the chart. In the 2% group, 69% of the 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines, and in the 3% group, 84% of the 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, the director of the Centre for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Buenos Aires, said: “Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines [the measurement used for testing near visual acuity]. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings suggest the therapy “offers a safe, effective and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management”, Benozzi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Common side-effects were temporary dim vision, irritation when the drops were administered, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts welcomed the findings and called for more research. Prof Burkhard Dick, the president-elect of ESCRS, said: “Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 18:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOTzg2amhVYjUycFlPOVpLWEk5NW1WZHpHMGp5cWlJWm55bXVUSXJwVW5lNnhhTkV0bFgxWW9xQm15Qk5EbFI4SW50N1FvUlJoRGNBTUxYbUQwdG9RQXkxbDhVUDh2eVdzZU12ZTIxTlZJSUViZEJfMTBYUHVtZFB5NENrdlZJNFZ6aUQzOE5nV25kTFFySGg3WjdrOUV0WklDcE1hZUppOTg</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年9月14日-每日科斯</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/14/2339914/-Infectious-Updates-9-14-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;DR Congo &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/dr-congo-declares-ebola-outbreak-kasai-province" target="_blank"&gt;declares another Ebola outbreak.&lt;/a&gt;  More &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/who-shares-more-dr-congo-ebola-outbreak-details-more-suspected-cases-reported" target="_blank"&gt;details emerge.&lt;/a&gt;  Suspected cases &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/suspected-cases-dr-congo-ebola-outbreak-rise-68" target="_blank"&gt;have risen to 68,&lt;/a&gt;  and more regions are involved.  This is a new zoonotic spillover, not related to previous outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mpox &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/hot-spots-shift-africa-s-mpox-battle-cholera-activity-spikes-chad-and-republic-congo" target="_blank"&gt;Continues to be a problem for Africa&lt;/a&gt;, as the rest of the world winds down its health emergency.  Also, cholera is a severe problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previously stored sample from a CA dairy herd &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/earlier-h5n1-detection-adds-texas-dairy-herd-total-researchers-cant" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for H5N1,&lt;/a&gt; but no new detections have occurred in cattle in the last 30 days.  A turkey farm has been hit, the second recent detection in South Dakota.  Avian flu &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cdc-says-avian-flu-may-infect-gut-though-risk-low" target="_blank"&gt;may infect the gut, though the risk is considered low.&lt;/a&gt;  Seems clear to me that pets infected by raw foods got it that way, not by breathing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In related developments, a multisector group made up of experts in poultry, public health, science, and policy is meeting for the first time this week in Brazil to address the escalating avian flu threat to animal health, human health, and livelihoods, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/avian-influenza--first-global-dialogue-targets-the-rising-pandemic-threat/en" target="_blank"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. The group called the response unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avian flu is now a global challenge, not a sporadic threat, Beth Bechdol, MS, the FAO's deputy director-general, said in a statement, "No single country or sector can tackle this threat in isolation—and failure is not an option. Practical, science-based collaboration like this is essential to protect our agrifood systems, livelihoods, and public health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the OTHER bird flus is still causing human cases &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/four-more-h9n2-avian-flu-cases-confirmed-china" target="_blank"&gt;In China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was measles exposure &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/09/09/repub/utah-health-officials-warn-of-measles-exposure-at-large-cycling-event/?emci=19ddf5c1-ca8d-f011-b484-6045bdeb7413&amp;amp;emdi=86e572af-3d8e-f011-b484-6045bdeb7413&amp;amp;ceid=491687" target="_blank"&gt;At a large cycling event in Utah.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sad reminder that measles can kill years later: an LA child &lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/la-county-confirms-childs-death-late-measles-complication" target="_blank"&gt;Who caught measles as an infant&lt;/a&gt; has died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare and fatal sequel of measles that occurs 10 or more years after the original infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are stepping up &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/minnesota-new-york-issue-executive-orders-promoting-access-covid-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;To secure vaccine access for their citizens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New studies show &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/studies-show-how-common-long-covid-globally-and-teens" target="_blank"&gt;just how prevalent long Covid is.&lt;/a&gt;  To be avoided if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you might give &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/dogs-exposed-covid-positive-people-show-increased-risk-infection" target="_blank"&gt;Covid to your dog&lt;/a&gt;, who really doesn't deserve it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy full term infants are also &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv/severe-rsv-doesnt-spare-healthy-full-term-infants-data-suggest" target="_blank"&gt;at risk of severe RSV illness&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the need for maternal and infant vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salmonella in delivered meals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has posted a notice about a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Enteritidis outbreak linked to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/homedeliverymeals-09-25/investigation.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;meals from Metabolic Meals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a home delivery company. So far, at least 16 people in 10 states have been sickened, with 7 people requiring hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the odd diseases corner we have N. meningitidis eye infections &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/report-describes-n-meningitidis-conjunctivitis-outbreak-us-military-base" target="_blank"&gt;on a military base.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/borealpox/six-recent-sporadic-borealpox-cases-alaska-tied-rodents" target="_blank"&gt;Boreal pox in Alaska,&lt;/a&gt; which is spread from rodents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multidrug resistant &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/candida-auris/multidrug-resistant-yeast-cases-rising-rapidly-europe-survey-shows" target="_blank"&gt;Candidiasis in European hospitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Jamestown Canyon virus, first human case &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/vermont-reports-its-first-human-jamestown-canyon-case" target="_blank"&gt;In Vermont.&lt;/a&gt;  No, I never heard of it before either.  It's spread by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voluntary recall of some &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/dermarite-industries-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-dermakleen-dermasarra-kleenfoam-and" target="_blank"&gt;DermaRite products&lt;/a&gt; has expanded, due to Burkholderia contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

Each tick feeds on multiple animals throughout its life, absorbing viruses and bacteria along the way and passing them on with its next bite. Some of those viruses and bacteria are harmful to humans, causing diseases that can be debilitating and sometimes lethal without treatment, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lyme&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24809-babesiosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24809-babesiosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;babesiosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rocky Mountain spotted fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="d6ba3bd8-9871-45c2-a640-2743998b78fb-2"&gt;But contained in every bite of this infuriating, insatiable pest is also a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-abstract/47/5/707/881591" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-abstract/47/5/707/881591" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trove of social, environmental and epidemiological history&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b3025e63-be2a-4eb8-8ccc-3ae1984350d8"&gt;In many cases, human actions long ago are the reason ticks carry these diseases so widely today.

But increasingly, evidence points to another culprit that can harm cardiovascular health. Most of us are not aware and never would have thought that this, could also be the reason of heart attacks that are increasing by the second. Modern foods and lifestyle patterns are quietly undermining the body's capacity for nitric oxide production, a molecule that is essential for keeping blood vessels functional and the heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Berg, a trained wellness expert and best-selling author, warns about how a potential decrease in nitric oxide can significantly lead to heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Beware!

Sometimes, we need to look away from the obvious food items to know what is actually harming our heart and body. Refined sugar, processed starches, industrial seed oils, smoking, and even run-of-the-mill mouthwash can sneakily compromise the body's nitric oxide production capability. This degrades the blood vessels and enhances the risk of cardiovascular disease in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxNa3BZVlFJZmZQd3h5dW9iM29UOUlUekNkcWhhR0F3eU1YVVdOZ19mVXlGZlBKVF9kOGtzdnp0bGJ3VS1CQ2RJSFZyWmluQjFHT1FZbVJtT242N2dJVXdsN016ZGlHNC1KTjN6VG9rTjU1ckV5U0xiWlN5ZG9JbEltUHdJalAyQnk0MlBydGF6bl96Wk1zVHV1cUdkM0RIWERMWi1leGxrNkJYT2NQbnQyLWNLbXRwYWJybjFjeXYwZ3VJVjBCWDlxcVZFbGg3TXlpU2xqNklQcHB5SWZaaWRzTS1KTjVYMjAwSHdLaGVfc19nSUptVFpr</guid></item><item><title>根据科学研究，这种看似无害的饮料以关键的方式加速衰老- valleyvanguardonline.com</title><link>https://www.valleyvanguardonline.com/this-seemingly-harmless-drink-speeds-up-aging-in-a-critical-way-according-to-science/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			&lt;p data-start="90" data-end="459"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="90" data-end="457"&gt;&lt;em data-start="92" data-end="455"&gt;For many of us, it’s the drink we reach for at lunch, during a movie, or when we need a quick burst of energy. It feels refreshing in the moment, but research shows this sweet habit may actually be shaving years off our lives. Scientists warn that one of the world’s most popular beverages doesn’t just damage our health—it accelerates the aging process itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="3757471395" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="90" data-end="459"&gt;&lt;span id="more-3607"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="460" data-end="515"&gt;Premature Aging: The Drink Behind Cellular Decline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="516" data-end="1082"&gt;The culprit? &lt;strong&gt;Soda&lt;/strong&gt;. Beyond the sugar highs and inevitable crashes, sodas have been directly linked to premature cellular aging. A landmark 2014 study published in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em data-start="682" data-end="717"&gt;American Journal of Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; found that people who regularly drank soda had shorter telomeres—protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes. Think of telomeres like the plastic tips on shoelaces; when they wear down, the laces fray. In our bodies, shorter telomeres mean reduced longevity and a higher risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="1083" data-end="1119"&gt;What Scientists Have Discovered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1120" data-end="1566"&gt;Elissa Epel, a professor of psychiatry at the &lt;strong&gt;University of &lt;a href="https://www.valleyvanguardonline.com/neon-blue-wild-pigs-in-california-the-surprising-reason-behind-their-color-change/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco&lt;/strong&gt;, explained in an interview that sugary soda consumption not only overwhelms the body’s ability to regulate sugar but also speeds up cellular aging in multiple tissues. What’s striking is that these effects show up regardless of age, income, ethnicity, or education level. In other words, nobody gets a free pass—soda’s impact on cellular health is universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1567" data-end="1612"&gt;More Than Just Sugar: The Hidden Effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1613" data-end="2011"&gt;Newer research reinforces these findings. A 2021 review in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em data-start="1672" data-end="1699"&gt;Current Nutrition Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; highlighted how sugary drinks disrupt the gut microbiome, fuel chronic inflammation, and increase oxidative stress. These three biological processes are well-known drivers of premature aging. Taken together, they paint a clear picture: soda isn’t just a guilty pleasure, it’s a catalyst for long-term decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2012" data-end="2056"&gt;A Short-Term Pleasure, A Long-Term Cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2057" data-end="2481"&gt;Of course, enjoying a cold soda on a hot day feels harmless—even nostalgic. Many of us grew up associating it with family meals, summer picnics, or celebrations. But as science continues to uncover the hidden costs, nutritionists are urging people to rethink their daily habits. Alternatives like sparkling water with a squeeze of lemon or unsweetened iced tea can deliver the same refreshment without the cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="2855453267" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="2482" data-end="2519"&gt;Think Twice Before Your Next Sip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2520" data-end="2908" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;The occasional soda won’t undo years of healthy living, but making it a regular habit can quietly chip away at your body’s resilience. As researchers remind us, aging is inevitable—but accelerating it through what we drink is not. The next time you find yourself craving that fizzy sweetness, it might be worth pausing to consider: is the momentary satisfaction worth the price of time?&lt;/p&gt;

This common and disabling disease that affects the brain occurs when brain cells are damaged or die, leading to progressive declines in cognitive functions, mood, behavior, and personality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/fact-check-are-heart-attacks-caused-by-bacterial-infections/articleshow/123884019.cms"&gt;Fact check: Are heart attacks caused by bacterial infections?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/kidney-health-best-herbal-teas-for-kidney-support-besides-water-and-supplements/amp_etphotostory/123864389.cms"&gt;Kidney health: Best herbal teas for kidney support besides water and supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 55 million people with dementia worldwide currently, nearly 10 million new cases develop each year. The number of people with dementia is growing worldwide and is expected to triple by 2050. Despite the prevalence of the disabling disease, when most people think of dementia, the first thing that comes to mind is memory loss, like forgetting names, appointments, or where things are. While memory decline is very common, dementia involves much more than that. Early on, there are other changes, subtle signals, that often go unnoticed. These can be changes in behaviour, language, perception, coordination, or mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bing, MD, MPH, a renowned neurologist with over 170K followers on Instagram, says the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers warn that spotting these non-memory signs early can lead to faster diagnosis, better care, and more time to plan. Many dementia types – such as Alzheimer’s, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia – show these symptoms. But because these signs are subtler, they are sometimes ignored or chalked up to stress, age, or mood. That delay in recognizing these non-memory signals means missed opportunities for early treatment, support, and slowing of progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you know what to watch for, you can help yourself or someone you care about get help sooner. Let’s look at 5 non-memory signs of dementia: what they are, how to spot them, which dementia types tend to show them, and when to talk to a doctor. Recognizing these signs is not about fear – it’s about awareness, so that early support, treatment, or lifestyle changes can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在无树岛上意外发现的古老热带雨林- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/pollen-from-ancient-tropical-forest-accidentally-discovered-on-a-treeless-island/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falkland Islands are known today for cool winds, broad grasslands, and very few trees. That modern picture is accurate, but it is not the whole story. Pollen found beneath the capital shows these islands once supported a cool-temperate forest – wet, shaded, and biologically rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clue came from a dark, woody layer uncovered during construction in Stanley. It was not random debris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fossilized-frozen-forest-reveals-climate-impacts-on-ancient-alpine-ecosystems/"&gt;buried forest&lt;/a&gt; bed – plant-heavy sediment preserved in place – holding microscopic grains and real pieces of ancient wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forest-pollen-and-wood-fragments"&gt;Forest pollen and wood fragments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists collected three kinds of evidence: pollen grains, spores, and chunks of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/north-americas-oldest-known-pterosaur-eotephradactylus-mcintireae-discovered-arizona/"&gt;fossilized wood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen and spores keep their species-specific shapes for millions of years when they get trapped in wet sediment and then buried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood fragments preserve internal features that point to the type of tree and the conditions in which it grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This layer is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/lignite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lignitic&lt;/a&gt; – formed as plant material piled up in waterlogged, low-oxygen settings where leaves and twigs do not fully rot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, that mush compressed into a dense, carbon-rich stratum, likely in a shallow, protected basin near the coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-collecting-and-identifying-samples"&gt;Collecting and identifying samples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the discovery, Dr. Zoë Thomas of the &lt;a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/a&gt; hurried to the site with colleagues to salvage fresh samples before they dried and cracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The tree remains were so pristinely preserved they looked like driftwood,” recalled Dr. Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the team separated tiny grains from the sediment and examined them under high magnification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mix showed southern beech (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nothofagus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nothofagus&lt;/a&gt;) and podocarps – Southern Hemisphere conifers – alongside moisture-loving plants that thrive in soggy ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fossil pollen, spores, and wood paint a much different picture of the ancient environment, providing direct evidence of cool, wet forests,” noted Michael Donovan, collections manager at &lt;a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chicago’s Field Museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reading-the-forest-s-pollen-and-wood"&gt;Reading the forest’s pollen and wood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen alone can be misleading because wind can carry it far. That is why the wood matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/giant-trees-never-seen-before-up-to-3000-years-old-tessmannia-princeps-tasmania/"&gt;Wood anatomy&lt;/a&gt; – cell sizes, pits, and rays – helps confirm whether pieces came from conifers or broadleaf trees and whether the community matches the pollen record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, it does. The agreement points to a local forest, not distant pollen that drifted in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern relatives of Nothofagus and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocarpus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;podocarps&lt;/a&gt; form cool, mossy forests in parts of southern Chile and Patagonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their presence in the Falklands’ fossil record supports the idea that the islands once held a wet, shaded habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dating-the-forest-fossils"&gt;Dating the forest fossils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiocarbon dating tops out around 50,000 years, so the team turned to regional comparison. They lined up the Falklands’ pollen ‘cast’ with well-dated South American records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same key pollen types appear and fade in the same order across sites, timelines can be matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those comparisons point to the mid-to-late Cenozoic – tens of millions of years ago – when warmer intervals let rainforests extend to higher latitudes and outlying islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/13202756/ancient-forest_treeless-island_falklands_pollen-discovered_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/13202803/ancient-forest_treeless-island_falklands_pollen-discovered_1s.webp" alt="Selected photomicrographs of fossil pollen produced in an ancient forest by gymnosperm and angiosperm living relatives in the rainforest of southern South America.

Seeds and spores ride wind, float on ocean debris, and travel with birds. During milder, wetter stretches, the odds of survival jump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once early trees took root in a sheltered, waterlogged basin, they could trap moisture, calm ground-level winds, and gradually build a stable community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a familiar pattern in island biology. Given time and the right conditions, a few arrivals can turn into a functioning forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate shifted. Cooling trends and glacial cycles brought colder, windier conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falklands lack high mountains to block strong westerlies or snag extra rainfall, and many soils are thin and peaty. Those factors make it hard for trees to outcompete grasses today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystems do not just follow latitude. Local wind, rainfall, and topography set the rules. Under the current rules, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mountain-greening-threatens-genetic-diversity-of-iconic-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;open grassland&lt;/a&gt; wins across most of the islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fossil evidence gives climate scientists real targets for testing models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a model run with mid-to-late &lt;a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/cenozoic/cenozoic.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cenozoic&lt;/a&gt; conditions places a cool-temperate rainforest on the Falklands, that is a sign it is on track. If it does not, something is missing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These checks turn evidence from a single site into valuable test data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a wider lesson. Ecosystems can move, shrink, expand, or appear in places that seem unusual by today’s standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falklands’ buried forest shows how temperature, rainfall, and wind can reshuffle living communities over long spans of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-case"&gt;Building the case&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork documented and sampled the lignitic layer in place. Lab work isolated pollen and spores, then identified them under microscopes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood pieces were sectioned to reveal diagnostic features. Together, those signals established both habitat and local origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For age, researchers matched the Falklands’ pollen sequence to dated South American profiles, tracking the same marker taxa as they rose and fell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach pinned the layer to a deep time window without relying on radiocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-have-we-learned"&gt;What have we learned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, hidden beneath Stanley on the Falkland Islands lies a pollen record of a cool, wet forest dominated by southern beech and podocarp relatives, growing in a sheltered, waterlogged basin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age falls in the mid-to-late Cenozoic, when warmer intervals allowed trees to push farther poleward and onto islands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This clear snapshot – written in pollen, spores, and wood – adds a useful data point to Earth’s climate history and helps scientists check the tools we use to understand past, present, and future change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/evidence-for-a-floristically-diverse-rainforest-on-the-falkland-archipelago-in-the-remote-south-atlantic-during-the-mid-to-late-cenozoic/B4CFF913DD8F1BB43B570E4086C7CF7B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Antarctic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Francesco Bettariga, lead study researcher and PhD student at Edith Cowan University in Australia, told the Daily Mail: 'By demonstrating anti-cancer effects at the cellular level, our results provide a potential explanation for why exercise reduces the risk of cancer progression, recurrence, and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While our study has limitations and further in vivo work is needed, these findings highlight how exercise could contribute to improved survival outcomes in people with cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this summer in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-025-07772-w"&gt;Breast Cancer Research and Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 32 patients who had been treated for breast cancer, ranging from stage one to stage three, at least four months beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest cancer stage group was stage two (41 percent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 59 with a body mass index (BMI) of 28, which is considered overweight but not obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the resistance training group completed eight repetitions of five sets of exercises for major muscle groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included chest press, seated row, shoulder press, lateral pulldown, leg press, leg extension, leg curl and lunges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group got one to two minutes between sets to rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the HIIT group, participants performed seven 30-second bouts of high-intensity exercise on at least three of the following exercise machines: stationary bike, treadmill, rower and cross-trainer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had three-minute rest periods between sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website: 'We selected two distinct exercise modalities—resistance and aerobic training—because they provide different physiological benefits: resistance training improves muscle strength, while aerobic training enhances cardiorespiratory fitness in order to determine which exercise could drive greater cancer-suppressive effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Specifically, we used a high-intensity exercise to determine whether greater intensity could amplify these anti-cancer effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both groups completed about 45 minutes of exercise in total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also performed blood tests on participants at three separate times: before working out, immediately following the sessions and 30 minutes after working out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that completing either the resistance or HIIT regimen just one time increased levels of myokines in participants' blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest jump was in the myokine IL-6, which increased 47 percent in the HIIT group immediately after exercise. Myokine IL-6 is a protein released from muscles during exercise that plays a crucial role in immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the resistance group showed a 23 percent increase in decorin, a myokin that regulates tissue growth, and a nine percent increase in IL-6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found myokine levels gradually decreased over time after participants finished working out, though they remained elevated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on results, researchers estimated the myokine levels produced from exercising could reduce the growth of cancer cells by 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myokines have been shown to suppress inflammatory proteins called cytokines. Cytokines are secreted by immune cells to control inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, high cytokine levels can trigger excess inflammation, which damages cell DNA and increases the risk of cancer cells forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of the disease, striking 311,000 US women every year and killing 42,000 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A recent study in JAMA found that breast cancer rates went up by about 0.79 percent each year during the study from from 2000 to 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga said: 'We found that both resistance training and HIIT increased the release of myokines with anti-cancer properties after just a single exercise session. We then observed a reduction of up to 30 percent in cancer cell growth in [lab testing]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What stood out was that both modalities had comparable effects, suggesting that exercise intensity is the main driver of these anti-cancer changes, rather than the specific type of exercise performed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer strikes 311,000 American women every year and kills 42,000, according to the American cancer society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the disease generally has a high survival rate of 92 percent, that rate can drop as low as 33 percent if cancer cells spread to other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also on the rise among young women, with rates increasing by 0.8 percent every year from 2000 to 2019, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14177967/breast-cancer-rising-doctors-warn-american-women-report.html"&gt;one study suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Experts have tied this rise to hormone-disrupting chemicals and early menstruation, which can increase exposure to hormones like estrogen that can fuel breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the new study results are promising for breast cancer, it's unclear if they would translate to other forms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettargia said: 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Surprisingly, no studies with this specific design had been conducted in this population, making our findings highly relevant to millions of women living with breast cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including the small sample size and focusing on only one form of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website that the team next plans to investigate these effects in other types of cancer and groups of people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Furthermore, it is now time to examine the effects of regular, long-term exercise programs on these anti-cancer responses. We also aim to explore additional mechanisms particularly the role of the immune system, which plays a crucial part in controlling cancer cell growth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And with the accessibility of ingredients and products easier than ever, the variety of diets is vast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here DailyMail.com speaks to a number of health experts to get their verdicts on the best and worst diets launched over the past century and the old reliable that has stood the test of time.

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE WORST &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;JUICE CLEANSES: 1/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While juice cleanses have become all the rage over the past decade or so after gaining mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s, many health experts are less excited about the concept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other diets, a juice cleanse is a temporary dietary regimen that involves consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a predetermined period, typically ranging from a few days to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often promoted as a way to detoxify the body, lose weight, and improve overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based personal trainer Natalie Alex told this website: 'More recently overly restrictive "detoxes" or juice cleanses often promise quick fixes but leave people depleted, with results that rarely last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These fads tend to ignore balance and sustainability, which is why people so often rebound after them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, New York dermatologist Dr Michele Green isn't a fan of juice cleanses and she gives them just a one out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unlike other diets, a juice cleanse is a temporary dietary regimen that involves consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a predetermined period, typically ranging from a few days to a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Detox diets, including juice cleanses and liquid cleanses, are also not sustainable and often do not provide enough daily nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These extreme diets lack scientific support. Additionally, the body is equipped with mechanisms and organs that effectively flush out potential toxins without the need for detox diets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health also warns of the dangers of juice cleanses, with some of the side effects including 'dangerous electrolyte imbalances', headaches, fainting, weakness, and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;THE KETO DIET: 2/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many health experts Daily Mail spoke to rated the keto diet as one of the worst eating regimens from the past century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy by Dr Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was designed to mimic the effects of fasting by drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption. This helps to manage epilepsy by inducing a metabolic state called ketosis, when the body burns fat energy instead of glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ketosis has been shown to have an anti-seizure effect in people with epilepsy, though the mechanism behind the connection is not fully understood. It could be a change in brain chemistry, change in neuronal activity or improvement in cell function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet encourages followers to eat butter, avocado, coconut, bacon, cream, cheese and some nuts but avoid grains, milk, yogurt, most fruits, legumes, potatoes and many vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Keto diet encourages the consumption of meats, butter and cheese&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Dietitian's Association of Australia, keto diet isn't recommended for the general population as the long-term efficacy and safety of the diet are unknown, having only been studied in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sophie Scott, who is a nutritionist based out of Australia, gave the keto diet a two out of 10 in terms of its effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Keto forces the body to use fat (or more specifically, ketones) as the main fuel source instead of glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Carbohydrates are severely restricted to around 50g per day (equivalent to two slices of bread and a banana) and fat constitutes 70 percent of this diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association also does not recommend the diet for long-term success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from the organization explain: 'In studies up to six months long, improvements in body weight and blood sugar have been shown with these diets. However, after a year, most improvements were no different from the results of a less restrictive diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Restrictions on fruits, whole grains and legumes may result in reduced fiber intake. Additionally, these diets are high in fat without limiting saturated fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consuming high levels of saturated fat and low levels of fiber are both linked to the development of cardiovascular disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;SOUTH  BEACH DIET: 3/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The South Beach Diet focuses on eliminating refined carbs and prioritizing healthy fats like olive oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The South Beach Diet was developed in the mid-1990s by Dr Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist, to help his patients with heart disease and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It gained widespread popularity in 2003 with the release of his best-selling book, The South Beach Diet, which explained the diet's principles for weight loss and improved health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet focuses on eliminating refined carbs and prioritizing healthy fats like olive oil. However, the experts warn that like keto, it can be restrictive and for this reason, they give it a three out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first phase, which lasts for 14 days, involves eating three meals and two snacks daily, mainly protein and non-starchy vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, participants add small amounts of whole grains and fruits, as well as small amounts of alcohol. This phase lasts as long as it takes you to reach your goal weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the final phase, no food is off limits, but participants pay strict attention to serving sizes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The South Beach Diet says that you'll lose 8lbs to 13lbs during phase one, with most of the weight coming from your midsection. In phase two, it says that you'll likely lose 1lb to 2lbs per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no research suggesting that the South Beach diet leads to long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon Palmer, a dietitian at the Plant-Powered Dietitian, said: 'This diet would be hard to follow in the context of cultural diets, and it reinforces diet culture. I would not recommend this diet overall for weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE BEST &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET: 9/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes and olive oil, and features moderate amounts of fish and poultry - and the occasional glass of red wine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long touted by health experts as the secret to a lengthy, healthy life, the Mediterranean diet has been crowned one of the healthiest nutritional plans for promoting an approach to healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concept of the Mediterranean diet was first coined in the 1960s by American biologist Ancel Keys, but its origins trace back to ancient times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's rich in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes and olive oil, and features moderate amounts of fish and poultry - and the occasional glass of red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet eliminates added sugars, refined grains like white breads and pasta, trans fats like in margarine, canola oil and processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionist Sophie Scott told Daily Mail: 'The diet is a 10 out of 10 because it is more of an eating pattern, rather than a prescriptive diet, which makes it easier to follow consistently than other more restrictive diets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She referenced a research paper that found the diet consistently performs well in relation to weight loss, reduction in cardiovascular disease and reduction of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The PREDIMED study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013, showed the Mediterranean diet group had a third less heart disease, diabetes and stroke than the low-fat group. They also lost a little weight and had less memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The benefits can't be narrowed down to one single food or factor but to some general themes,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Extra fiber, a diverse range of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and legumes, yoghurts and cheese, small amounts of fish and meat, red wine, nuts and seeds and good quality olive oil all played their part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the authors believe that the olive oil itself was the most powerful single factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fitness expert Natalie Alex is also a fan of the Mediterranean diet, as she says it is less of a fad and more of a lifestyle. She gives it a nine out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'It supports both long-term health and enjoyment of food, which is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And on the fitness front, the shift toward higher-protein, strength-supporting nutrition in recent years has been beneficial for people looking to maintain lean mass and metabolic health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harvard researchers found that people who followed the DASH diet for 30 years had a 14 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and strokes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;THE DASH DIET: 8.5/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beloved by many health experts, the DASH diet was introduced in 1997 by NIH-supported research teams and it was designed to reduce high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have since shown that the DASH diet can have positive effects on cardiovascular health and may have other health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eating plan encourages eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It favors lean sources of protein, like beans and lean meats, and suggests limiting saturated fats and sugar-sweetened food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the American Heart Association rate this diet at 8.5 out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They explain: 'The DASH-style eating pattern received a perfect score by meeting all of the Association's guidance. These eating patterns are low in salt, added sugar, alcohol, tropical oils and processed foods, and rich in non-starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Protein tends to be mostly from plant sources (such as legumes, beans or nuts), along with fish or seafood, lean poultry and meats, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harvard researchers found that people who followed the diet for 30 years had a 14 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and strokes compared to people on a standard diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York cosmetic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.michelegreenmd.com/botox-nyc"&gt;dermatologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr Michele Green says the DASH diet is also 'excellent' for the skin, as it limits processed sugar and unhealthy fats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'You really notice a glow on this plan,' she adds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;WEIGHT WATCHERS: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Popularized by dozens of celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Kate Hudson, Weight Watchers doesn't involve counting calories. Instead, foods are assigned a certain amount of points based on their nutrients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the top of the diet list with many health experts is the old American favorite diet, Weight Watchers. It got a seven out of 10 overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Introduced in 1963 by Jean Nidetch in New York, it started as a small social support group for friends to lose weight together and today it has more than 3.4 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popularized by dozens of celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Kate Hudson, Weight Watchers doesn't involve counting calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, foods are assigned a certain amount of points based on their nutrients, such as fiber, added sugars, protein, and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods with more unhealthy nutrients like added sugars and fat, and too little of vital compounds like fiber, are assigned more points. Dieters are allotted a specific amount of points to use daily and weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doug Cook, a registered dietitian in Toronto, told US News and World Report: 'Weight Watchers helps people to understand balance in so far that no food is off limits, helping it to be sustainable in the long run. It focuses on wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, etc.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in the BMJ involving 740 overweight or obese participants found that those who used Weight Watchers lost the most weight compared to those on other diets, dropping an average of 9.8lbs after 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, in a review of 45 studies, researchers found that after 12 months of Weight Watchers, members lost 2.6 percent more weight than those who received no weight loss guidance or education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE OLD RELIABLE - 10/10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Instead of a fad diet or brand, the experts say having a grasp of what eating well looks like is of utmost importance and maintaining a healthy balance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When quizzed about which diet has stood the test of time as the 'old reliable,' the health experts revealed a surprising answer: 'just a balanced diet.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of a fad diet or costly branded products, they say having a grasp of what eating well looks like is of utmost importance when it comes to keeping in shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Los Angeles-based Dr Raj Dasgupta told this website: 'The one approach that never goes out of style is eating a variety of real, unprocessed foods, watching portions, and moving your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not flashy, but it's reliable and backed by decades of solid research.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends stocking up on plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats while limiting ultra-processed foods and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michele Green says from her own experience too, a diet in moderation is the one that has always worked best for her. She says eliminating certain food groups can often lead to people giving up and creating an unhealthy relationship with food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'While I think it is important to reduce the consumption of sugary foods, sweets do not need to be cut out completely and can be consumed in moderation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, fitness trainer Natalie Alex concludes: 'Looking ahead, I think we'll see less focus on rigid diets and more emphasis on personalized nutrition plans built around someone's lifestyle, preferences, and health needs, instead of strict rules that are hard to follow long-term.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

According to the CDC, in 2023, high blood pressure was a primary or contributing cause of 664,470 deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sudhanshu Rai recently posted on Instagram that you don’t always need elaborate fixes—"it needs consistency."

Its active compound allicin seems to help dilate blood vessels, reduce arterial stiffness, and lower blood pressure modestly in hypertensive people.

Relaxation and meditation reduce stress hormones like cortisol, improve autonomic balance (more parasympathetic activity), help lower BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut processed foods completely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed foods often contain high sodium, hidden salts, unhealthy fats, added sugars, preservatives. These contribute to hypertension, dyslipidemia, weight gain, inflammation.

			&lt;p&gt;If the sound of a baby crying gets you red in the face, you're not just imagining things. A new study has found that an infant's cries – particularly those that signal pain – really do trigger a hot flush in adults' faces, perhaps as a way of launching us into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies' wailing is, in a sense, unbearable on purpose. Without language, it's an infant's best shot at getting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cuddling-babies-alters-genetics-dna-for-years"&gt;the help they need&lt;/a&gt; from their caregivers. &lt;span&gt;The vibrations that erupt from a baby in serious distress are quite literally more chaotic than the cries of low-level discomfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cries of pain are formed differently than other sounds a baby makes: they forcefully contract their ribcage, pushing high-pressure bursts of air through their vocal cords to produce variable pitches and disharmonious sounds known to acousticians as '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_acoustics"&gt;nonlinear phenomena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;', or NLPs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-could-help-to-redraw-the-infant-cry-curve"&gt;Sorry, Parents: New Research Shows That Infant Crying Doesn't Peak After 6 Weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has been established that NLP are reliable markers of the level of distress and/or pain expressed by the baby," Jean Monnet University bioacoustician Lény Lego and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results demonstrate that the level of NLP in a cry modulates the temporal dynamics of the facial thermal response in listeners, independent of their sex."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caregivers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-tell-if-an-infant-is-crying-in-pain-or-just-a-cry-baby"&gt;can usually differentiate&lt;/a&gt; between cries of ordinary discomfort and those blood-curdling NLPs that signal serious pain, but it's unclear exactly how our bodies arrive at this higher-order cognitive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from Jean Monnet University and the University of Saint-Etienne, both in France, wanted to know how these sounds affect adults' nervous systems on a subconscious level and the physiological effects they elicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tested the reactions of 41 participants (21 men, 20 women, aged 35 years old on average) to the sounds of babies crying. These adults listened to a selection of 23 audio tracks, recorded from 16 different infants while they were either experiencing the benign discomfort of a bath, or the pain of a vaccine jab at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the participants listened, a thermal camera tracked changes to their face temperature. An increase in heat from this part of the body is a response from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"&gt;autonomic nervous system,&lt;/a&gt; the largely unconscious part of our nervous system that controls internal body functions like heart rate, breathing, and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After listening, the participants also reported whether they thought they had heard sounds of either discomfort or pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Variations in a listener's facial temperature, a marker of the autonomic emotional response, reflect the pain expressed by a baby's cry," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cry with a higher level of NLP elicited a stronger flush response from listeners' faces, suggesting that these chaotic sounds are much more effective at getting the attention of adults, on a physiological level, than cries with little or no NLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response to high-NLP cries was seen equally in male and female participants, adding to the researcher's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.06.076"&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that both sexes can reliably identify pain in a baby's cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173504" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173504" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-173504" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675.jpg 1000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173504" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Peter Cade/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While our results sound interesting and new, this study remains rather preliminary and raises a number of questions, both in terms of interpreting the results and from a methodological point of view," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, the participants had little or no experience with babies, so these results don't necessarily reflect the physiological response of seasoned parents. Future studies could reveal how physiological responses to NLP differ based on experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also note the cries played in this study are natural sounds, a messy smorgasbord of acoustic phenomena. They're yet to unpack exactly which NLP elicit a thermal response, or if, perhaps, it's their unsettling combination that sends such a powerful SOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;Journal of the Royal Society Interface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At 28, she had taken on a unit in Chester to convert into a yoga studio, poured in all her savings and hired teachers, while at the same time working as a personal trainer. Her days started at 5am; she was driven, stressed, excited, and had no time for the back pain that just would not subside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It kept moving around,” she says. “Every day it would be in a different part of my back. I was strapping on heat packs and ice packs just to get to work.” Smith saw her GP, her physiotherapist and a chiropractor, all of whom suspected a torn muscle. “What really worried me,” she says, “the worst-case scenario, was a slipped disc.” One day in March 2020, the pain was so intense that Smith took to her bed, fell asleep and woke with a crashing migraine and blurred vision. Her mum took her to the optician who shone a light behind Smith’s eyes, saw haemorrhaging and sent her straight to the hospital. Once there, Smith was admitted, and over the course of a week, had an MRI, a CT scan, and a biopsy taken from the cells in her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/lung-cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Lung cancer"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/youngpeople","type":"Keyword","title":"Young people"},{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/anna-moore","type":"Contributor","title":"Anna Moore"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/sep/14/lung-cancer-young-fit-non-smoking-women","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith was alone in her bed when two doctors appeared, closed the curtains, and told her that she had cancer in her lungs that had spread down her spine and up into her brain. It was stage four. “They said there was nothing they could do for me,” says Smith. “All I remember is ringing my mum and screaming down the phone. The doctors told my parents that I probably had about two weeks to live.” This was the early days of Covid, and Smith chose to go home for palliative care. “I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out, as you do when you go through trauma,” says Smith. “My friends all came to say goodbye. They were sitting at the end of my bed crying their eyes out. I’ve still got a whole book of the letters they wrote me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="72976a7b-8a38-4cc5-8926-df6ead2255a9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Becca Smith had planned to open a yoga studio before she became ill. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, lung cancer has been viewed as a disease of older men, a “smokers’ disease”, heavily stigmatised and until very recently, grossly underfunded. &lt;a href="https://www.icr.ac.uk/research-and-discoveries/cancer-blogs/detail/science-talk/let-s-work-together-to-end-the-stigma-around-lung-cancer#:~:text=The%20stigma%20around%20the%20disease,account%20the%20burden%20of%20disease." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One analysis from 2010&lt;/a&gt; found it received only 6% of cancer research funding, despite being the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/lung-cancer#lung_stats0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;third most common cancer in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent years though, the patient profile has shifted. Smoking remains the main risk factor, but cases among fit, young, non-smoking women have risen, both as a proportion and in absolute numbers. And while screening is now available in England for those over 55 with a history of smoking – &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/the-devil-is-in-the-detail-our-response-to-the-10-year-health-plan/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;76% of the lung cancer cases identified by screening are at stage one or two and &lt;/a&gt;potentially curable – young, non-smoking women like Smith tend to be diagnosed only after the cancer has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Alex Georgiou, a consultant medical oncologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital, has analysed the data of his lung cancer patients to understand these changes. “Between 2010 and 2021, the number of patients at our clinic who haven’t smoked has increased every year,” he says. “In 2010, it was 5% of cases. By 2021, it was 14%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of these non-smoking lung cancer cases, 68% were women, compared with 43% of those with a history of smoking. There was also a higher proportion of younger patients: 16% of the non-smoking patients were aged below 50 compared with 5% from the smoking group – and more Black and Asian patients too. White people made up 72% of the smoking cases, compared with just 44% of the non-smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We might expect a high proportion of Asian patients, as non-smoking lung cancer is very prevalent in south-east Asia,” says Georgiou. “But the higher number of black patients is less recognised. They made up 17% of the non-smoking cases versus 5% from the group with a smoking history.” There were also clear differences in stage of presentation and disease progression. Two-thirds of the non-smoking patients presented at stage four, the most advanced stage, and 38% had cancer that had spread to the brain. “It’s not only that the demographics are different,” says Georgiou. “The biology of the cancer is different too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These findings reflect worldwide trends but, as yet, none of it is fully understood. According to Cecilia Pompili, a thoracic surgeon and clinical senior lecturer at Hull York Medical School, we are just beginning to ask the questions. “For so long, we didn’t think of lung cancer as a disease of young women and often haven’t even included them in clinical research trials,” she says. (For example, &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerstoday.com/post/dr-narjust-florez-on-the-reality-of-lung-cancer-in-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;men have made up 65% of participants&lt;/a&gt; in groundbreaking immunotherapy trials for lung cancer.) Pompili is interviewing women with lung cancer about their early symptoms and diagnosis pathway, for a study funded by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer diagnosed in non-smokers, and while some women experience the “classic” persistent cough, and also coughing up blood, for others, symptoms are more vague and non-specific, such as weight loss, or back pain. “We want to understand the symptom trajectory and also whether women are treated differently by their health provider,” says Pompili. “We know from some patients that a 40-year-old, fit woman with a persistent cough is more likely to be diagnosed with an allergy, asthma or an infection than an older male smoker who will be sent for a chest X-ray.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Identifying why lung cancer is rising in women requires much more research, says Pompili. Hormones could play a part. Worldwide, indoor air pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and biomass fuels used for cooking and heating has been identified as a significant risk factor. In the UK, &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/learn-about-lung-cancer/lung-cancer-risk-factors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;outdoor air pollution is believed to cause around one in 10 lung cancers&lt;/a&gt;. “Air pollution has been demonstrated to be significant for both genders, especially in younger patients,” says Pompili. It’s possible that women’s smaller lungs and narrower airways lead to a higher concentration of pollutants and a greater likelihood of fine particulate matter – 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter – becoming trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella was the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate, is not surprised. “Ella had asthma but there are 700 diseases impacted by air pollution,” she says. “When I think of younger women with lung cancer, I wonder about the school run, the time sitting in cars or buses in heavy traffic. When I think about the higher number of black and brown people, I think of economics. Who takes buses, and waits at bus stops, and lives in social housing and cheaper housing close to main roads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“London is the most congested city in Europe. Worldwide, we are number five,” continues Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who campaigns for cleaner air through the &lt;a href="https://www.ellaroberta.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ella Roberta Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “Yet somehow, officially, Ella is still the only person who has died because of air pollution. We’ve got to the point where the burden of ill health caused by air pollution is so huge, I’m asking myself: ‘What will it take to make the public demand more action?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also key here – but again, not fully understood – is the role of genetic mutations, especially in younger non-smoking women. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common, &lt;a href="https://www.egfrpositive.org.uk/what-is-egfr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;believed to cause 10-15% of lung cancers in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2022-09-10_scientists-reveal-how-air-pollution-can-cause-lung-cancer-in-people-who-have-never-smoked" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has identified how air pollution might “wake up” dormant cells in the lungs that carry these cancer-causing mutations, promoting their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah Li, a 42-year-old freelance film-maker, was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer last year. A non-smoker and a vegan, Li lives in London and was signed up for her seventh marathon at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’d had a persistent cough but I wasn’t worried,” she says. “I’d had a cold first and the cough just seemed to come off the back of it.” Li was also experiencing pain in her right shoulder. “Looking back, that was another symptom but I didn’t know enough to join the dots.” A physio suggested shoulder exercises and a pharmacist sold Li syrup for her cough. After four months though, as the cough worsened, Li saw her GP, expecting antibiotics for a chest infection. Instead, she was referred for a chest X-ray, then fast-tracked for a CT scan. In April 2024, Li learned she had inoperable lung cancer, with a tumour on her left lung, and cancer also present in nodules in her right lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even now, I find it strange when I say I have lung cancer,” says Li. “I can say I have cancer – so many people get cancer – but the idea of lung cancer still feels quite foreign. How am I the face of lung cancer? When I was first diagnosed, I went through everything, asking: ‘Why? What did I do?’ I think I led a healthy lifestyle, but I lived in India for four years, in Hyderabad, a busy city. I feel strange blaming any one thing or focusing on what I might have done wrong. Nobody wants this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8bb545b7-c72b-42d1-bad6-a93d4588e814" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sarah Li was diagnosed with lung cancer last year.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although Li had only been with her partner Robin for 18 months, they had to have difficult conversations about fertility and future children. “Did I want to freeze my eggs before treatment? We decided it was better to keep me alive and start treatment as soon as possible.” In fact, the impact of lung cancer on fertility has only just become an area of research. The International Pregnancy and Lung &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Registry was launched in December 2023. “Understanding how lung cancer and its treatment impacts young women in all ways – their whole lives, their fertility, their young family and caring responsibilities, their career, is only just beginning,” says Pompili. “It’s something we have done for breast cancer – but not lung cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After years of underfunding (widely attributed to lung cancer’s link with smoking), pioneering treatments are developing fast – especially for cancers like Li’s, driven by genetic mutations. In the last decade, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has &lt;a href="https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/nices-increasing-cancer-treatment-recommendations#:~:text=Since%202015%2C%20NICE%20has%20made,immune%20system%20to%20combat%20cancer." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended 48 new treatments&lt;/a&gt; for lung cancer – six times more than in the previous decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Li’s first round of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy led to massive reductions in her tumours. However, in January, a small lesion was found on her brain. She is now having a targeted therapy – a daily pill – and more chemo. “Life is more intense now,” she says. “There’s more vividness to everything. Like today, I’m just so happy that I’m feeling well enough to be outside, to have a nice lunch. Those little things you take for granted … you’re just way more appreciative of it all. The idea of talking about ‘two years’ time’ or ‘five years’ time’ like my friends do? I can’t. I know that eventually the cancer will outsmart the treatment I’m on. Hopefully, by then, there’ll be another treatment pathway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is in the same position. A few weeks into her palliative care, the family were informed by phone that the biopsy taken from Smith’s back showed a genetic mutation, ALK-positive lung cancer, and a treatment was available. She began taking eight tablets a day – targeted cancer drugs, ALK inhibitors – with monthly blood tests and scans every three months. “It went well, there was a big reduction in cancer,” she says. “After two years, I got some progression in my brain, so I’m on the second line of treatment now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Explaining her disease to others is exhausting. “You always get the same reaction,” she says. “‘But you don’t smoke?’ ‘You’re so young?’ There’s such a community around breast cancer – more power to it – but with lung cancer, there really isn’t. It feels like it’s just you.” This is despite the fact that the disease &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-Fact-Sheet-2024.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;kills as many women&lt;/a&gt; as breast, ovarian and cervical cancers combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is a pilates teacher now – this summer, she went on a yoga retreat in Bali. Her partner, Sammy, flew out to join her in July and, during a walk on the beach, he proposed. “This is my dream. I’m enjoying my life,” she says. “I’ve gone through so much. I lost the yoga studio, I lost a lot of money, but the things you think matter? They really don’t. All I care about is my family and friends, and being happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I still feel sadness and I’m scared – I’m terrified because I don’t know what’s to come,” she continues. “Scans never get easier, but you get better at dealing with them. It’s a cliche but I genuinely live for today now – and five years on, I’ve finally reached a stage where I can be grateful for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2dBWngtTDM2Q2hnc0kzNXI4UE9OVzcwS1ZGQmpFQjNYenI0X0xVZkp6bnp4QVYzWHdJVkJEOFU4c3otVWw5WHBMNzF6MHB3SEcxSWFHN1FGYnA5Yk9WNTBYdGc2amdIN0sxSnVoUU9lYWlaUlNDeXBfd0VMY0xvTEN0M1FtLWJUSmdLNWdSczY</guid></item><item><title>现在每个人都有一个中国肽经销商-旧金山标准</title><link>https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/14/everyone-has-chinese-peptide-dealer-now/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-grid article-content"&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;On an August morning, among the marble columns and Tuscan frescoes in the Fairmont Hotel’s Laurel Court restaurant, a back table became an impromptu chemistry class. Lynne Ji, a slim 27-year-old dressed in black athleisure, moved aside a china teapot, unzipped a black business-class airline pouch, and tipped an array of glass vials onto the table. They contained powdered and liquid versions of the peptide retatrutide, a next-generation GLP-1 compound made by pharma giant Eli Lilly, currently in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05931367"&gt;Phase 3 clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. It was getting a lot of buzz in her group chats, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji, a retired poker pro who dabbles in crypto, began microdosing retatrutide in February. Within days, she said, her “food noise” faded, her portions shrank, and her weight dropped from 135 to 115 pounds. “I am exactly vain enough to inject myself to look thinner,” she said. “I played poker for a career, so taking risks doesn’t bother me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji’s stash didn’t come from a pharmacy but from a Chinese peptide dealer she’d been connected to on WhatsApp by tech friends. She paid the guy $195 for 10 vials. “Three weeks later, it shows up at your door,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-full inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;A growing number of techies are injecting Chinese peptides for their purported health benefits, from improving libido to fat loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji’s approach to DIY dosing is part of a growing Bay Area trend that’s evolving beyond psychedelics and nootropics into needles and peptide stacks. This cohort of mostly tech industry people are injecting research-grade peptides in hopes of a health or performance boost to address everything from fat loss and recovery to focus and libido. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;A few years ago, most people didn’t know a peptide from a protein shake. Then came &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/prevention-wellness/spending-glp-1s-has-grown-dramatically-here-are-details"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which turned GLP-1s (glucagon-like peptides, originally designed to treat diabetes but repurposed for weight loss) into a household name. Serena Williams shills GLP-1s for the telehealth brand &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://ro.co/lp/weight-loss/quiz/serena/"&gt;Ro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;SF-based telehealth company Hims &amp;amp; Hers advertises microdosing GLP-1s on Muni buses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But GLP-1s, which mimic gut hormones to help regulate blood sugar, are only one branch of peptides, which are strings of amino acids that build proteins and act on certain cell types to change functions in the body. You’ll find peptides in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11762834/"&gt;luxury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; skincare serums and oral supplements, but doctors consider injection the gold standard for efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Enthusiasts stock up on peptides like BPC-157 (“body protection compound”) for &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6271067/"&gt;tendon and ligament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; healing; GHK-Cu, a copper peptide believed to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6073405/"&gt;increase collagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and hair growth; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7747025/"&gt;Thymosin alpha-1 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;(TA-1) for immune support; Selank to reduce &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/p1114-rapid-and-slow-response-during-treatment-of-generalized-anxiety-disorder-with-peptide-anxiolytic-selank/7A497218D37084BD079EFE143126F56E"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;; and Semax, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10218113/"&gt;developed for stroke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; recovery, for a brain boost. Some of these health claims are supported by small studies; others by little more than message-board testimonials. Regardless, for some DIY health experimenters, the term “peptide” has become synonymous with quick fixes and radical life upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="!p-0 !m-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;That DIY culture is colliding with a regulatory crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-full inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Superpower co-founder Max Marchione prepares a copper peptide injection from China at the company office in San Francisco. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Starting in 2023, the Food and Drug Administration began steadily restricting access to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://a4pc.org/news/2023-10/fda-puts-some-peptides-off-limits"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; peptides, moving several — including BPC-157, CJC-1295, and ipamorelin, which were formerly available from U.S. compounding pharmacies — into its &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/certain-bulk-drug-substances-use-compounding-may-present-significant-safety-risks"&gt;“Category 2 bucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” shorthand for bulk substances that “may present significant safety risks” like poor immune responses, and shouldn’t be compounded. (Some were removed from that list in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/october-29-2024-meeting-pharmacy-compounding-advisory-committee-10292024"&gt;2024.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services secretary, has tweeted complaints about the FDA’s &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737"&gt;war on peptides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. But that has not led to any change to regulations or availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Health hackers have turned to the gray market to source their  vials from dealers in China, where most peptides are manufactured. These dealers sell vials labeled “not for human use.” Purchasing this way amounts to a regulatory hack that opens the Chinese supply chain to anyone with a credit card, under the fiction that the drugs are for laboratory use only. Chinese peptide imports from non-FDA registered companies rose 44% from December to January, according to the Partnership for Safe Medicines, a nonprofit &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.safemedicines.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PSM-White-Paper-v1-PUBLIC-VERSION.pdf"&gt;watchdog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Representatives for the FDA declined to comment but directed The Standard to the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/fdas-concerns-unapproved-glp-1-drugs-used-weight-loss"&gt;agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Concerns with Unapproved GLP-1 Drugs Used for Weight Loss, which warns against purchasing peptides labeled “for research purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR  inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="none"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Are peptides in the startup fridge the new company perk?&lt;span class="image-caption-divider"&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;Jason Henry for The Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Despite peptides being one of pop culture’s buzziest words right now – alongside Labubu and matcha —  they’re not a new phenomena. Peptides were discovered in humans in the 1920s, but it wasn’t until breakthrough synthesizing techniques were developed in the 1950s that scientists began studying their use in treating disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Thousands have been cataloged, and around 100 peptide-based drugs have made it to market, with 150 in active clinical trials. “Peptides are super important,” said pathology professor Katrin J. Svensson, who runs a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://svenssonlabstanford.org"&gt;metabolic regulation lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; at Stanford University.  “They often have fewer side effects than other types of drugs.” Since peptides are already present in the body, adding more is considered low risk, she added..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Research-grade peptides usually arrive as powders that require dilution with bacteriostatic water. But what shows up in the mail is anyone’s guess. “There is no regulation on the purity,” said Svensson. “It’s pretty dangerous.” Risks range from accidental overdose due to inconsistent labelling to vomiting and severe dehydration, or even sepsis, “if mixed in unsterile conditions,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Even the first step, mixing, can be dicey, Svennsson warned; the math behind the dilution process, referred to as reconstitution, is complex enough to spawn countless online “peptide calculators.” Eyeballing a vial isn’t enough. “Holding the bottle up to the light doesn’t mean it’s actually dissolved,” she said. “You need an instrument to determine this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Tim Fitzgerald, who runs the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hocwc.com"&gt;Human Optimization Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a wellness spa in Walnut Creek offering cryotherapy, red-light therapy, and other treatments, began using peptides in 2016 after suffering a herniated disc and autoimmune issues he attributed to “vaccine injuries.” Within weeks, his pain was gone, he claims. He emphasizes lifestyle changes — “protein, training, sleep, light — all of it matters” — alongside “use as needed” peptide injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“It’s not a magic bullet,” he said. “Someone who’s a metabolic dumpster fire isn’t going to get the result just by hopping on a shot.” He has cycled through a few types of peptides; treating a condition called “small intestine bacterial overgrowth,” (SIBO), a concussion, and muscle healing. Recently, though, he took a break: “I was starting to feel a bit like a human pin cushion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading-block article-body text-left"&gt;The Peptide bros&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-wide inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="wide"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Marchione holding peptides from China he keeps in a fridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Max Marchione, the baby-faced 25-year-old cofounder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/11/04/new-tech-flex-longevity-concierge/" data-post-id="5fee25af-e32f-4d50-9448-6fcef0b4ab28"&gt;Superpower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a telehealth-for-longevity startup based in SoMa, isn’t fazed by the needles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Before the company moved offices in September, the communal fridge doubled as a pharmacy. Mornings began with a ritual: Marchione lifting his shirt to swab his abs, cofounder Jacob Peters dropping trou to swab his butt, and Shaun Miller, the vice president of medical operations, alternating between hip and backside. (“I didn’t know people injected anywhere else,” said Peters.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Marchione started with peptides a few months ago but is already an evangelist. “All that matters is if I increase performance, even if it introduces a bit of short-term risk,” he reasoned, focusing on improvements in sleep, muscle gain, cognition, and immunity. “If that improves performance, it justifies it long term.” What hooked him was the contrast with supplements, which he could swallow daily and still feel no shift in energy, focus, or recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;As none of his preferred peptides are approved by the FDA, Marchione buys products labeled “for research use only.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“I get them from a Chinese peptide dealer,” he said. He’d prefer to source them domestically. “When you make something that people want hard to get, you create a black market,” said Miller. “The sentiment went from ‘I have my favorite compounding pharmacy’ to ‘I have my Chinese peptide dealer.’ If the supply wasn’t restricted, people would still be going the legitimate path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Miller’s $1,000-a-month peptide stack is small change next to Peters’ $5,000 (“It’s a lot of money, but it’s such a massive ROI,” said Peters.) and Miller’s $2,000. (Biohackers have a nickname for Miller’s four daily injections: the “Wolverine Stack.”) Marchione’s stack includes two shots in the morning and one at night, with others on an ad hoc basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;As the hype over peptide efficacy outruns the data, Marchione has become an unexpected source of info for the community. His phone pings at all hours with sourcing and dosing questions from founders and investors. While The Standard watched, he pulled up a photo of a New York friend’s freezer jammed with tiny, color-capped vials. “That’s probably $100,000 to $250,000 worth of peptides,” he said. “Maybe more, in retail value. You gotta get on the peptide train.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Hence the emergence of Superpower’s Peptide Friday. In June, the company began doling out syringes alongside coffee at its weekly all-hands breakfast for the 20 to 30 employees who work in the office. The lineup has included thymosin alpha-1 (often dubbed by fans as an “immune booster”) and NAD, a coenzyme known for supporting cellular repair. “It started as a joke,” said Marchione. But the company’s roughly 150 employees are into the free peptide shots, said VP of operations Adam Small, noting that it’s a good way to get more folks to come into the office to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Many purchasers of gray-market Chinese peptides have complained about the wildly varying quality. This infuriated Michael Carter, the San Francisco-based founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://Play.co"&gt;Play.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a mobile gaming startup. After he re-injured his back in 2024, friends suggested peptides. He felt a lot better but hated buying from a sketchy website. “I don’t want to inject some crazy thing,” he said. “You’re opting out of the FDA, but you don’t want to opt out of supply chain safety.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;In March, he launched &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.finnrick.com/"&gt;Finnrick,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; a peptide-testing platform backed by AngelList founder Naval Ravikant; Cameron Teitelman of StartX, Stanford University’s innovation accelerator; and Walter Kortschak, a venture capitalist and early investor in Lyft, Robinhood, and Palantir. “I made the investment in the belief this is a rapidly growing market,” said Kortschak. “Having more transparency [provides] great benefits to everyone.” Consumers mail in their vials, and the samples get sent to labs for free testing (similar labs &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://janoshik.com/pricing/"&gt;charge fees)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; of purity, quantity, and potency. Finnrick also buys batches itself, taking steps to conceal its identity from the sellers. For each sample, the verdict comes back — a grade of A through E, with A the best — and is published online. Paid subscribers get extra analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Finnrick has tested 2,378 samples (with another 1,500 in the queue) of 15 types of peptides from 122 vendors. The lab found zero semaglutide in five of the six vials tested from one vendor, and the sixth had 5% extra product, which could lead to accidental overdosing (earning that company an E grade).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“We get emails from vendors demanding we take the data down,” said Carter. He doesn’t. The project doesn’t make unapproved drugs safe, but it makes the risk more legible. “Everyone has a peptide guy,” he said. “What people need is transparent information so they can make their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-wide inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="wide"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Not everyone is sourcing their peptides themselves. Some concierge doctors offer non-FDA-approved peptides via overseas channels, domestic “research use only” sellers, or via the small number of compounding pharmacies allowed to serve licensed clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“I’m only as good as my compounder,” said Dr. Bronwyn Holmes, a San Francisco specialist  in anti-aging and pediatrics who sits on the medical advisory board at Eden Health, a telehealth platform. Holmes has prescribed peptides since 2018, often BPC-157 and thymosin for women recovering from cosmetic surgery and GLP-1s for weight loss. Around 20% of her weight-loss patients are on retatrutide, the investigational peptide. “I see an uptick in, ‘Hey, I saw this on a podcast. What do you think?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Dr. &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://drmolly.co/"&gt;Molly Maloof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a Bay Area physician who has lectured at Stanford University and specializes in treating tech executives, is all in on mainstreaming peptides. “I’m bullish, because I believe peptides are medicine for health and not just disease,” she said. “We’re going to see a lot of the gray market become the white market in the next decade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Maloof has a proactive approach to peptides: “I don’t recommend anything to patients I haven’t tested myself,” she said, describing four daily injections. The standout has been Selank, an &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5322660/"&gt;anti-anxiety peptide,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; designed to calm the nervous system without sedation while potentially boosting focus and memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“My god. You definitely notice a major shift — your brain just feels smooth,” she said. “It’s so nice.” To source quality peptides, Maloof visits labs, verifies supply chains, and pushes chemists for proof via batch numbers, test methods, and results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But Maloof and Holmes are concierge doctors with concierge pricing. For people without sufficient money or connections, the fallback is usually a sketchy website they heard about on a podcast. A thirtysomething San Francisco-based engineer told me they flew to Mexico for injections “from a witch.” Another sourced a dealer via Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji, the retired poker player, doesn’t pretend peptides are risk-free. “I’m almost certain this is not a miracle drug that has zero long-term damage,” she said of microdosed retatrutide. She has also tried semaglutide and BPC-157. She worries friends are taking unnecessarily high doses. But for the most part, the curiosity outpaces the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“Under 20% of my friends do it,” she said. A higher number have pulled the trigger on peptide purchases, but not on the syringe. “They mentally put it on hold. They don’t really care, as they’re in pretty good shape. But they’re curious, so…” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;So now they have a peptide guy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

The research, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/fo/d5fo01620g" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that creatine supplementation can reduce the physical symptoms of ulcerative colitis while also preventing mood and motor disturbances. In rats with colitis, creatine appeared to reduce intestinal inflammation, preserve brain function, and prevent the development of anxiety and depression-like behaviors. The protective effects were observed in both male and female rats, though some benefits were more pronounced in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon that often follows a cycle of flares and remission. Along with gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea, many patients experience mental health challenges, including depression and anxiety. Some of these symptoms tend to persist even during periods when intestinal inflammation appears to be under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has suggested that the connection between gut inflammation and mental health may be driven by what scientists call the gut–brain axis. This is a complex communication network that includes neural, hormonal, and immune signals linking the digestive system with the brain. When the colon becomes inflamed, this communication pathway may promote changes in the brain that affect mood and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in both humans and rodents have shown that gut inflammation is associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in the brain, particularly in areas involved in mood and motor control. This neuroinflammatory response is often linked to the activation of microglia, the immune cells of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments for ulcerative colitis mainly target gastrointestinal symptoms. While these treatments can help reduce flare-ups, they often do not address the emotional or cognitive effects of the disease. That gap led &lt;a href="https://departamento.us.es/fisiologia/fisiopatologia-del-intestino-cerebro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;researchers at the University of Seville&lt;/a&gt; to investigate whether creatine might offer a broader range of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a well-known saying from Hippocrates, the father of medicine: ‘All disease begins in the gut.’ While not every illness comes from the gut, today’s science shows a strong link between gut health and the brain,” said study author María Dolores Vázquez-Carretero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202400837R"&gt;our earlier work&lt;/a&gt; in an animal model, we demonstrated that chronic gut inflammation not only damages the intestine but also leads to problems with mood, memory, and locomotion. This fact should be considered in the therapies of inflammatory bowel diseases and made us wonder: could there be a safe and familiar molecule that helps both the gut and the brain at the same time?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine quickly caught our attention. It’s already widely used by athletes to boost performance, and it has a long record of safety, even approved by the FDA. On top of that, creatine has known anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, and some studies had hinted it might ease gut symptoms and even depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also wanted to explore differences between males and females,” Vázquez-Carretero continued. “Both gut disorders and mood problems are known to vary by sex, but very few studies look at both systems together—the gut and the brain—in a way that allows us to compare results between males and females.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a rat model that mimics the relapsing–remitting nature of ulcerative colitis. They induced chronic colitis in male and female Wistar rats using dextran sulfate sodium, a chemical that causes inflammation in the colon. This model produces symptoms that resemble human colitis, including diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some rats were given creatine supplementation in their drinking water starting 10 days before the colitis-inducing treatment and continuing throughout the experiment. The researchers tracked the severity of colitis symptoms using a disease activity index and also assessed behavioral signs of anxiety, depression, and motor function using an open field test. They collected brain and colon tissue at the end of the study to measure creatine concentrations, inflammation markers, and microglial activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included both sexes to explore whether creatine’s effects differed in males and females. This attention to sex differences is notable, as both ulcerative colitis and mood disorders are more common in women, but animal research often underrepresents female subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that creatine supplementation led to widespread improvements in both intestinal and neurological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rats with colitis, creatine reduced the overall disease activity score during flare-up phases. This included less weight loss, improved stool consistency, and reduced bleeding. The intestinal lining also showed less damage, especially in male rats, where creatine appeared to protect the surface epithelium more effectively. Importantly, these benefits were observed throughout the disease progression and did not seem tied to whether the colitis was in an active or remissive state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both sexes, creatine supplementation increased creatine levels in the colon and cerebral cortex. This suggests that the compound was absorbed and distributed effectively, reaching both peripheral and central tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavioral results showed that rats with colitis exhibited reduced locomotion, signs of anxiety, and depression-like symptoms such as increased immobility and decreased grooming. Creatine prevented these changes, keeping behavior in treated rats comparable to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Females tended to benefit more strongly in certain areas. For example, the improvement in traveled distance, a measure of motor activity, was greater in females than males. Similarly, reductions in immobility time and increases in center exploration—measures associated with lower anxiety and depression—were more pronounced in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, creatine worked in both sexes, though in some cases females benefited more,” Vázquez-Carretero told PsyPost. “This highlights how important it is to study treatments in both males and females rather than assuming the results are the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biological mechanisms behind these behavioral improvements appeared to involve reductions in neuroinflammation. In rats with colitis, the researchers observed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor, in both the prefrontal and motor cortices. These increases were prevented by creatine. The pattern of change varied slightly by sex, with creatine appearing to reduce interleukin-6 more strongly in males and interleukin-1 beta more strongly in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microscopic analysis of the brain showed that colitis activated microglia in both sexes, a sign of inflammation in the central nervous system. Creatine supplementation prevented these changes, and again, some effects were stronger in females, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key message is that creatine could be a promising nutritional strategy to help with both gut inflammation and emotional issues that sometimes come with it,” Vázquez-Carretero said. “In our study with rats, creatine reduced the severity of colitis symptoms like diarrhea and weight loss, protected the gut barrier, and prevented anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. It even helped avoid brain inflammation that is linked to these problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer preliminary support for the idea that creatine might be a useful supplement for managing both the intestinal and neurological symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis. The supplement not only improved physical symptoms of colitis but also protected brain function and behavior, possibly by reducing inflammation and preserving tissue function in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important point is this: creatine is not just a sports supplement,” Vázquez-Carretero said. “It may also be a safe, affordable tool to protect both gut health and mental health at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings are promising, they come from a rat model and cannot be directly applied to human treatment without further research. Human trials would be needed to confirm whether creatine supplementation has similar benefits in people with ulcerative colitis, especially in terms of mood and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that creatine is not a replacement for standard medical treatment. Instead, it may offer a complementary approach, possibly helping to improve quality of life and reduce psychiatric symptoms that are not always addressed by conventional therapies. Although creatine is widely considered safe and is already used as a dietary supplement, especially by athletes, its use in clinical populations still requires careful testing..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/fo/d5fo01620g" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Creatine differently prevents chronic colitis-induced motor deficits, anxiety and depressive behaviors, neuroinflammation, and microglial activation in male and female rats&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Gema Sotelo-Parrilla, Alejandro Ruiz-Calero, Pablo García-Miranda, María Luisa Calonge, María Dolores Vázquez-Carretero, and María José Peral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 12:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxObG9WWWJ0WmhKMk9sU21VR3c0cERPdEVJa1E3MUdldTFITVJIUnNqbksyNU1handyeDJMQ1RWZG5aRTNOd1l0NUNWc3lhamk4bXNBcHYydDUwS0hqbWRKSmMxRm4wLTBIYmx1UVVxdXJfTklYOFQ4S0ZaY3lFS0JKeE5sdndOZXNpMFFfMHlXdnFYRGVNelpZUkJYYWxRcnZ1aGdUWFF3</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病可能由烧坏的脑细胞引发- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain responsible for motor movement. Now there's fresh evidence for how these crucial brain cells are being killed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(90)91341-D"&gt;previous studies in animal models&lt;/a&gt; showing that as these neurons die, the remaining ones work harder, researchers from the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease in the US used genetically modified mice to test the theory that intense bursts of overactivity could be causing the initial damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiments showed that when drugs were used to artificially stimulate &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dopamine-doesnt-work-in-our-brains-quite-the-way-we-thought"&gt;dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of the test animals for several days, the cells gradually degenerated and then died – specifically in the region for motor control known as the substantia nigra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-link-to-gut-bacteria-hints-at-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;Parkinson's Link to Gut Bacteria Hints at an Unexpected, Simple Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An overarching question in the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="173785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; research field has been why the cells that are most vulnerable to the disease die," &lt;a href="https://gladstone.org/news/overworked-brain-cells-may-burn-out-parkinsons-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ken Nakamura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Answering that question could help us understand why the disease occurs and point toward new ways to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173788" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173788" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/NeuronScan.jpg" alt="Neuron scan" class="wp-image-173788 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/NeuronScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/NeuronScan-600x208.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173788" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied overactive dopamine neurons in mouse brains, finding changes in calcium production. (Rademacher et al., &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with neuron death in general, it's not clear if the loss of overworked cells could be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/damaged-dna-could-warn-of-parkinsons-long-before-symptoms"&gt;triggering Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, or if the neurons' exhaustion is more of a consequence of the disease. It may be a bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also undetermined why these cells go into overdrive in the first place. Different environmental and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt; could be involved, the researchers suggest, raising questions for further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a close analysis of the mice brains, the team found that the neurons that were running hot showed changes in calcium levels, and in the expression of genes related to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/unexpected-discovery-about-dopamine-may-help-explain-parkinsons"&gt;dopamine metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and calcium regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further examination of brain cells from people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-the-earliest-roots-of-parkinson-s-disease-in-the-brain"&gt;early-stage Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; showed similar patterns related to calcium regulation and dopamine production. It's as if some of the cells' healthy stress responses had been dialed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In response to chronic activation, we think the neurons may try to avoid excessive dopamine – which can be toxic – by decreasing the amount of dopamine they produce," &lt;a href="https://gladstone.org/news/overworked-brain-cells-may-burn-out-parkinsons-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Katerina Rademacher, from the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, the neurons die, eventually leading to insufficient dopamine levels in the brain areas that support movement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest there might be a vicious cycle at work, where overactive neurons die off and then the remaining neurons become more active to compensate. It's a little like lightbulbs becoming too bright and blowing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of reasons have been put forward to explain why dopamine-producing neurons die off in Parkinson's, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-parkinsons-protein-structure-and-malfunction-revealed-for-first-time"&gt;malfunctioning mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; (the energy sources inside cells) to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds"&gt;harmful protein clumps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there's a new option to consider, which the researchers want to test further: and if this does indeed help explain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-brand-new-parkinsons-trigger-has-been-found-and-it-begins-far-earlier-than-thought"&gt;why the disease gets started&lt;/a&gt; in the first place or continues to accelerate, the next step is finding ways to block it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It raises the exciting possibility that adjusting the activity patterns of vulnerable neurons with drugs or deep brain stimulation could help protect them and slow disease progression," &lt;a href="https://gladstone.org/news/overworked-brain-cells-may-burn-out-parkinsons-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nakamura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98775.3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, pharmacies couldn’t administer the updated shots in Colorado &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/09/03/colorado-covid-vaccine-pharmacy-prescription/"&gt;unless a patient had a prescription&lt;/a&gt;. The state allows pharmacists to administer vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee, but not other shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge, chief medical officer for the state health department, responded by issuing a standing order — &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/29/cvs-walgreens-covid-vaccine-colorado/"&gt;essentially, a prescription for every resident&lt;/a&gt; – allowing them to get vaccinated at retail pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that order doesn’t guarantee insurance will cover the shots or that pharmacies will choose to stock them. Last year, fewer than half of people over 65 nationwide received an updated COVID-19 shot, with uptake dropping further in younger age groups, raising questions about whether health care providers will believe demand is high enough to justify buying the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The standing order provides accessibility. It doesn’t necessarily provide availability,” Calonge said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10dD2jbDYG82zQDn_J117zzYwhFfGraSh/view"&gt;Colorado Division of Insurance issued a draft rule&lt;/a&gt; last week that would require state-regulated plans to cover COVID-19 vaccines without out-of-pocket costs for people of any age, assuming the division passes it as written. Insurance cards from state-regulated plans typically have CO-DOI printed in the lower left corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s rule doesn’t apply to federally regulated plans, which account for about 30% of employer-sponsored insurance plans in Colorado, Calonge said. Typically, however, those plans try to offer competitive benefits, since they mostly serve large employers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My hope would be they would want to keep up with other insurers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time that people on state-regulated plans have had benefits not guaranteed for people with federally regulated insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado capped the cost of &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/02/13/colorado-insulin-cap-diabetes-pharmacy-confusion/"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/02/20/colorado-epipen-price-cap-pharmacies/"&gt;epinephrine&lt;/a&gt; shots to treat severe allergic reactions in state plans, but couldn’t require the same for plans the state doesn’t oversee. In those cases, it offered an “affordability program” requiring manufacturers to supply the medication at a lower cost for people who aren’t covered by the state caps, Medicare or Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two Colorado insurers surveyed by The Denver Post said all of their plans will cover COVID-19 vaccines, while others hedged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select Health, which sells Medicare and individual marketplace plans in Colorado, said its plans currently cover COVID-19 vaccines without out-of-pocket costs for everyone. Kaiser Permanente Colorado said in a message to members that it will pay for the shot for anyone 6 months or older.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Donna Lynne, CEO of Denver Health, said the health system’s insurance arm is waiting on clarification about when it should cover the vaccines. Denver Health Medical Plan offers multiple plan types, some state-regulated and some under federal rules, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s less of a decision on our part than understanding what the health department and the insurance department are saying,” she said. “You can’t have one insurance company saying they are doing it and one saying they aren’t doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthem said it considers immunizations “medically necessary” if the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians or the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee has recommended them, but didn’t specify whether it would charge out-of-pocket costs for medically necessary vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those bodies stated that certain people could get a particular vaccine — but not that they should — Anthem would decide about coverage “on an individual basis,” &lt;a href="https://www.anthem.com/medpolicies/abc/active/mp_pw_a044155.html"&gt;its website said&lt;/a&gt;. The other groups have recommended the shots for people over 18 or under 2, with the option for healthy children in between to get a booster if their parents wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s Medicaid program is still waiting for guidance from federal authorities about whose vaccines it can cover, according to the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-medicare-isnt-covering-updated-covid-shots-yet-rcna229338"&gt;Medicare isn’t yet paying for the shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the COVID-19 vaccines’ relatively brief existence, they were free and recommended for everyone 6 months and older. In 2024, the federal government stopped paying for them, which meant uninsured people no longer could be sure they could get the shot without paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all insurance plans still were required to pay for the shots, though, because the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous years, the committee recommended updated shots within days of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approving them. In late August, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/29/updated-coronavirus-vaccines-fda/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F44724e4%2F68b1d080f869983622e53f1e%2F5976735eae7e8a6816d68aba%2F16%2F66%2F68b1d080f869983622e53f1e"&gt;FDA approved the updated vaccines for people over 65 and those with one of about 30 conditions&lt;/a&gt; increasing their risk of severe disease, including asthma, obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors still could prescribe the vaccine “off-label” to healthy people, in the same way that they prescribe adult medications for children when an alternative specifically approved for kids isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, however, &lt;a href="https://www.healthbeat.org/atlanta/2025/08/29/georgia-covid-vaccine-prescription-pharmacies/?utm_source=healthbeat.beehiiv.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the-cdc-as-we-know-it-is-gone&amp;amp;_bhlid=5c4ef87b413a99b1542fe8dc2ebd872c0bd23f80"&gt;the committee won’t meet until Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, and may not recommend the shots when it does. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/06/17/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-fired-colorado-doctor/"&gt;dismissed all of the committee’s members earlier this year and replaced them with new appointees&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom oppose COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee’s decision also will determine whether the Vaccines for Children program can supply the shots for children who are uninsured, covered by Medicaid or are members of American Indian tribes, Calonge said. If the committee decides not to recommend the vaccines, those children likely won’t have another option to get the shots, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When states and the federal government passed laws linking coverage to the committee’s recommendations, they did so expecting that it would also remain an apolitical arbiter of the evidence for vaccinating the population or specific subgroups, said Cathy Bradley, dean of the Colorado School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that premise is in doubt, and states are looking for other ways to ensure access, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing anyone who wants a COVID-19 vaccine to get one from the provider of their choice is an important first step for Colorado, because the vaccines remain effective in preventing severe illness, Bradley said. As the situation develops, the state will likely need to come up with other partial solutions to preserve access, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a different path for everyone, depending on what your coverage is,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3uuc00123b7azxhalliw@published"&gt;My spouse and I are on a difficult journey through infertility struggles. We’ve had some pregnancy losses, and we’re currently pursuing treatment. During this time, we also became foster parents, with the goal of helping parents and children to reunify (privately, I felt that channeling my grief into helping other parents would be healing).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3uvr00133b7a2e3t3bbn@published"&gt;Our most recent foster case has transitioned to adoption. We love our soon-to-be son, though we had no idea he’d become legally ours when the case began. Suddenly, I’m very self-conscious about how this looks from the outside. I don’t personally believe that adoption is a solution for infertility, and our little boy is not a consolation prize. I find myself bristling at well-meaning comments from others (“You get to keep him!” being a common one) and I don’t want our toddler growing up thinking he was Plan B. How do I navigate the nuances of two traumatic experiences—our infertility, and our child’s removal from his first family—in social situations without promoting an unhealthy view of family-building?&lt;/p&gt;

Now the challenge is—as it so often is—dealing with others whose understanding is less nuanced, and who have the luxury of an offhand response.&lt;/p&gt;

Neither is it anyone’s business but your own. If there are people in your life—a sibling, a best friend, a parent—to whom you are accustomed to “telling everything,” then go ahead and tell them &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, including your reservations about adoption, your strong feelings about it not being a solution to infertility, and a confession of your anxiety about “how this looks.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v5200183b7a5nq47nyh@published"&gt;But since the cat is out of the bag with (most of?) the people in your life, I’d say you need to divide these well-wishers into two categories: those closest to you and everybody else. With Group 1, retroactively offer an accounting of everything you just told me. With Group 2, the appropriate response to their delighted congratulations (when offered while your son is still young enough not to understand, or when he isn’t present) is to say thanks, and move on to talking about something else. (And do not offer updates as they occur: Consider the discussion of both your efforts to become pregnant and your son’s adoption closed. When you do eventually become pregnant, and you want to share that news with the whole world, no matter what these people say—whether it’s, “OMG finally!” or even “You must be over the moon to be having ‘your own’”—stick to “Thanks.” There’s no percentage in correcting the assumptions of others, especially when the emotional cost to you is high.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="191" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v8b001a3b7a5e3bjkep@published"&gt;When it comes to your son, all you need to do to make sure he doesn’t feel like Plan B is to love and treasure him—I promise, if you do, he’ll know. And of course doing everything you can to support him through the traumatic loss of his first family (including recognizing that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a trauma—not by pointing this out to him and trying to process it with and for him, but by being available to him as he feels and processes it, and offering him resources to help him do so) will go a long way to ensure that he feels deeply loved and precious to you. In “social situations,” if anyone is thoughtless enough to say to &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, “Aren’t you a lucky boy?!” or, in his presence, to you, “Aren’t you lucky you got to keep him!” consider laughing, maybe responding with the ambiguous, “Luck has nothing to with it,” and then changing the subject (one of my most reliable go-to’s). Then, when you get home, ask him how the comment made him feel. And let him, for the zillionth time, know how very much you love him.&lt;/p&gt;

He lets them eat handfuls of candy and other things out of those self-serve bins. It’s not only unsanitary, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s stealing and setting a terrible example for them. Jack says he considers it “sampling.” I’m the main breadwinner in the family, and it’s my husband who is usually at home with the kids. It’s he who almost exclusively handles the shopping while I’m at work, which means I can’t be there to supervise what goes on. How can I put a stop to this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001q3b7areiyow5k@published"&gt;I’m with you: Letting the kids grab food out of the bins is a terrible idea. Along with what you’ve mentioned, it’s a lousy thing to do to everyone who buys food from that bin after your little germ-carriers have dipped their hands into it. (Your husband is lucky he hasn’t been kicked out of the store yet.) It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; petty theft—you might point out to your husband that “sampling” applies only to what’s offered for free by the store, not what’s taken from them without express permission—and allowing it indeed gives them the message that taking what isn’t theirs to take is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001r3b7a0epl8a4s@published"&gt;Try to say this in as non-accusatory a way as you can muster. “I know you don’t want to give them that message,” you might say (lovingly). “They’re too young to understand the subtle difference you understand between taking candy that’s not theirs from a store and taking it from friends, say.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001s3b7acts307e3@published"&gt;You might also point out (still keeping your tone level) that if others are doing what the kids are doing, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are picking up whatever others have been putting down. I know you’ve told him that this practice is “unsanitary,” but I’m guessing that spelling it out in gross detail—“If anyone who has a cold has just blown his nose and then stuck his hand in the bulk gummy worms bin, that cold is definitely going to be passed along to the next poor chump who reaches in for a handful of worms and bits of mucus”—will be more effective. (As my creative writing students know, concrete details will always be more effective than a summary.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vw0001t3b7a5wj0iais@published"&gt;I do want to offer one tip for a healthy, long-lasting marriage. Even though you’re right about this business with the bulk bins, in general, it isn’t fair to expect your children’s father to be responsible for their care while you supervise it from a distance. In other words: You’re not the foreman; he’s not the worker. So don’t &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; him he can’t do this anymore; don’t issue orders and don’t make the rules and expect him to follow them. Talk things over with him. In situations where his judgment proves to be less than the best &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; (theft is wrong; sticking hands in food that others may have stuck their hands in is begging for health trouble; sticking hands in food that others will take home to eat is selfish and mean), have a thoughtful conversation that helps him see things in a way that inspires him to make a better choice. And if he’s doing something with the kids that you don’t care for but that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; objectively bad, maybe keep your opinion to yourself. Nobody likes to have all the responsibility but none of the authority.&lt;/p&gt;

We have two kids, “Sarah,” who is 8, and “Travis,” 11. We left them with my sister, “Olive,” as the wedding was adults-only. During the reception, we got a call from Olive saying that Travis had crashed her car into a neighbor’s parked car while trying to drive off with hers. She said Travis had gotten into her purse and taken her keys while she was in the bathroom. Thankfully, our son wasn’t injured, but he did cause thousands of dollars’ worth of damage to her car and the neighbor’s car he hit.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, she wants my husband and me to pay for it. I say it’s her problem for allowing my son to gain access to her keys in the first place. He could have been killed. (If anything, Olive should be grateful we aren’t suing her!) We don’t owe her anything, right?&lt;/p&gt;

I would further have to assume that she didn’t take those warnings seriously, or she would either have refused your request that she babysit overnight, or locked her purse in a safe and hid all her valuable belongings. Perhaps she could have left her car in a neighbor’s garage, just to be extra safe.&lt;/p&gt;

You should also get him help immediately, whether through a family therapist, individual counselor, or both (stealing her car was not a harmless, run-of-the-mill prank; you’re right that he could have been killed—and so might others have been if he’d made it off your sister and her neighbor’s street). You should recognize that what Travis did is a harbinger of even worse to come if there isn’t an intervention now. You should apologize profusely to your sister.&lt;/p&gt;

Something is very wrong when you reduce an incident such as this to “I’m not giving you a red cent!” and a level of hostility to your sister that rises to your self-righteous assertion that she’s lucky you’re not (yet?) planning to sue her. If your disdain for her long predates this harrowing event, why did you leave her in charge of your children while you went out of town for a wedding? (Unless it wasn’t so much that you were entrusting them to her, but rather that it was a punishment for her past misdeeds.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a recent Senate hearing, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/04/rfk-jr-kennedy-deaths-covid-vaccines/85973432007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. whether he accepted the fact that COVID vaccines had saved the lives of almost 2 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think anybody knows,” Kennedy replied, “because there was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC.” Aware of multiple studies confirming this assessment, Warner shot back, “How can you be so ignorant?”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In an exchange with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Kennedy — who has frequently &lt;a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/fact-check-rfk-jr-misleads-on-autism-prevalence-causes/3854959/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;propagated&lt;/a&gt; discredited &lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/factcheck-org-kennedy-cites-flawed-paper-in-bid-to-justify-vaccine-autism-link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that childhood vaccines cause autism, which he now says is a “preventable disease” brought on by an “environmental toxin” — opined, without evidence, that mRNA vaccines produce “serious harm, including death, especially among young people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="k036p9v5" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After listening to the testimony, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a physician, stated he had “grown deeply concerned” about Kennedy’s leadership of HHS, because Americans now “don’t know who to rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combative Senate hearing demonstrated that an infectious disease — one that rejects scientific expertise, metastasizes conspiracy theories and contaminates programs that track and treat illnesses — has entered the body politic of America’s public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="k036p9v5" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“In terms of working scientists,” Kennedy announced in May, “our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that research continues.” A &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/federal-health-worker-cuts-rfk-trump-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;comprehensive study by ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;, however, reveals that more than 3,000 scientists and public health officials and 1,000 health and safety inspectors have resigned or been fired from the CDC, National Institutes of Health and FDA this year. That does not include those placed on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reductions of 20,000 staff — 18 percent of the HHS’s allegedly “bloated bureaucracies” — have resulted in fewer clinical trials of new drugs; fewer specialists planning for the next outbreak of a deadly virus; fewer inspections of egg farms, seafood processers, drug manufacturers and blood banks; and less monitoring and development of treatments to prevent heart disease, strokes and HIV/AIDS, maternal and infant health problems and oral hygiene issues of children whose parents can’t afford to pay a dentist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Draconian cuts in NIH and National Science Foundation grants have slowed or stopped vitally important research and may well end the careers of the next generation of first-rate scientists.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In late August, without consulting the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fact-checking-rfk-jr-s-claim-that-everybody-can-get-the-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt; the approved cohort for updated COVID-19 vaccines to people 65 or over, anyone older than six months who has an underlying condition, and patients who get a recommendation from their doctor.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/must-be-so-proud-rfk-sparks-outrage-for-breaking-vow-to-gop-senator/ar-AA1Gpjj1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;he had assured&lt;/a&gt; Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician, during his confirmation hearings that he would make no changes in the composition of the Advisory Committee, Kennedy then &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-17-person-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 of its members. The director of the CDC was fired as well, after less than a month in office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This infectious disease is now spreading to public agencies in the states. In April, Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/idaho-governor-works-on-final-bill-actions-including-signing-medical-freedom-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;signed legislation&lt;/a&gt; banning schools from mandating vaccines. Earlier this month, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/florida-surgeon-general-state-moving-end-vaccine-mandates/story?id=125224527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that he would work with the state legislature to repeal all vaccine requirements, including the immunization of public school students against diphtheria, measles, rubella, mumps, tetanus and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Every last one of them is wrong and drip with disdain and slavery,” Ladapo proclaimed. Vaccine mandates “take away your ability to choose what you put in your body and what you as a parent put in your child’s body.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until now, all 50 states and D.C. have mandated childhood vaccines. Many of them, including Florida, allow parents to request exemptions on religious grounds. In the 1905 case &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jacobson v. Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court ruled that compulsory vaccination laws do not violate the Constitution, stating that liberty “is not absolute in each person to be at all times and under all circumstances wholly freed from restraint.” The decision &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2004.055152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has been upheld&lt;/a&gt; several times since.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines “are among the most studied and scrutinized medical interventions in history,” the University of Florida Academic Health Center recently &lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/03/florida-vaccine-requirements-medical-experts-profoundly-concerned-desantis-ladapo/85959858007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emphasized&lt;/a&gt;. “They are proven to be safe, effective and essential in the spread of many infectious diseases. Public safety is a shared responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Since contact among children accelerates the spread of contagious diseases and &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=what-every-parent-should-know-about-immunizations-1-1750#:~:text=All%20vaccines%20are%20fully%20tested,the%20child%20from%20that%20disease." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the risk&lt;/a&gt; of serious side effects or death from vaccines is very small, removing the mandates, according to Lisa Gwynn, former president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, “could lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases, putting countless lives at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Florida may already be on the cusp of a resurgence. People with a “conspiracy mindset,” a recent study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/appc-people-conspiracy-mindset-resist-childhood-vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt;, are more likely to believe misinformation about vaccination. Perhaps for this reason, 5 percent of Florida’s parents &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/florida-vaccine-mandates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;requested vaccination exemptions&lt;/a&gt; for their children last year, above the national average. 88.1 percent of children in the state have been &lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/03/florida-vaccine-requirements-medical-experts-profoundly-concerned-desantis-ladapo/85959858007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough), less than the 92 to 94 percent required to reach herd immunity for pertussis. In 2024, reported cases of the illness in Florida skyrocketed from 85 to 715.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent outbreak of measles in Texas — which, with few exceptions, was confined to unvaccinated children — could make its way to the Sunshine State. All the more so, since Kennedy, ignoring the danger the disease poses to children, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-measles-vaccines_n_67d14ea8e4b0a41cd2d483c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; that catching measles to get “lifetime protection” is better than vaccination, which he asserts “does cause death every year.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For the record: Before 1963, about 500,000 Americans contracted measles each year, 500 of whom died. Following the introduction of vaccines, incidences declined by 95 percent and death became a very rare event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President Trump &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4956319-trump-says-hell-let-rfk-jr-go-wild-on-health-and-food-in-potential-second-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; to let RFK Jr. “go wild” on health and medicine. He has, alas, kept that promise. The result is that HHS agencies — once the envy of the world — and their counterparts in some states can no longer be relied upon to collect and disseminate accurate data, sponsor first-rate research, or implement policies to keep us healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a rule, the stories in our "following up" series look back at previous articles from Goats and Soda. But when freelance journalist Ruchi Kumar pitched the idea of following up on media coverage of a heart transplant for a 12-year-old girl, whose heart had been weakened by illness, we were interested. Doctors drove through one of the most brutal Russian attacks on Kyiv to collect a heart donated by the mother of a 4-year-old who had died of brain injuries from an accident. Here's a look at that extraordinary night — and how the girl with the transplant is now faring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="container large" id="cong-s1-87246-100"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;On the night of July 9, Dr. Borys Todurov, the director of the Kyiv Heart Institute, received a call from a colleague at the Ohmatdyt Hospital across the city. Earlier that evenings, a 4-year-old girl had died of brain injuries from an accident, and her parents had agreed to donate her organs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Todurov had a patient — Kira Skliarova, a 12-year-old girl from Luhansk region of Ukraine — who needed a new heart urgently. Childhood illnesses had severely weakened her own heart. "She was on the waiting list for a long time, and just one day before we implanted her with a mechanical heart, but she needed a transplant," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He had to risk his own life to complete the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The donor's body was located about 10 miles from the Heart Institute, which was on that evening under one of the heaviest Russian attacks since the start of the full-scale war in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There were Russian missiles and drones everywhere, the air raid alert was going off," he said. "But we had a chance to save a life so took it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Dg2zd1hia/" target="_blank"&gt;video made by Todurov&lt;/a&gt; shows their vehicle dodging explosions as Ukrainian air defenses fought off Russian drones. "On our way, we saw a lot of drones, and buildings that they targeted that were on fire," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88469" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Kira, center, still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life." Kira is flanked by her mother, right, and the mother of her heart donor, left.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl with a broken heart &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's family was displaced during the Russian invasion of their region in 2014 and moved to Kyiv as internally displaced refugees. In 2019, the girl developed a severe case of pneumonia, which eventually led to inflammation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with post-myocarditis condition, her mother Alyona Skliarova, told NPR over a phone call. For the next six years, Kira endured a rigorous drug treatment regime and was frequently in and out of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As her condition worsened, especially in the last six months, "her doctor told us, 'It's time to get her on a waiting list for a new heart,'" Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On July 8, her team of doctors decided the girl was facing imminent death and so operated to fit her with an artificial heart — an assistive device to help her body pump blood. "When I came to her [after the surgery], she was lying with that mechanism, with the whole thing on the outside, I could see the blood circulating. [It looked] like a suitcase, like the one we take with us when we go to the railway station," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I was so shocked, really shocked. That image was not for the faint-hearted people to see," she said. "I wondered, if there isn't a donor heart available, how long could one live with this suitcase device."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the attacks of July 9 began, Kira was in the ICU after her surgery. Her mother was in the hospital but had to go to a shelter because of the intense bombing. Her husband — Kira's dad — had died of COVID in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery under fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When news of the donor heart came, Todurov did not hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was a limited window of time to extract the organ and then transplant it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He and his crew — a scrub nurse, a surgeon and an anesthesiologist — drove to the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital amid the bombing and began the procedure, even as the ground beneath their feet shivered from the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"During the extraction, we could not only hear the noises of drones and missiles but also feel the vibrations of the explosion," he said. "We knew it was very, very dangerous, but once we had the heart, it would only be viable for a few hours outside the body, so we decided to transport it right away,"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Back at their own hospital, Todurov's team wasted no time to prep for the heart transplant — even as they felt the building shake from the explosions outside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing intensity of attacks, they forged ahead. "Surgeries need to be conducted with precision; you need attention, focus, and we are doing this with explosions around us. We are working to save lives, and they are killing civilians around us," Todurov said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A chance at a new life"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a very serious attack that night, but the whole time, I was praying to all the gods, Kira, Kira, Kira," her mother recalled. "Somehow we survived the night, and when the air raid alarms ended, I went to see Kira." Her daughter no longer needed to be connected to the artificial heart contraption. "I felt a relief," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our doctors — they are gods on earth. I am so grateful to them!"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first three days after the transplant were sensitive, her mother said, as her body adjusted to the new heart. "She lost some weight at first. Her organs didn't receive enough blood. and she was vomiting when she ate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After three days, Kira's body embraced her new heart and her health began to improve.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She has some issues with spasticity, where her muscle are stiffened, on the right side of her arm, leg and eye. But she is working with a rehabilitation therapist," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bittersweet moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's transplant has been a bittersweet moment for the mother of the donor — a 4-year old girl whose organs helped save two other lives that fateful night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mother of the donor visited Kira, said Aloyna Skliarova, "and listened to her daughter's heart beat in Kira's chest. On the one hand, that's a tragedy for [her]. On the other hand, it became a chance for life." She added with gratitude: "I respect her so much, and I'm so grateful for her decision. She gave my child a chance to live."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Mother and daughter are determined to make the best of this new lease at life. "I hope we will have more walks in parks, catch up on everything. There are a lot of things in Kyiv that we haven't yet seen, because we've spent these six years in hospitals or laying at home with the sickness," Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One dream is to visit the Carpathian Mountains. "I was there once and I want Kira to see this beauty, go for a walk, climb on [the mount] Khomyak," she said. "We are planning to live. Just to enjoy life, with this new heart. Only God knows what the future will be like, but yes, there is a will to live."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruchi Kumar is a journalist who reports on conflict, politics, development and culture in India and Afghanistan.

Your brain cannot think without iron,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is most prevalent in premenopausal women. “We think that about 30 million U.S. women have iron deficiency,” Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency can cause a host of issues, including a condition called iron deficiency anemia. “You can imagine it like a spectrum where iron deficiency without anemia is the milder version, and then if you get to a point where you have iron deficiency anemia ... if you get to that point where you’re that severe, then the symptoms are all the worse — more fatigue, more tiredness,” Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 15% of American women have iron deficiency anemia, and another 15 or 20% have iron deficiency without anemia, according to Fein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anemia ... means that the iron is low enough that the bone marrow has essentially failed to keep up.

This is often associated with more fatigue and lower mood. And while that is certainly true, iron deficiency can play a role here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptom of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is fatigue, “but difficulty concentrating, or poor concentration, that sort of mental fog ... is well noted,” Shatzel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of iron deficiency also include impaired memory and mood-related complications, Fein added. &lt;a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/news/archive/202305/could-low-iron-be-making-your-mental-health-symptoms-worse" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/news/archive/202305/could-low-iron-be-making-your-mental-health-symptoms-worse" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that low iron can worsen &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/depression" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="depression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/depression" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, too.

The problem can also be a sign of colon cancer, a gastric ulcer or even Celiac disease, according to Shatzel. These issues can happen in both men and women, but in men, the underlying cause of iron deficiency is &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-iron-deficiency" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="often more severe" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-iron-deficiency" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;often more severe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also been a rise in people getting gastric bypass weight loss surgery, “which causes iron deficiency on purpose by causing malabsorption of all nutrients,” Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s largely an issue among women with periods and bleeding disorders, Fein added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is common in pregnancy and can cause complications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is also common (and under-diagnosed) in pregnant people, according to both experts, which can be particularly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541841/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541841/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that iron deficiency can cause complications in pregnancy for both the mother and the baby, Shatzel noted. These include complications like preterm birth, low birth weight and &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/pregnancy" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="developmental delays" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/pregnancy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;developmental delays&lt;/a&gt;. If moms are fatigued already from low iron, they’re less able to push, resulting in more C-sections, Fein said. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/7246-cesarean-birth-c-section" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="C-sections are more risky" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/7246-cesarean-birth-c-section" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;C-sections are more risky&lt;/a&gt; than vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And this is a public health problem that affects Black people disproportionately, because it turns out that half of [pregnant] Black people have iron deficiency, and a third of non-Black [pregnant] people have iron deficiency,” Fein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy and can lead to problems for both the mother and the baby if untreated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treating low iron can improve quality of life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting iron levels to a healthy range not only brings your body back to where it should be, but can make life more enjoyable, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating iron deficiency is done in one of two ways, either by oral iron pills or IV therapy, Shatzel explained. The best remedy depends on the person. Your doctor can help you get the right treatment, but experts say IV iron often tends to be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, in rare cases, blood transfusions are necessary, Shatzel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to treat the underlying cause of iron deficiency, which for many women is heavy periods, and can benefit from birth control and other medical interventions, according to Shatzel. But since low iron can also be caused by GI issues, GI workups are sometimes necessary to figure out the best treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest thing in the general population is the quality of life. It’s pretty clear people feel better when they’re not anemic and their iron is at a good level,” Shatzel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency can make folks tired, unfocused and anxious, which impedes day-to-day functioning, whether that’s spending time with loved ones, going to work or heading out for a hike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10608302/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="With normal iron levels, athletic performance will likely improve" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10608302/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;With normal iron levels, athletic performance will likely improve&lt;/a&gt;, making that run, dance class or HIIT class a little less tiring.

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Kennedy has canceled millions of dollars in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research and fired the members of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions committee that makes vaccine recommendations, replacing some members with people who have been critical of vaccines. Last week, Floridaâ€™s surgeon general said the state &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-childhood-vaccines-mandate-eliminate-desantis-363323dcdd3811ca9ad7def5f9a30fb2" target="_blank"&gt;would do away with vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;, including for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana still requires students to get a handful of vaccinations, including ones that protect against polio, measles and diphtheria. But the state hasÂ one of the broadest exemption policies in the country,Â allowing parents to opt-out their children for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. In recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/legislature/anti-vaccine-movement-gains-steam-with-louisiana-politicians-heres-why-doctors-are-concerned/article_952ec988-2d8f-11ef-baad-e7ba32b5f435.html" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana legislators&lt;/a&gt; have passed laws targeting vaccines, including one that requires schools to publicize vaccine exemptions to parents.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Lately, the number of Louisiana families &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/vaccine-opt-out-rate-for-louisiana-children-skyrockets/article_92edc9ce-edef-11ee-b955-cb43fb1ab3f4.html" target="_blank"&gt;declining to vaccinate their children has skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt;, alarming public health experts. The rate of families requesting vaccine exemptions for kindergartens reached its highest point in a decade during the 2022-23 school year, and it has continued to rise, with 3% of families requesting nonmedical exemptions last school year, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sense of the changes, the Times-Picayune spoke with Charles Stoecker, a health care economist at Tulane University &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b9Y9R_oAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;who studies vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt;. Stoecker discussed the recent rise in vaccine skepticism and argued that the decline in childhood vaccinations could seriously threaten public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk about vaccines that protect against pneumonia, which you've studied.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Around 2000, we developed a version of pneumococcal vaccine that took a Diphtheria-causing toxinÂ â€” something that your body really reacts hard toÂ â€” scooped out all the bad parts of it and put in something that looked like the stuff that causes pneumonia and that takes really well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults, effectiveness might wane over time, but for kids, itâ€™s almost magical. Itâ€™s nearly 100% effective against certain strains of pneumonia and seems to last for the duration of childhood. This was a huge step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the development of that vaccine impact public health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s cool to see how disease patterns in adults change when we vaccinate the kids. When kids started getting this magic (pneumococcal) vaccine around 2000, adult levels became nearly undetectable for those strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re vaccinating the kids so kids canâ€™t get the diseases from each other. (But) even if you donâ€™t have pneumonia, you may carry some of those bacteria around in your nose and youâ€™re coming home to grandma. Since you have this vaccine, itâ€™s not in your nose and youâ€™re not breathing on grandma, and she canâ€™t wind up in the hospital from pneumonia. And of course, it protects the kids themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has vaccine buy-in changed since the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During COVID, a bunch of doctors' offices closed and kids couldnâ€™t get appointments, so we saw vaccination rates go down. Weâ€™ve bounced back up, but not quite to pre-pandemic levels. Thereâ€™s something that fundamentally changed about peopleâ€™s perceptions of the necessity of vaccines during COVID. Iâ€™m not sure exactly what that is, but itâ€™s bad for public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity is a patchwork quilt. State-level vaccination rates can hide a lot of heterogeneity. Pre-COVID, wealthy schools wouldnâ€™t vaccinate their kids and would have lower vaccination rates and theyâ€™d have outbreaks of measles or pertussis and thatâ€™s where they were concentrated. Post-pandemic, state-level vaccination rates fell, but they donâ€™t fall equally. Some schools have lower vaccination rates than others.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are school vaccine mandates effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The societal bargain weâ€™ve struck is that we will educate your kids for free â€” through tax revenue but you donâ€™t spend any money â€” so your kids get an education and are able to make a better wage later. Plus, you get free babysitting while theyâ€™re there and you can go to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In return, we require you to vaccinate your kids. You may not want to vaccinate your kids because itâ€™s a pain to take them to the doctor or they get fussy or you have other concerns. But we know the vaccines are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;This bargain started about 150 years ago and thatâ€™s about when we started to see these dramatic declines in infectious disease. It used to be that one-fifth of kids died before they hit 5, and now itâ€™s very rare to have a kid die before age 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How could policy changes, including doing away with vaccine mandates for schoolchildren, impact public health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think itâ€™s rewinding our disease environment to a place we have not seen in 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These diseases are not present of mind because weâ€™ve done such a good job preventing their transmission largely through school-based vaccination programs. Not all vaccines are as great as pneumococcal â€” some are less effective â€” and some kids canâ€™t get the vaccines because they have cancer or something that makes it not recommended. (But) those kids that are vaccinated protect themselves, protect other kids and their parents and their grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;(Floridaâ€™s policy) is going to kick out that critical leg of protection. We donâ€™t know exactly whatâ€™s going to happen, but weâ€™ve seen what has happened when we havenâ€™t had that leg. Itâ€™s hard to imagine that people wonâ€™t get seriously sick and possibly die because of these policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Know yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the finest books to keep you on track is &lt;em&gt;The Brave Athlete: Calm the F*ck Down&lt;/em&gt;, written by Dr Simon Marshall and multiple off-road triathlon world champion Lesley Paterson, and published in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Marshall a few years ago (before he sadly died in 2024) and, as is illustrated in the book, he was a master at helping folk hit their goals through a mixture of psychology and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many takeaways from that enlightening chat, but here are three of the key ones…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people are outcome-focused, meaning they don’t concentrate on the smaller victories before the bigger win (which more often than not, is never reached, because of not focusing on the smaller wins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach sidesteps the most important element of goal-setting biology – the neurotransmitter dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s associated with pleasure, dopamine’s main role is keeping us on the right path toward hitting our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you teach yourself to microdose dopamine at regular intervals, you’ll receive a happy-hormone squirt that’ll please your brain and crank up the encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To open the dopamine floodgates, Marshall said, try to watch and listen to inspirational material, especially before a ride or meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an individual thing, but you can’t go wrong with YouTube hits of athletes overcoming adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to self-control, early mornings are almost always better for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists have discovered that we find it harder to take on a challenge the later in the day it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/GettyImages-2180335248.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-938617"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Exercising earlier in the morning is easier to do from a motivation perspective. Getty Images &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because the part of your brain responsible for self-control (the anterior cingulate cortex) tires just like a muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your emotional reserves to tackle a challenge and tolerate discomfort are eroded throughout the day because you’re constantly resisting temptation, stifling emotion and otherwise exerting self-restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why dreaming of a large glass of red wine at home becomes more appealing than mounting your smart trainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you have the choice, work with your anterior cingulate cortex and train early in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p purpleid="d3d8663a-1f1a-41ed-aa55-db2e810b8419"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brick by brick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling to cope with the bigger picture, be it a long session or consistent training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segment it. Why? Because your brain likes things in manageable chunks, and if things become tough, it deals with them better when not looking too far into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking, “I can’t suffer this for 60 minutes”, think, “I can do 10 minutes”. Instead of “I can’t exercise regularly for eight weeks”, think, “I can get through today”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do that and it’ll be much easier, partly because of point one. Every time you tick off a segment, you’ll receive a motivating shot of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand your mind and motivation, Marshall also recommended reading &lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt; by James Clear and &lt;em&gt;Mindset&lt;/em&gt; by Carol Dweck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
