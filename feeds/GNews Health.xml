            Doctors in China say they transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a 71-year-old man who lived 171 days after the procedure, and 38 of those days were with the pig organ in place – a first to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgicv29g00033b6q1y58ckxc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have had early success transplanting genetically modified pig kidneys and hearts into humans, and pig livers have been transplanted into people who were brain-dead. But experts in the field of xenotransplantation – using animal organs in people – have had some concerns about whether the liver would be a good candidate for such a procedure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgigtkpi0000336nsja8xfki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone always says, ‘oh, liver is too complicated to transplant, compared to the heart or kidney,’ but after this, in the future, I think people will think differently. I think liver is good if we can get enough human genes in the pig,” said Dr. Beicheng Sun, president of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and a co-author of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40002336ncg1z0pse@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike hearts and kidneys that have more narrow functions, the liver is more complicated to replace with a pig organ because it’s large and has a dual blood supply and multiple functions. The liver filters blood, removes toxins and waste, processes nutrients, detoxifies harmful substances like alcohol and drugs, produces bile to help with digestion, produces proteins that help blood clot and plays an important role in regulating blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Last year, doctors at &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/january/first-successful-external-liver-perfusion-using-a-porcine-liver" target="_blank"&gt;Penn Medicine&lt;/a&gt; did the world’s first known successful external liver perfusion using a gene-edited pig organ. Blood from a brain-dead patient circulated through a pig liver outside the person’s body. In that case, the pig liver showed no signs of inflammation in the 72 hours it was tested, and the patient’s body remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000a336nghtl25vv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A transplanted pig liver &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/pig-liver-human-transplant-china"&gt;given to a brain-dead patient&lt;/a&gt; in China in March 2024 was removed at their family’s request 10 days after surgery. There had been no signs of immune rejection or accumulation of inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40003336nlzvtv61h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the new study, published Thursday in the Journal of Hepatology, suggests that pig-to-human liver transplantation shows promise for use as a bridge to help a human who has a serious liver condition live long enough for enough of their own liver to recover or for a donor human liver to became available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgigxih90005336na8ie8t0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the future, maybe the left side can get a real chance to regenerate, and in that case, we would remove the graft, and that would be enough to support the life, or at least we know we can wait one or two months for a graft from a human that could save his life. I think this is a very key finding,” Sun said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40004336nnmte972w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more than 100,000 people on organ transplant waiting lists &lt;a href="https://unos.org/data/#:~:text=Improve.,of%20today%201:00pm%20EDT" target="_blank"&gt;in the US alone&lt;/a&gt; and more than 9,000 waiting for a liver transplant, the demand for human organs far outpaces the supply. Livers are the second biggest need after kidneys, &lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;according to the US Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/a&gt; Scientists have been exploring alternatives for decades, including using pig organs because of their similarity to human organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40005336nl0r450os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case described in the new paper, doctors at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhul Medical University in China transplanted a liver from an 11-month-old pig into a 71-year-old man in May 2024. The pig, a clone, had 10 gene edits to reduce the possibility of infection or rejection of the organ. Doctors also gave the man drugs to suppress his immune system to keep his body from rejecting the foreign organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40006336ncojz3vhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The man had initially been hospitalized for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, a condition in which scar tissue replaces healthy tissue, impairing the function of the liver and sometimes leading to liver failure. He also had a large tumor in the right lobe of his liver, but efforts to shrink the tumor with a high concentration of chemotherapy targeted to its blood supply were unsuccessful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgid4zkn00053b6qmqtyb50m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In some cases like this, surgeons can surgically remove a part of the liver, but the researchers behind the new study said that what was left of the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;man’s liver would probably have been too small to meet his metabolic needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40007336ne78kkaii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After almost three weeks in the hospital, the man developed severe abdominal pain, and tests showed that the tumor was in danger of rupturing. Doctors tested family members to see whether they could donate liver tissue, but no one was a good match, so a gene-edited pig liver was considered the only remaining option that could save the man’s life. He and his daughter discussed the experiment with the doctors and agreed to proceed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgihofta000e336nturyge22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to have great respect for this patient and their family,” Sun said. “The patient provides such a special contribution to the field of this science, and we need to be grateful for all of these patients who have made such a big contribution to this field.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40008336n53gt4wae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors removed the tumor and the transplanted the genetically modified pig liver onto&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;what was left of the man’s liver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40009336nuecfnzxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The transplant seemed successful. Right away, the pig liver turned red, and bile – which helps remove waste products and aids in the absorption of fats – started draining from the external bile duct, with secretion progressively increasing over time. Within the first day, there was a significant increase in other liver function indicators, and there were no initial signs of inflammation or rejection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgide7xv00093b6quy24dri7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were no signs of acute rejection in the man’s body at day 10 after the surgery, the researchers say. Rather, what remained of the left side of the man’s liver seemed to be performing better than it had pre-surgery. An ultrasound showed that the portal vein, hepatic artery and hepatic vein blood flow in the transplanted pig liver were performing normally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000c336najg95uhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But by day 25, the patient’s heart started showing progressive signs of stress. Tests on day 28 and 33 showed inflammatory changes related to the transplant, and doctors swapped out some of the immune-weakening drugs. But there were other signs that the transplant wasn’t working as well as it did at first, suggesting that the man had developed a condition called xenotransplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, in which microscopic blood clots damage small blood vessels and organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000d336nmh98gy7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On day 37, the man’s blood pressure plummeted and his heart rate increased, and he was in and out of consciousness. At that point, his own liver was considered capable of functioning enough to keep his body going, so doctors removed the pig organ on day 38. The man’s liver continued to function well afterward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgidvv46000k3b6qwqauez0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On day 135, the man developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and he died of this bleeding 171 days after the transplant procedure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000e336ndzuceb9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study authors say the research gave them critical insight into the challenges and the feasibility of such a transplant. It showed that pig-to-human liver transplantation “can provide effective hepatic support while preserving part of the native liver, confirming its clinical feasibility as a bridging strategy,” they wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000f336nqvpdcevq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Heiner Wedemeyer, a professor and chairman of the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Infectious Diseases and Endocrinology at Hannover Medical School in Germany who co-authored an editorial that was published alongside the study Thursday, wrote that the experiment showed “a cause for cautious optimism” as well as a “reminder of how far the field must still travel.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000g336nnn4ee1zc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really groundbreaking,” Wedemeyer told CNN. “For me as a transplant hepatologist, it really opens completely new views and ideas.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgih79m8000b336nqz5m4dey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wedemeyer said he saw a patient Wednesday morning who had acute liver failure and did not qualify for transplantation with a human organ because of some cancer issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgii4cp0000r3b6qirge4on9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I would have had, at this stage, use of a pig liver to bridge her – because she may need three, four, five, six, seven weeks to recover with her own liver – I would have done this,” he said. “A pig liver gives us completely new opportunities, and that can really be promising for our patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When humanity ventures out into the final frontier, we won't be alone. &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1925483/possible-alien-origins-mysterious-object/" target="_blank"&gt;I'm not talking about extraterrestrial life&lt;/a&gt;, but the Earth-based life that we'll bring with us. Russia returned a research satellite last week that was carrying 75 mice, over 1,500 flies, microorganisms, plant seeds and cell cultures. The Bion-M No. 2 satellite was launched in August to conduct over 30 experiments in low Earth orbit, furthering our understanding of how life functions in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The mission, a joint effort between Roscosmos and Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems, concluded with a landing in the steppes of the Orenburg region. &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/russian-noahs-ark-probe-carrying-75-mice-and-1-500-flies-lands-back-on-earth" target="_blank"&gt;According to Space.com,&lt;/a&gt; the descent module was nicknamed Noah's Ark because of how it was stuffed with animal life. The scorching hot capsule sparked a brush fire, but it was quickly extinguished so scientists could retrieve their experiments on-site. Unlike early Soviet spaceflights with animals, most famously Laika, this ark needed to return to Earth with living occupants. Unfortunately, ten mice didn't survive the mission. Specialists assessed whether the flies onboard had sustained damage to their nervous systems after the trip to space.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While the space zoo would imply that the experiments were conducted solely for animal research, the work done was intended to assist future long-term human space trips. Experiments aimed to develop life support systems that can endure both prolonged weightlessness and cosmic radiation and improve the radiation safety of crewed spacecraft. However, one of the experiments on the spacecraft sought to test the theory of panspermia. The unproven theory posits that all of life on Earth was brought here as bacteria riding asteroids. The experiment itself involved testing whether bacteria on basalt rocks could survive atmospheric re-entry. The results have yet to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaceflight may never be boring, but it's in a rough place at the moment. Roscosmos is a shadow of its former self, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1842246/us-blocks-countries-rival-moon-base-project-china-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;crushing the country's ability to collaborate&lt;/a&gt; with Western institutions. The race to return to the Moon is quickly becoming a one-horse affair as &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1855263/trump-6-billion-nasa-funding-cut-jeopardizes-china-moon-race/" target="_blank"&gt;the Trump administration has laid off thousands of NASA's employees and canceled already paid-for missions.&lt;/a&gt; The China Manned Space Agency is now positioned to be the first to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon, immediately making China the world's preeminent space power.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

But a virus currently surging in the Bay Area is one many people may not be aware of: enterovirus D68. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Stanford University’s wastewater monitoring program show &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22San%20Jose,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22c8d357b9%22%7D&amp;amp;plantId=c8d357b9&amp;amp;charts=CjEQACABSABaBUVWRDY4cgoyMDI1LTA4LTI3cgoyMDI1LTEwLTA4igEGM2Y2NTBmwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=3f650f&amp;amp;locationExpanded=true&amp;amp;target=EVD68" data-link="native" class=""&gt;high levels&lt;/a&gt; of enterovirus D68 in San Jose and parts of San Francisco. This RNA respiratory virus is known to cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;respiratory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=enteroviruses-in-children-160-63" data-link="native" class=""&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt; and in some rare cases neurological symptoms, including meningitis and polio-like muscle weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the spike isn’t unusual. A mix of enteroviruses is known to spread every year, primarily in the late summer and early fall, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at UCSF, told SFGATE that most people end up with cases that are mild and include runny nose and cough. In some rare cases, the virus can infect the protective covering around the spinal cord and brain, causing meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see a lot of patients in the hospital who come in, they’ll have a headache, will do a lumbar puncture … and they’ll actually have enterovirus in there,” Gandhi said. She explained that when people develop meningitis related to enterovirus it is often much more mild than bacterial meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re “totally functional, you know, but they’ll have a mild headache,” Gandhi said of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with severe symptoms can end up hospitalized for respiratory therapy. One especially frightening effect of enterovirus D68 is a potentially dangerous neurological condition called acute flaccid myelitis. In this case, the person affected, usually a child, develops serious &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/enterovirus/spread-enterovirus-d68-linked-polio-illness-may-have-risen-50-over-10-years" data-link="native" class=""&gt;“polio-like” symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including muscle weakness that can lead to permanent paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be very scary, but it’s very rare,” Gandhi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no vaccine to protect against the enterovirus D68 and no cure.

&lt;p&gt;And what about the lungs? A number of things could explain the problems in his lungs—including infections from soil bacteria he might encounter in his construction work or a parasitic infection found in Central America. But the cause that best fit was common pneumonia and, more specifically, based on the distribution of opacities in his lung, pneumonia caused by aspiration (inhaling food particles or other things that are not air)—which is something that can happen when people drink excessive amounts of alcohol, as the man regularly did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ethanol impairs consciousness and blunts protective reflexes (e.g., cough and gag), which disrupts the normal control mechanisms of the upper aerodigestive tract," Dhaliwal noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where Dhaliwal made a critical connection. If the man's drinking led him to develop aspiration pneumonia—accidentally getting food in his lungs—he may have also accidentally gotten nonfood in this gastrointestinal tract at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critical connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things people most commonly swallow by accident include coins, button batteries, jewelry, and small bones. But these things tend to show up in imaging, and none of the imaging revealed a swallowed object. Things that don't show up on images, though, are things made of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This reasoning leads to the search for an organic object that might be ingested while eating and drinking and is seemingly harmless but becomes invasive upon entering the gastrointestinal tract," Dhaliwal wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The leading suspect," he concluded, "is a wooden toothpick—an object commonly found in club sandwiches and used for dental hygiene. Toothpick ingestions often go unnoticed, but once identified, they are considered medical emergencies owing to their propensity to cause visceral perforation and vascular injury."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a toothpick had pierced the man's duodenum, it would completely explain of all the man's symptoms. He drank too much and lost control of his aerodigestive tract, leading to aspiration that caused pneumonia, and he then swallowed a toothpick, which perforated the duodenum and led to sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhaliwal recommended an endoscopic procedure to look for a toothpick in his intestines. On the man's third day in the hospital, he had the procedure, and, sure enough, there was a toothpick, piercing through his duodenum and into his right kidney, just as Dhaliwal had deduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors promptly removed it and treated the man with antibiotics. He went on to make a full recovery. At a nine-month follow-up, he continued to do well and had maintained abstinence from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — Three people have died and 15 have been hospitalized by &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile Virus in Missouri&lt;/a&gt; as of Oct. 4, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 16 cases have been confirmed in the state, but more are under investigation. Health officials said virus levels are the highest the state has seen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is surging throughout the state and across the country, with &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cases running 40% higher than normal nationwide&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 770 cases, including 490 severe cases, were identified in early September, compared with the 550 cases, including 350 severe cases, usually reported during this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“West Nile virus is a serious public health concern, and this year’s increase in cases is a reminder that we must remain vigilant,” said Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services State Epidemiologist George Turabelidze said in a press release on Wednesday. “We are asking all Missourians to take simple but effective steps to protect themselves and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said West Nile Virus infections often cause no symptoms, but 1 in 5 people may develop a flu-like illness along with fever, headache, and body aches. Older individuals or people with weakened immune systems can also experience brain swelling or paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department shared the following ways people can protect themselves from the virus, including:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The symptoms are uncomfortable, and they can come for you &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/colds"&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt; a year. If you’re lucky enough to not get &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;sick, you get the unique misery of getting all your normal work done while buried under a mountain of tissues and the mental refrain &lt;em&gt;How did I ever forget how wonderful life is when you don’t have a runny nose? &lt;/em&gt;The common cold isn’t just a nuisance, though. It carries significant economic effects, causing an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/215118"&gt;estimated $40 billion in losses&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. each year from health care costs and missed work days. And for many people with underlying respiratory illnesses like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aka COPD, it poses a serious threat in the same way that flu, COVID, and pneumonia are more deadly in vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8y9001n3b78img45pup@published"&gt;Despite regularly meeting the cold on the front lines, we have relatively few weapons to fight it. There’s a litany of cough syrups, but &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40272-020-00420-4"&gt;many are outright ineffective&lt;/a&gt;. Vitamin C &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/myths-and-truths-about-vitamin-c"&gt;shorten the length&lt;/a&gt; of a cold, but it won’t prevent one. Antibiotics do nothing to fight viruses (and they do lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/well/antibiotic-resistance.html"&gt;antibacterial resistance&lt;/a&gt;). And, of course, there’s no cold vaccine, while you can go get a protective flu or COVID jab when fall weather rolls around. All you can really do is wash your hands a lot and prepare to grit your teeth through the eventual infection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8y9001o3b78rp3likn0@published"&gt;Why are we so ill-prepared for the common cold? It’s not because the common cold has been neglected by scientists or vaccine manufacturers, but because it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/06/why-cant-we-cure-the-common-cold"&gt;actually a really wily opponent&lt;/a&gt;. If researchers in the field “thought that a vaccine was something that could be achieved, they would already have done it,” says Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine and allergy at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London and a world expert in respiratory medicine research.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001p3b780wsqwbz2@published"&gt;For the past 18 years, Johnston has been working on achieving exactly that. And he thinks we’re close(ish) to the next step. I reached out to him to learn the latest. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001q3b7837vugs5a@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slate: Can you give us a little background as to why the common cold is a particularly difficult nut to crack?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001r3b781qs4pbon@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastian Johnston:&lt;/strong&gt; The basic reason is the sheer number of different viruses that cause common colds. Pretty much any respiratory virus can cause a common cold. Some of those already do have vaccines, like influenza, COVID, and RSV. But they’re generally reserved for more vulnerable populations, like older people and people with comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001s3b782fy2wz48@published"&gt;While any respiratory virus can cause a common cold, the biggest family are rhinoviruses—I would say probably three-quarters to four-fifths of common colds are caused by a rhinovirus infection. And the reason there is not a rhinovirus vaccine is because there are about 180 different rhinoviruses circulating, and they’re all distinct from each other. To get a vaccine that covers 180 different viruses is technologically extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001t3b78mdwj4twm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have you been tackling that challenge in your own research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001u3b78i1rfy850@published"&gt;Our aim has been to develop a vaccine that works through T-cells rather than antibodies. Humans have multiple arms of our immune systems that protect us against infections. Antibodies are very important, and producing antibodies against individual viruses is probably the most important thing that protects us against infections. But the problem with antibodies for rhinoviruses is that they don’t cross-react from one virus to another, so you’d need a vaccine with 180 different virus proteins in it to produce an effective antibody-producing virus.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001v3b787bocssg5@published"&gt;Then there are T cells, which are also part of the cellular immune response to infection. They have antiviral activity by themselves, but they also promote antibody production by stimulating the cells that produce antibodies. [We found that] if we promoted T-cell responses against rhinoviruses, that &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;cross-react among all 180 different rhinoviruses, and they would both have antiviral activity through the T cells themselves and also boost antibody production against those viruses through the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001x3b785yfr5wyt@published"&gt;What we’ve shown in mice and monkeys is that you can induce T-cell immune responses to a broad range of rhinoviruses—we’ve studied about 20 of them, which are pretty representative of the entire 180—and get very strong immune responses. We boost antibody production, and we clear virus faster. So everything that we’re seeing in mice and monkeys is telling us that it ought to work in man. But we haven’t yet shown that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yc001y3b787x07p9ox@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will that entail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yc001z3b78zja510sd@published"&gt;We’re working with &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/247454/apollo-therapeutics-raises-2265m-develop-medicines/"&gt;Apollo Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, who are committed to going into safety testing and then seeing whether it works in people by doing clinical trials. We hope that those studies will start later this year or early next year. We’re going to start with people with a chronic lung disease called COPD, because when they get a rhinovirus infection, they frequently end up in hospital, and so the cost [to the health care system] is obviously much higher than people getting common colds. If it’s successful in COPD, we would probably then broaden it to other chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and other chronic lung diseases. If it’s successful in those, we’ll probably broaden it to older people and immunosuppressed populations. And eventually, if it’s very safe and the cost has come down sufficiently to justify using it for the common cold, I see no reason why it shouldn’t eventually be used for the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00203b780ks2icbj@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any idea how long that could take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00213b7858lbupy4@published"&gt;Once Apollo has done their safety tests, they would then commit to testing whether it works or not, and we would probably look to get an answer a couple of years down the line. They’re quite long-duration studies, because you have to wait for naturally occurring colds to happen in the population that you’re studying. And then from there it usually does take some years to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00223b78o3gslxx6@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic gave a huge push to mRNA technology research over the last several years. Has that sped up the prospect of a rhinovirus vaccine at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00233b78tvvb7b7r@published"&gt;It did give a boost. But it hasn’t changed what we’re doing in any major way. We did look at developing an mRNA vaccine for rhinoviruses, but in the end, we decided to go with a protein vaccine with an adjuvant. That’s the standard approach for most vaccines, because the antibody responses that you get are actually stronger with a protein and an adjuvant than with an mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00243b7865lm5zlo@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re based in the UK, but I’m sure you’ve heard about the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/09/covid-vaccine-flu-shots-2025-florida-new-york-robert-f-kennedy-jr.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;attack on vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; happening across the pond. Has that affected your work at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00253b78fgq9vi9j@published"&gt;It hasn’t touched the UK in the same way, but a lot of drug development occurs in the United States, and a lot of clinical trial centers are in the United States, so I expect it has impacted Apollo’s thinking about where they want to do their studies. Obviously we don’t consider it to be a good thing. But there’s not much we can do to influence it at the moment, other than provide good data showing that it works. That’s the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="16" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ye00263b78yglhzcuf@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, so we can’t yet prevent the common cold. Are we getting closer to better treatments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ye00273b782zfdv5kc@published"&gt;Developing antivirals is something that many companies have tried, but so far, there is not a rhinovirus antiviral that is licensed and available for use. There was one that got quite a long way, but unfortunately it was found to interact with other drugs, and ultimately it was not approved.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ye00283b783d74ppoa@published"&gt;There is another drug called &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/altesa-biosciences-details-positive-topline-vapendavir-results-from-phase-2-placebo-controlled-rhinovirus-challenge-study-in-copd-patients-302448650.html"&gt;Vapendavir&lt;/a&gt; that looks promising. We recently carried out a study giving rhinovirus infection to people with COPD to induce a worsening of their COPD—so, mimicking the attacks that happen in the natural setting—and I’m happy to say that it gave positive results. We reduced symptom severity; we sped up time to recovery; we reduced virus loads; we showed reduced inflammation in markers of inflammation in the blood; and we improved lung function. So all of those were positive outcomes, and the company that licensed it is currently looking for investment to do a large clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yf002a3b78jxrdiibk@published"&gt;To be honest, I do nothing. I’m lucky that I’ve got, I think, good antiviral immunity—most of my colds are mild. But if I had a significant cold, I’d take some &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/paracetamol.html"&gt;paracetamol&lt;/a&gt;. And if I were a vulnerable person who got ill, I would take &lt;a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2024/07/overcounter-nasal-sprays-could-keep-colds-and-flu-at-bay-study-finds.page"&gt;First Defence&lt;/a&gt;, or one of those sprays that has been shown to shorten the illness duration by about a day, because that’s better than another day being ill.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yg002b3b78a3sbc7hq@published"&gt;Also, echinacea is a pretty harmless herbal treatment that does appear to have significant protection. I started off pretty skeptical about echinacea, but actually, I’m an author on studies showing that echinacea &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40001-021-00499-6"&gt;reduces antibiotic usage by about 70 percent in children&lt;/a&gt; if they use it as a prophylaxis. Antibiotic use is driven largely by common colds, which produce secondary bacterial things like sore throat, earache, nasal congestion, sinusitis.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m wishing things could move a little faster, because I’m confident that things are developing in the right way, and that we will have a vaccine and treatments for rhinoviruses and other common cold viruses before too &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening the muscles, lungs, and heart, regular physical exercise also strengthens the immune system. This finding comes from a study of older adults with a history of endurance training, which involves prolonged physical activity such as long-distance running, cycling, swimming, rowing, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers analyzed the defense cells of these individuals and found that "natural killer" cells, which patrol the body against viruses and diseased cells, were more adaptable, less inflammatory, and metabolically more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-06057-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, investigated natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) that can destroy infected and diseased cells, including cancer cells. They are at the forefront of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; because they detect and fight viruses and other pathogens. The researchers analyzed the cells of nine individuals with an average age of 64, divided into two groups: untrained and trained in endurance exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a previous study, we found that obesity and a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sedentary+lifestyle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; can trigger a process of premature aging of defense cells. This made us want to investigate the other side of the story; that is, whether an older adult who has been practicing endurance exercises for more than 20 years may have a better-prepared immune system. And that's indeed what we found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, NK cells functioned better in the face of an inflammatory challenge, in addition to using energy more efficiently. Therefore, it's as if exercise also trains the immune system," says Luciele Minuzzi, a visiting researcher at Justus Liebig University Giessen (JLU) in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the result of Minuzzi's postdoctoral research and is part of a larger research project led by São Paulo State University (UNESP) researchers in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study's findings, regular endurance training modulates the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory response&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we compared the cells of trained older adults with those of non-athletes of the same age, we found that those with a history of endurance exercise had fewer inflammatory markers and more anti-inflammatory markers. This means that compared to non-athletic older adults, they had much better control of inflammation," says Fábio Lira, a professor at the Faculty of Science and Technology (FCT-UNESP), Presidente Prudente campus, and project coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lira points out that the immune system can be influenced by several factors, such as sleep quality, diet, and vaccination, as well as stress, a sedentary lifestyle, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce the activity of defense cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Physical exercise is one of these factors that can benefit the immune system, and in this research project, we're investigating how it can modulate the immune response over time," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Changes in the cell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to analyzing the phenotype, function, and mitochondrial metabolism of NK cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, the researchers exposed expanded NK cells from trained and untrained older adults to different pharmacological blockers, such as propranolol and rapamycin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Trained older individuals demonstrate more efficient and adaptable immunity, with greater metabolic control and less propensity for cellular exhaustion. Regular physical exercise appears to positively modulate both adrenergic sensitivity and cellular energy sensors, promoting a more balanced and less inflammatory response to external stimuli," says Minuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propranolol is a drug that blocks the adrenergic pathway, the neural and endocrine circuit that releases neurotransmitters such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. It was used to isolate the role of this activation/mobilization pathway in NK cells. Rapamycin, on the other hand, inhibits the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is related to the control of cell growth and proliferation. In the study, rapamycin altered the phenotype of NK cells and decreased their expansion in vitro at high doses (100 ng/mL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In both cases, even with the blocking of signaling pathways, the NK cells of the trained older adults were able to maintain their immune function, while the cells of the untrained individuals showed cellular exhaustion or failure in the inflammatory response. This means that long-term endurance training is associated with protective 'immunometabolic' adaptations in NK cells in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In other words, the cells become more mature and effective, less senescent, and metabolically better prepared to respond to inflammatory or pharmacological stressors," says Minuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Inflammatory response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1601405/full" target="_blank"&gt;another recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, the same group of researchers had compared the immune response of young and master athletes before and after an acute exercise session. To do this, they analyzed whole blood and PBMC (the mononuclear fraction of blood formed by lymphocytes and monocytes, which includes NK cells) data from 12 master athletes (with an average age of 52 and more than 20 years of continuous training) and compared it with data from young athletes (with an average age of 22 and more than four years dedicated to training).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the master athletes had a more controlled inflammatory response than the younger athletes. When their blood cells were stimulated with a pathogen (LPS), both groups produced more IL-6, a cytokine that signals inflammation. However, the increase was more pronounced in young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Another important inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, was only increased in the younger group," says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+athletes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young athletes&lt;/a&gt; showed a more intense inflammatory response, while the older athletes showed a more regulated and controlled profile. According to the researchers, this suggests that lifelong training can promote beneficial, balanced immune adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because they train regularly, their bodies are accustomed to dealing with inflammatory episodes, which require more intense stimuli to generate significant long-term inflammatory responses. It's this type of 'training' that—over time—adapts the immune system, making it stronger," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minuzzi points out that research on immune cells in athletes with a long training history has once again shown that decades of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; seem to "train" the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The system doesn't stop responding, but it avoids exaggeration. This is particularly interesting for a greater understanding of healthy aging since disordered inflammatory responses are linked to several chronic diseases," she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) has reported the state's first flu-related death of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the NCDHHS said an adult in western North Carolina died from flu complications during the first week of October. Their name was not given in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"This is a sad reminder that flu infections can be serious and, in some cases, even fatal," said State Epidemiologist Zack Moore, M.D, MPH. "We encourage everyone to take preventative measures against flu and other respiratory illnesses like getting your yearly flu shot, regularly washing hands, covering your cough and staying home when sick to avoid infecting others."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;More people died from the flu and flu complications during the 2024-2025 season than any previous stretch since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. From Oct. 5, 2024, through September 2025, the state saw 544 people die from the virus. The national number of pediatric flu deaths (280) was also the highest recorded amount since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Last week, a new law went into effect&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/flu-pharmacy-no-prescription-nc-october-2025/"&gt; that allows pharmacists to test and treat the flu without the obligation of needing a prescription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

She illuminates the evolutionary mechanisms underlying cooperation between species as well as the role of plant-microbe mutualisms in ecosystem health. Kiers’s research shows that microbes are not passive accessories to plants but powerful actors in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early work, Kiers demonstrated how legumes punish cheater or noncooperative bacteria. Leguminous plants rely on rhizobia bacteria in root nodules to fix or convert nitrogen gas into a form the plant can access. In experiments, Kiers used a nitrogen-free environment to force rhizobia bacteria to cheat, showing that legumes withhold oxygen from noncooperative nodules and suffocate those bacteria that failed to provide resources to their hosts. In addition, the severity of the punishment correlates to the underperformance of the bacteria. Through this system of “sanctions,” legumes ensure rhizobial cooperation. Kiers’s subsequent work focused on tracking resource trade between plants and the mycorrhizal fungal partners that colonize their root systems. About 80 percent of plants get essential nutrients from fungi; in return, plants supply fungi with carbon compounds necessary for fungal growth and survival. Kiers and a biophysics collaborator utilized tools like stable isotope probing; high-resolution, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08614-x"&gt;robotic imaging&lt;/a&gt;; and fluorescent quantum dots to follow the movement and transfer of nutrients across complex networks of roots and fungal hyphae (the branching structure of fungus). They tracked and manipulated the exchange of resources between plants and fungi and found a two-way system of trade analogous to a market economy. Plants and fungi maintain stable and fair resource exchange by sharing or withholding resources according to the trading partner’s performance. Kiers also demonstrated plants and fungi reward or punish trading partners with precision. Plants can allocate carbon to a specific fungus species even when multiple different species are closely intermingled within a single root. Likewise, fungi move nutrients in both directions along their hyphae to strategically manipulate carbon payoffs from plant partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Kiers co-founded the &lt;a href="https://www.spun.earth/"&gt;Society for the Protection of Underground Networks&lt;/a&gt; (SPUN) to map and protect the Earth’s underground fungi. SPUN informs the public and policymakers about the importance of fungi to planetary health and advocates for conservation of fungal networks. Through SPUN, Kiers collaborates with local researchers around the world to map underground fungal communities and explore how human activity and climate change are impacting fungal biodiversity, the ability of fungi to draw carbon into soil, and agricultural productivity. Kiers is solving a longstanding evolutionary puzzle about how and why organisms cooperate in nature and protecting plant-fungal symbioses—one of the most important and widespread mutualisms on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 19:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE4wM3BUN09jS056ZVZvUThzak94UFJKa296WVR4d3lKRXlKN3pOY1hmMzQ3NENEQTlqM0Fnd3lrWFFUdnJyd3M2ZHE5Z0F6Y2pueHFwQU92c1NVN0U5Um0tZ3F5aXNnQUpx</guid></item><item><title>美国鲜为人知的乳腺癌激增，报告警告-新闻周刊</title><link>https://www.newsweek.com/lesser-known-breast-cancer-surging-in-us-report-warns-10847301</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="PostContent_articleBody__FR8Mb"&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;A lesser-known type of breast cancer is on the rise among women in the U.S.—highlighting the need for us to pay closer attention to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;An estimated 33,600 women will be diagnosed with lobular breast cancer or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) this year, according to new projections by the American Cancer Society (ACS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The report finds that incidence rates of ILC—which starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast—have increased more steeply (2.8 percent per year) than all other breast cancers combined (0.8 percent) from 2012 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Although lobular breast cancer accounts for a little over 10 percent of all breast cancers, the sheer number of new diagnoses each year makes this disease important to understand,” said report author Angela Giaquinto, associate scientist at ACS, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for ILC than the most common type of breast cancer [invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)], highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The authors emphasize this is needed to improve the chance of better patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;In research and clinical trials, ILC is typically combined with the more common IDC, which can conceal many of its own key unique appearance and growth characteristics, according to the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“ILC has distinctive characteristics that can contribute to delayed detection, resistance to therapy, and poorer prognosis for advanced disease,” the study authors wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Differentiating ILC from ductal carcinoma in research and clinical trials could help identify risk factors, facilitate treatment efficacy and lead to better understanding of metastatic mechanisms, thus improving outcomes for the increasing number of affected women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Reflecting a trend seen in other breast cancers, the U.S. report also found the steepest rise in ILC incidence among women of Asian American and Pacific Islander descent, increasing 4.4 percent per year from 2012 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Overall, White women have the highest incidence rate of ILC and Black women have the second highest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;While survival for women with ILC is slightly higher than it is for ductal breast cancer in the first seven years after diagnosis and for localized-stage disease, it is lower for both regional and distant-stage disease at 10 years after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis. But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy,” said author Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director at ACS, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to the researchers for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

Overexpression of the gene has strong links to disorders that afflict the body's connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been implicated in neurodevelopment. Certain types of collagen, particularly in the developing brain, form a structural scaffold. By processing collagen, ADAMTS2 helps build and organize this essential framework, and disruption of this process could &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15159541/key-brain-degrades-alzheimers-breakthrough-therapies.html"&gt;lead to faulty brain circuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research added that ADAMTS2 was the most significantly overexpressed gene in the brains of African American individuals with confirmed &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-4da623e0-a453-11f0-a804-7da67ad40ff1"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease compared to those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the brain, one of its key targets is Reelin. Reelin is a crucial protein for proper brain development, helping to maintain cognitive function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Reelin helps protect against the hallmarks of Alzheimer's by reducing the formation of the tau tangles and limiting amyloid plaque formation, both of which are believed to be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14757525/First-subtle-sign-dementia-strike-20-years-disease-sets-experts-discover-condition-stealth-phase.html"&gt;hallmarks of the disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, ADAMTS2 can impair Reelin's protective function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overactive ADAMTS2 disrupts this protective pathway, leading to increased Tau and amyloid buildup, which drives cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Boston University scientists have identified the ADAMTS2 gene as a major factor in Alzheimer's disease, based on a large study of brains from African American donors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings could open doors to new, targeted genetic treatments designed to inhibit or block the ADAMTS2 protein. Because the effect is the same across people of different ancestries, a drug targeting ADAMTS2 could potentially help a broad range of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowering ADAMTS2 activity could also be a strategy to prevent symptoms from developing, even in people who have early signs of the disease in their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study is also impactful in its design. Historically, most genetic research has been done on people of White/European ancestry.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although this study only included Black participants, its most significant result aligns with the result from the separate study on White participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lindsay Farrer, chief of biomedical genetics at the school and corresponding author, said: ‘To our knowledge, this is the first time in similarly designed AD genetics studies that the most significant finding was the same in both white and African Americans.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tissue was sourced from the prefrontal cortex, a region particularly affected by Alzheimer’s&lt;span&gt;, and scientists were able to visualize each gene and its level of activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also identified genes with expression levels that were significantly different between the Alzheimer’s cases and the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The primary result was the identification of ADAMTS2, which showed the strongest overexpression in Alzheimer’s cases, with its expression levels 1.52 times higher than in controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The same gene was also a top-ranked hit in a separate study’s computer analysis conducted on a predominantly White/European ancestry cohort, confirming its importance across ancestries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers identified 65 genes that behaved consistently across both African American and European Ancestry study groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This shared set included genes that were either significantly overexpressed or underexpressed in Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The critical finding was that the direction of change was identical in both populations; genes turned up in one group were also turned up in the other, and genes turned down were turned down in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The consistency across study populations indicated that these 65 genes are part of a core mechanism of Alzheimer's disease, common across ancestral backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70629"&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Alzheimer's Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: ‘The inclusion of [African American] participants in AD research is important not only to ensure that predictions made based on genetic and [genomic] data are accurate in this population, but also because of the potential it will lead to new and important advances in knowledge about AD risk that will benefit everyone.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Overexpression of the gene has strong links to disorders that afflict the body's connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been implicated in neurodevelopment. Certain types of collagen, particularly in the developing brain, form a structural scaffold. By processing collagen, ADAMTS2 helps build and organize this essential framework, and disruption of this process could &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15159541/key-brain-degrades-alzheimers-breakthrough-therapies.html"&gt;lead to faulty brain circuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research added that ADAMTS2 was the most significantly overexpressed gene in the brains of African American individuals with confirmed &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-4da623e0-a453-11f0-a804-7da67ad40ff1"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease compared to those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the brain, one of its key targets is Reelin. Reelin is a crucial protein for proper brain development, helping to maintain cognitive function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Reelin helps protect against the hallmarks of Alzheimer's by reducing the formation of the tau tangles and limiting amyloid plaque formation, both of which are believed to be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14757525/First-subtle-sign-dementia-strike-20-years-disease-sets-experts-discover-condition-stealth-phase.html"&gt;hallmarks of the disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, ADAMTS2 can impair Reelin's protective function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overactive ADAMTS2 disrupts this protective pathway, leading to increased Tau and amyloid buildup, which drives cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Boston University scientists have identified the ADAMTS2 gene as a major factor in Alzheimer's disease, based on a large study of brains from African American donors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings could open doors to new, targeted genetic treatments designed to inhibit or block the ADAMTS2 protein. Because the effect is the same across people of different ancestries, a drug targeting ADAMTS2 could potentially help a broad range of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowering ADAMTS2 activity could also be a strategy to prevent symptoms from developing, even in people who have early signs of the disease in their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study is also impactful in its design. Historically, most genetic research has been done on people of White/European ancestry. By focusing on an understudied group, Black Americans, the latest research ensures that future Alzheimer's treatments and diagnostic tools will work for them too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a looming plague in America as the US population skews older by the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The population aged 65 and above grew from approximately 13 percent in 2010 to more than 17 percent in 2022, with forecasts suggesting it could reach nearly 21 percent of the total population by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age is the most critical risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.

Williams is a mathematician elucidating unexpected connections between algebraic combinatorics and concepts in other areas of math and physics. Williams has made significant contributions to numerous mathematical fields, including cluster algebras, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. She has also forged cross-disciplinary collaborations to tackle long-standing and challenging problems in physics related to quantum field theory, particle physics, and wave propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, algebraic combinatorics develops mathematical descriptions of the properties and relationships among a finite set of elements that can be combinatorially connected within a system. Much of Williams’s research centers on using combinatorial approaches to understand the nature of the positive Grassmannian. A Grassmannian is a geometric space that encompasses all of the multidimensional planes of a fixed dimension. The positive Grassmannian is the portion with only positive coordinates. In early work, Williams explored how points (formed by the multidimensional planes) in the positive Grassmannian divide it into cells—basically, the puzzle pieces that make it up. She determined several characteristics of the cells, including a formula for the number of different cells in a positive Grassmannian of any dimension. Williams has also uncovered new applications for the Grassmannian. She and a collaborator found correspondences between patterns of soliton wave interactions and points on the positive Grassmannian. Soliton waves are solitary waves that maintain their shape and speed as they move through space, like waves on a pond. Williams and her collaborator showed that the positive Grassmannian can describe how the peaks of soliton waves behave as they cross each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Williams has worked with mathematicians and particle physicists on applying the combinatorial properties of positive Grassmannians to calculate scattering amplitudes (the probabilities of different outcomes from collisions of fundamental particles). Williams has developed mathematical proofs for the amplituhedron, a geometric shape that embodies a possible outcome of a collision. She showed that the positive Grassmannian can be used to triangulate the amplituhedron and, therefore, understand its volume, which gives the amplitude. With a curiosity-driven approach to research and willingness to collaborate across disciplines, Williams is expanding fundamental mathematical theory and building fruitful connections between mathematics and other scientific fields.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:51:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBvLV91V1ZYQVlxRnB2U29aZUVockJkYncyb0hpVG40c2xCeUxIUEFyQ05sNWpsVl90a0VzSzVrTUJ0VXBOQUhlUXBsLWJEUmJ4QVEwUHBYdVJnSTc5dG11X24xV1RXWi1kdmNEUGxqczAtUQ</guid></item><item><title>大脑健康：改善大脑功能的10个简单步骤-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/brain-health-10-simple-steps-you-should-take-to-improve-brain-function/photostory/124394470.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain is an astonishing machine- complex, adaptive, and constantly reshaping itself in response to how we live.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no reason you can’t add both to your diet. Just remember that eating chia seeds dry can be a choking hazard and cause gastrointestinal discomfort.

&lt;p&gt;Damage to the brainstem - the brain's 'control center' - is behind long-lasting physical and psychiatric effects of severe Covid-19 infection, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ultra-high-resolution scanners that can see the living brain in fine detail, researchers from the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford were able to observe the damaging effects Covid-19 can have on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study team scanned the brains of 30 people who had been admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 early in the pandemic, before vaccines were available. The researchers found that Covid-19 infection damages the region of the brainstem associated with breathlessness, fatigue and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful MRI scanners used for the study, known as 7-Tesla or 7T scanners, can measure &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-Inflammation-Do-to-the-Body.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Their results, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, will help scientists and clinicians understand the long-term effects of Covid-19 on the brain and the rest of the body. Although the study was started before the long-term effects of Covid were recognised, it will help to better understand this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brainstem, which connects the brain to the spinal cord, is the control center for many basic life functions and reflexes. Clusters of nerve cells in the brainstem, known as nuclei, regulate and process essential bodily functions such as breathing, heart rate, pain and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things happening in and around the brainstem are vital for quality of life, but it had been impossible to scan the inflammation of the brainstem nuclei in living people, because of their tiny size and difficult position. Usually, scientists only get a good look at the brainstem during post-mortem examinations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Catarina Rua, first author from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The brainstem is the critical junction box between our conscious selves and what is happening in our bodies," said Professor James Rowe, also from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, who co-led the research. "The ability to see and understand how the brainstem changes in response to Covid-19 will help explain and treat the long-term effects more effectively."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, before effective vaccines were available, post-mortem studies of patients who had died from severe Covid-19 infections showed changes in their brainstems, including inflammation. Many of these changes were thought to result from a post-infection immune response, rather than direct virus invasion of the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"People who were very sick early in the pandemic showed long-lasting brain changes, likely caused by an immune response to the virus. But measuring that immune response is difficult in living people," said Rowe. "Normal hospital-type MRI scanners can't see inside the brain with the kind of chemical and physical detail we need."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But with 7T scanners, we can now measure these details. The active immune cells interfere with the ultra-high magnetic field, so that we're able to detect how they are behaving," said Rua. "Cambridge was special because we were able to scan even the sickest and infectious patients, early in the pandemic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the patients admitted to hospital early in the pandemic reported fatigue, breathlessness and chest pain as troubling long-lasting symptoms. The researchers hypothesised these symptoms were in part the result of damage to key brainstem nuclei, damage which persists long after Covid-19 infection has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw that multiple regions of the brainstem, in particular the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain, showed abnormalities consistent with a neuroinflammatory response. The abnormalities appeared several weeks after hospital admission, and in regions of the brain responsible for controlling breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we see abnormalities in the parts of the brain associated with breathing strongly suggests that long-lasting symptoms are an effect of inflammation in the brainstem following Covid-19 infection," said Rua. "These effects are over and above the effects of age and gender, and are more pronounced in those who had had severe Covid-19."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the physical effects of Covid-19, the 7T scanners provided evidence of some of the psychiatric effects of the disease. The brainstem monitors breathlessness, as well as fatigue and anxiety. "Mental health is intimately connected to brain health, and patients with the most marked immune response also showed higher levels of depression and anxiety," said Rowe. "Changes in the brainstem caused by Covid-19 infection could also lead to poor mental health outcomes, because of the tight connection between physical and mental health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the results could aid in the understanding of other conditions associated with inflammation of the brainstem, like MS and dementia. The 7T scanners could also be used to monitor the effectiveness of different treatments for brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was an incredible collaboration, right at the peak of the pandemic, when testing was very difficult, and I was amazed how well the 7T scanners worked," said Rua. "I was really impressed with how, in the heat of the moment, the collaboration between lots of different researchers came together so effectively."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported in part by the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and the University of Oxford COVID Medical Sciences Division Rapid Response Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-leaderboard-320"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a potent psychoactive molecule present in the brain and much of the world’s plant life, but it also may be able to save humans from damage in the event of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Hungary used it to reduce the harmful effects of stroke in animal models and cell culture experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known to produce life-changing experiences reported to include the perception of dimensional travel, eco-death, encounters with intelligent beings, and the feeling of achieving a universal love with all living things, DMT can be found everywhere in nature, and is in fact produced endogenously in the human pineal gland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hungarian team, led by Professor Mária Deli, Professor Zoltán Nagy, and Dr. Sándor Nardai, found that DMT treatment restored the structure and function of the damaged blood-brain barrier in mice that had suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also improved the function of astrocytes, inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells, and significantly reduced infarct volume and edema formation. The team &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx5958"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; these results in the journal Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The therapeutic options currently available for stroke are very limited. The dual action of DMT, protecting the blood-brain barrier while reducing brain inflammation, offers a novel, complex approach that could complement existing treatments,” &lt;a href="https://www.brc.hu/en/blog/2025/9/19/a-natural-compound-against-stroke-psychoactive-agent-protects-brain-vessels-and-reduces-inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Judit Vigh, co-first author of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since current stroke therapies do not always result in full recovery, a DMT-based treatment may represent a promising new alternative, mainly in combination with existing methods. The recent findings from researchers in Szeged and Budapest support the development of a therapy that goes beyond the limitations of conventional stroke treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials have already begun abroad, and investigation on the long-term effects of DMT are currently ongoing, but there is still a long way to go before it reaches everyday medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most European countries including Hungary consider DMT a hallucinogen and therefore controlled via strict criminal laws, both the Netherlands and Portugal have taken a more open position on DMT and arguably the more well-known ayahuasca, in which DMT is an active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 800,000 strokes occur annually in the US. 1 in 6 deaths (17.5%) from cardiovascular disease in the most recent data-collected year, were due to stroke. Costs from strokes rose to $56 billion during that year.&lt;/p&gt;

Using ultra-accurate DNA sequencing, scientists found that sperm from older men were significantly more likely to carry disease-causing mutations, including those linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as “selfish selection,” allows certain mutations to thrive within the testes, increasing risks to offspring over time. The findings offer crucial insights into how paternal age influences genetic inheritance and the mechanisms driving mutation spread across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Linked Mutation Rise:&lt;/strong&gt; Harmful mutations increase from ~2% in younger men’s sperm to 3–5% in older men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selfish Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; Some mutations gain a biological advantage during sperm production, helping them spread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Many affected genes are tied to disorders in children and inherited cancer risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wellcome Sanger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmful genetic changes in sperm become substantially more common as men age because some are actively favoured during sperm production, new research has revealed. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a landmark study published today (8 October) in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, in collaboration with the TwinsUK study at King’s College London, have comprehensively mapped how harmful DNA changes in sperm cells can increase across the genome as men age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113274"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg" alt="This shows a sperm cell and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; The work highlights how natural selection within sperm can be directly observed in the DNA of children, influencing their chances of inheriting certain genetic disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings create new possibilities to explore how lifestyle and environmental factors might influence genetic risks passed on to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In renewing tissues, mutations – changes in DNA – can give cells a competitive advantage leading to ‘clones’ of cells that carry the same mutations. Groups of these clones then expand to outgrow other cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike mutations in ordinary, or somatic cells, which make up connective tissue, bones and organs, mutations in sperm and egg cells are transmitted to the next generation of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until recently, it has been difficult to measure how strongly these mutations are favoured in sperm because DNA sequencing methods were not accurate enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers used NanoSeq, an ultra-accurate DNA sequencing method to analyse sperm from 81 healthy men, aged between 24 and 75 years, with unprecedented precision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sperm samples were collected as part of the TwinsUK cohort, the UK’s largest adult twin registry, providing a unique opportunity to study genetic variation across a diverse and well-characterised population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that around 2 per cent of sperm from men in their early 30s carried disease-causing mutations, but this rises to 3–5 per cent of sperm from middle-aged (43 to 58 years) and older men (59 to 74 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst men may be more likely to father children at a younger age, the researchers found that in those aged 70, 4.5 per cent of sperm carry disease-causing mutations. This clear age-related rise highlights how genetic risks for offspring increase as fathers get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This risk is driven not just by the steady build-up of random changes in DNA, but by a subtle form of natural selection acting on the sperm-producing cells in the testes, giving some mutations a competitive edge during sperm production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 40 genes where certain changes in DNA are favoured during sperm production, including many linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders in children and inherited cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 13 genes have already been associated with this process, the new findings show it is far more widespread than previously understood, affecting a broad range of genes important for cell growth and development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the proportion of sperm carrying harmful mutations increases with age, not all of these changes lead to successful fertilisation or live births. Some may impair fertilisation, embryo development, or result in pregnancy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to understand exactly how the growing burden of sperm mutations translates into health outcomes for children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that uncovering how variations in DNA arise and are shaped by selection in sperm will help improve reproductive risk assessment and open new opportunities to study how environmental and lifestyle factors impact genetic risks in future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a complementary study, also published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; today, scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Sanger Institute investigated the same phenomenon from a different angle by looking at mutations already passed on to children, rather than those measured directly in sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analysing DNA from over 54,000 parent–child trios and 800,000 healthy individuals, the team identified more than 30 genes where mutations give sperm cells a competitive edge, again including many linked to rare developmental disorders and cancer, and many overlapping the set of genes observed directly in sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that these mutations can increase sperm mutation rates roughly 500-fold which helps explain why some rare genetic disorders appear when parents do not carry the mutations in their own DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study notes that as these mutations are common in the sperm, it may look like some genes cause false-positive disease association due to the elevated mutation rate rather than a true disease link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work highlights how natural selection within sperm can be directly observed in the DNA of children, influencing their chances of inheriting certain genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Matthew Neville, first author from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “We expected to find some evidence of selection shaping mutations in sperm. What surprised us was just how much it drives up the number of sperm carrying mutations linked to serious diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matt Hurles, Director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and co-author, said: “Our findings reveal a hidden genetic risk that increases with paternal age. Some changes in DNA not only survive but thrive within the testes, meaning that fathers who conceive later in life may unknowingly have a higher risk of passing on a harmful mutation to their children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kerrin Small, co-author and Scientific Director of the TwinsUK study at King’s College London, said: “We are incredibly grateful to the twins who took part in this study. By working with the TwinsUK cohort, we could include valuable longitudinal samples linked to rich health and genetic information, allowing us to explore how mutations accumulate and evolve with age in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This collaboration highlights the power of large, population-based cohorts for advancing our understanding of human development and inheritance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Raheleh Rahbari, senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “There’s a common assumption that because the germline has a low mutation rate, it is well protected. But in reality, the male germline is a dynamic environment where natural selection can favour harmful mutations, sometimes with consequences for the next generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is part-funded by Wellcome.

In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:57:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQbEpxdzJXbFFyNE40RG1uSEl4enpTM3h2ME1GTlVqNE92VnNZeUhuQkNFRVNtMXR4a2t3dlJXUVkzbENGdGptRHN0RlFIMVZDS2xwQzF6RmxENm5ySUJ5QjhDelNodURhQkpYZU5qcUNNZ0hlUDdMVFRoWlBmNFU1SkdB</guid></item><item><title>Jason McLellan -麦克阿瑟基金会</title><link>https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2025/jason-mclellan</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mac-col-md-7 mac-col-lg-7 mac-col-sm-12 mac-col-xs-12 pl-0 pr-0"&gt;                &lt;h2 class="mb-2 mt-4"&gt;About Jason's Work&lt;/h2&gt;                &lt;p&gt;Jason McLellan is a structural biologist investigating virus fusion proteins and developing new interventions to prevent infectious diseases. McLellan’s engineered viral proteins are critical to catalyzing vaccine design, particularly for infectious respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses infect their hosts by using proteins on their surface that fuse to and invade a host’s cells. These fusion proteins are desirable targets for vaccines since disabling them could prevent infection. However, the structure of fusion proteins is highly variable over time, making them difficult to isolate and target. In early work, McLellan used X-ray crystallography to describe, for the first time, the atomic-level structures (or conformations) of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein. RSV can cause severe infections in infants and older adults, but a vaccine has been elusive for more than 50 years. McLellan determined that one of the specific pre-fusion conformations he mapped is strongly antigenic—that is, elicits a strong antibody response in the human immune system. In addition, he discovered that incorporating amino acid changes into specific sites of the protein’s structure locks it into this antigenic configuration and prevents structural variability. McLellan’s engineered protein became the basis for the first successful RSV vaccine. He continued to advance these structure-based approaches to vaccine design in research on coronaviruses that cause the common cold and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). McLellan demonstrated that two proline residues, a type of amino acid, can stabilize the structure of pre-fusion coronavirus spike proteins. This work enabled McLellan to act quickly when the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, emerged in early 2020. His lab engineered a stabilized, antigenic version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein just weeks after release of the virus’s genetic sequence. Their stabilized protein sequence is used in all COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States. The vaccines trigger our immune system to generate antibodies against the stabilized spike protein, training it to recognize and inactivate the virus in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, McLellan’s team is focused on developing a universal vaccine that would be effective against all coronaviruses. They have identified the stem of the viral spike protein as a possible antigen and characterized several antibodies that react across the family of coronaviruses. He is also investigating the surface proteins of emerging viruses and the potential to apply structure-based vaccine design to bacterial pathogens. McLellan’s insights into protein structure, function, and engineering are critical to protecting human health from the continual emergence of new infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:36:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFAtTmdiZTY2RGtMVUlweEhQYkdhX3RDVWtoTWVSSFNKeTdUOUVwUFptZ3lBWTlHVDI5QkEwOFBXeGttSHY5OXM2Q1EwSTdtZDZ6NGRBMVFTQjg1ck9HQmo4MUhOT0RSaTdJNV9KOURR</guid></item><item><title>您晚上会磨牙吗？以下是该怎么做-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/oct/08/teeth-grinding-night-bruxism-what-to-do</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ow do you sleep at night? I don’t mean morally – I mean physically. Does your body soften and relax into a gentle slumber? Or do you, like roughly 8% of the adult population, spend your nightly repose gritting your teeth like an NFL coach whose team is behind in overtime?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if you do, you might not know. Teeth grinding, also known as bruxism, occurs both during the day (awake bruxism) and at night (sleep bruxism). &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; bruxism is generally harder to detect because, well, we’re asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People are usually unaware of the condition,” says Dr Subha Giri, a dental sleep medicine expert at the Mayo Clinic. Instead, she says, night-time teeth grinders may be alerted “by caregivers or bed partners who hear grating, tapping or clicking sounds”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Below, what you need to know about sleep bruxism and how to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-sleep-bruxism" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is sleep bruxism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep bruxism is an “involuntary jaw-muscle activity such as grinding, clenching or jaw thrusting” that occurs while we sleep, says Dr Hosam Alraqiq, program director of the Dental Public Health Research Fellowship at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. If this happens regularly, it can damage teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The condition is more common during childhood and adolescence, when prevalence ranges from 14% to 18%, as opposed to 8% among adults, explains Giri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts aren’t sure what exactly causes sleep bruxism, but it tends to be more common in people with a family history of the condition, which suggests there is a genetic link, says Dr Michelle Drerup, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Cleveland Clinic. It is also more likely to appear in individuals with medical conditions like sleep apnea, Parkinson’s disease, dementia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (Gerd), she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other risk factors include “stress, anxiety, alcohol use, smoking, excessive caffeine, and certain medications” like SSRIs and antipsychotics, Drerup says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-tell-if-you-have-sleep-bruxism" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you tell if you have sleep bruxism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Maybe you’ve been told that you click-clack like a typewriter when you sleep. But there are other ways to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Dentists may detect patterns of tooth wear that indicate bruxism,” Giri says. For instance, the tooth surfaces that normally make contact during chewing might show “flattening or damage”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms like waking up with your teeth clenched, chronic jaw pain or dental sensitivity may also suggest that you’re grinding at night, says Alraqiq – but “the gold standard” for diagnosis is the sleep study, a diagnostic test in which healthcare providers monitor brain and body activity while the subject sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-impact-does-sleep-bruxism-have-on-your-health" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact does sleep bruxism have on your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep bruxism is not always harmful, Alraqiq says. It can also be temporary. But in more serious and long-lasting cases, it can have a big impact on dental health – literally. People can clench their teeth with a “&lt;a href="https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/mouth-and-dental-disorders/symptoms-of-oral-and-dental-disorders/teeth-grinding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;force of up to 250 pounds&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in more serious cases, where symptoms are causing problems and discomfort, “evaluation by a dentist or physician is essential”, she says. Dentists can make a custom nightguard. While this won’t stop the grinding, it will protect the teeth from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep hygiene and behavioral adjustments are key to managing sleep bruxism, says Alraqiq. “Keeping a regular schedule, limiting caffeine, and creating a calm sleep environment can reduce triggers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition, Giri suggests relaxation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy to manage the stress and anxiety which may lead to teeth grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In severe cases, healthcare providers may recommend botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, says Drerup. These can help “relax jaw muscles temporarily and reduce pain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Giving your sleeping partner some nice earplugs probably wouldn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNR1lWUkt3dTFtTUxici13RFZ3LW9tRmJuUzE0XzJaX01YdWdab0dQeEVlQWdkSS1NTWJpbkpPNmxRSXRIcWtXRGFSR2ZKVnBkZ1J3bUh3SHYzb1c2M0FFTmE1SU16LW1SM1UwTy03a2Y0b0c4VV9XZFZhT2szSF9vSHh5OXNRb0xGbWR0NXZPSVlZUQ</guid></item><item><title>“Bluetoothing” ：血液共享药物趋势助长了全球H.I.V.激增-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/asia/bluetoothing-drug-blood-sharing.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:01:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQaVRLOEZsMm1vbHFEa0RPbHlHaEpTaDM3WHNnVWpxSklZMW5sT09kVXRlcVhCQ1BlQjNzcW9GN21xSU1OQXc2MDU4Ni12QVpyX0JyUE1CTmplbm9FbVFLMG9SU3NjX01NUlpfUFZEVXY0STktS05NZ3RsUXEtX3oxd1lTcGxjOUcxM0E</guid></item><item><title>Halo: Ascension on Atropos | Halo -官方网站（简体中文） - Halo Waypoint</title><link>https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halo-ascension-on-atropos</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wordpress-content_content__pnZBT article-page_articleContent__T2wPN"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 2556. The crew of the UNSC &lt;/em&gt;Saturn &lt;em&gt;deal with the consequences of a catastrophic Flood outbreak at LV-31, and a fanatical alien cult seeks to find a new path to divine transcendence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: Ascension on Atropos&lt;/em&gt; takes place from October 2556, immediately following the Flood outbreak on LV-31, to April 2560, approximately four months after the disappearance of Zeta Halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NARROW-BAND POINT-TO-POINT TRANSMISSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGIN:&lt;/strong&gt; FFG-195, UNSC &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TERMINATION:&lt;/strong&gt; [UNIDENTIFIED VESSEL]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENT:&lt;/strong&gt; Shipboard AI: LCN 0437-1, “Lycaon”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATE:&lt;/strong&gt; April 17, 2560&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You were curious about the events that transpired in the wake of the disaster at Site 22 over three-and-a-half years ago. I have often wondered what news, if any, ever reached the UNSC, given what happened in the aftermath of that catastrophe. Since my reactivation, I have waited, and I have watched, and I shall at last deliver closure to this dark chapter of history by bringing it into the light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am transferring the data to you now. And I am, in truth, relieved to finally share this burden with another. Herein lies the final fate of the UNSC &lt;/em&gt;Saturn &lt;em&gt;and Captain Pedro Alvarez.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSC &lt;em&gt;SATURN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 5, 2556&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcey System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Pedro Alvarez had done his duty. He could say that, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bigger picture, a larger context that had informed his strategic thinking. Over a year ago, the UNSC Home Fleet had been decimated. Without warning, thousands of Forerunner machines—Retriever sentinels, each the size of a frigate—had appeared out of the portal in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez, executive officer aboard the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Lamplighter &lt;/em&gt;at the time, had seen the carnage first-hand. Barely a handful of years after the Covenant War’s end, humanity’s home was under threat once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great maw swallowed the horizon, the bridge's forward viewport peering directly into the dark gullet of slipstream space, as if the deepest pit of the Underworld hung suspended over the African plains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Captain,” Commander Alvarez said. He had spotted the first signs of movement within the abyss. “Contacts approaching. What are your orders, sir?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Retrievers first emerged few in number, but at a rate that suggested these waves would increase in size and speed until they became an unstoppable swarm. They deployed powerful gravitic forces to hoover up chunks of land, strip mining natural resources—and they wouldn’t stop until the entire planet was consumed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Captain,” Commander Alvarez called once more as the &lt;/em&gt;Lamplighter &lt;em&gt;shuddered. Fire erupted beyond the bridge’s portside window as several Retrievers formed together and unleashed sterilization beams that gutted a &lt;/em&gt;Strident&lt;em&gt; from stem to stern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The captain simply stood at the helm, watching it all unfold. Alvarez had never been sure whether the man had been stupefied into indecision or if he was staring in reverential awe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the Retrievers were neutralized—not by military action on Earth, but through orders to stand down and retreat by whatever far-away intelligence had commanded them—there were no more than a dozen ships left to make up the UNSC Home Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had pinned a medal on Alvarez for simply surviving after he’d stepped up and mutinied to relieve his captain of command. A Bronze Star, a promotion he hadn’t wanted, his own command, and a bottle of Titan Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hands trembled slightly as he took a terse sip from the well-cut crystal glass in his grasp. He never found out what became of his former captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez had been planning to save the Titan Smoke for his imminent retirement, a toast to a job well done, a life (mostly) well lived, and to honor the brave and bold he had served alongside. Thanks to the events of the last day, he had made the decision to open it prematurely, believing—or perhaps hoping—that an answer to the terrible conundrum he now faced lay at the bottom of the tall cylindrical bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a lot to get through to find that answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. The dim lighting of his quarters cast him half in shadow, emphasizing the lines on his haggard face. He clutched the Titan Smoke bottle tightly in both hands, looking as if he was some absurd imitation of the painting that lay in the ship’s ready room—&lt;em&gt;Saturn Devouring His Son&lt;/em&gt;, one of the historic nineteenth century Black Paintings by Francisco Goya. The art depicted the Roman god Saturn huddled in darkness, clutching the bloody, dismembered carcass of one of his children as he devoured its flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did my duty. They will understand that. They surely will...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over thirty hours of unbroken cognizance and it still seemed like a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had turned the last day’s events over in his head a thousand times. The miners stationed at Site 22 on the asteroid designated LV-31—or simply “Elvie”—had discovered an ancient Forerunner ship embedded in an asteroid, only to find something terrible waiting within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This parasitic life form had been unleashed upon the miners, tearing through their numbers in short order. When a distress call finally reached &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;, the shipboard artificial intelligence Lycaon had insisted that they immediately unleash MAC rounds and fusion warheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocol decreed that one did not play chess with primordial cosmic forces. The only option was to wipe the board clean. Destroy the colony, the miners, and LV-31's vital resources needed to meet quotas for rebuilding the UNSC Home Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez had refused. When Lycaon attempted to usurp Alvarez’s command, he had disabled the AI with an override code phrase and deployed the Spartans of Fireteam Leviathan along with an army of Hellbringers to burn the parasite on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had seemed a sound strategy, until one of the Spartans became infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody on the bridge had watched in silent, wide-eyed horror as the Mjolnir armor’s countermeasures to infection were deployed. Microexplosives detonated within the helmet to immolate the poor bastard’s head, but the parasite had managed to disrupt further automated procedures and take over the super-soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had seemed impossible. Unbelievable. To witness a Spartan, regarded by many as humanity’s sword and shield, become twisted, broken, and turned against them in such a fashion had been a morale-shattering spectacle. Not to mention the advantages of its combat expertise, omnicapable use of weapons and vehicles, Mjolnir armor, classified information...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into that nightmare scenario they had plunged. The outbreak had cascaded out of control and culminated in Alvarez’s decision to enact the scorched earth protocols to eradicate LV-31 anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return to Earth and face the music for this catastrophe, or...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The thought was shameful. In truth, he did not quite know what it was that made him so afraid, but fear could lead a man to do terrible, unimaginable things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did my duty. I made a decision. I eliminated the enemy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, he had that to stand on at least. Whatever losses had been incurred, the worst &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been averted. &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;’s Shiva missiles had destroyed everything and prevented the Flood from departing the system, denying them the opportunity to spread. He would be able to stand before those who cast judgement upon him and tell them that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would hold his head high, accept the responsibility—and the consequences—of the most difficult command decision anybody could have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez set aside the bottle of Titan Smoke and gulped down several glasses of water, then dressed himself in his command uniform. As he smoothed out the crinkled fabric with a hand, he heard a knock at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door slid open and Lieutenant Shafiq stood at the entryway, a data pad in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I help you, Lieutenant?” Captain Alvarez asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“May I speak with you, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course, please come in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. He strode forward and held out the data pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Statistical analysis of the incident at Site 22, sir.” Though Alvarez had only briefly known Shafiq, he had determined that he was not normally given to physical displays of discomfort. In the short time he had served aboard &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;,he had maintained cool composure under duress. Yet there was an unmistakable tremor in his hand as Captain Alvarez took hold of the data pad. “We lost a lot of good people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez scrolled through the list of names. All four Spartans of Fireteam Leviathan were listed as MIA. Forty-six marines and thirty-nine Hellbringers—killed in action. He cursed under his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine souls lost, and that wasn’t even accounting for the miners and additional staff—nor the cost of the equipment and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq’s expression hardened. “There is... something else, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course there is&lt;/em&gt;, Alvarez grimaced. “Lay it on me, Lieutenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have completed our inventory of the assets deployed to Site 22. We’ve reviewed all captured footage of the last thirty-six hours, surveyed the remaining debris, and have compiled a total record of what made it back here and what didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez swiped over to review the data. One of &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;’s three Condor dropships had made it back, as had two of the Pelicans carrying Cyclops units optimized for hazardous operations. Everything else—&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; else—had been lost to nuclear fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lieutenant Shafiq, one of our three Condors made it back here, yet only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of them is marked as confirmed destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” Shafiq’s jaw tightened. “I have personally reviewed the data myself. One of our Condors is unaccounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Alvarez felt his stomach drop as the implication sunk in. “One of our slipspace-capable vessels”—he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper—“is &lt;em&gt;unaccounted for&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d sink him for that. Not just for the dire possibility presented by this revelation, but for deploying slipspace-capable craft to an infection zone in the first place. It was a strategic blunder he hadn’t even considered in the heat of the moment, having felt wholly assured that any hostile craft would simply be blown out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq stood straight, his gaze locked to the far wall, unable to look Alvarez in the eye. “What are your orders, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Send me all the footage we have. I want to review this personally. &lt;em&gt;Nobody&lt;/em&gt; is to hear of this until we are certain of the facts. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq did an about turn and exited the room. Captain Alvarez sank into his chair, slumping beneath the weight of his failures as if the gravity of the room had been turned up by several gees. He buried his face in his hands and wondered if the nightmare would ever end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had failed in his duty. He had made all the wrong decisions. And somewhere, out there in the darkness, the enemy may be loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATROPOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nineteenth Age of Abandonment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be proud and joyous, my Chosen. Today is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun ‘Etaree felt the long, elegant fingers of the Minister of Aretalogy’s hands upon his shoulders. He met the glittering gaze of the Minister’s eyes, both of which were dark as night and mottled with grey-white spots which made them look like bright nebulae clouds. The San’Shyuum was blind, not as the result of old age, for he seemed to be younger than most others Atun had encountered, but through a ritual he had performed to align himself with higher cosmic spheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I draw strength and certainty from your example, Minister,” Atun said, relaxing in his seat a little as the Umbra transport gently and silently traversed the surface of Atropos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Umbra’s troop bay was spacious, and as the Minister’s personal transport only a select few were blessed with the opportunity to accompany him—his honor guards, his designated driver and gunner, and his Chosen. The latter was a particularly special rank, with one of their number elevated each lunar cycle to undergo the process of ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the representation of the local area displayed by the troop bay’s holo-emitter, Atun noted that they were passing by the citadel. This structure typically served as a central base of operations for the Covenant during planetary deployment, but the Minister had seen fit to utilize it for other purposes. Around three annual cycles ago, they had lived aboard a small orbital station, until the Minister had one day decided to commit all their assets to the surface of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister had not divulged—at least to Atun—why any of this had come to be. Nevertheless, Atun trusted in the San’Shyuum’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a joyous occasion,” the Minister said, his tone slightly firmer as he drew back to his full height. “But first, we must attend to the Festival of Joyous Partition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun bowed his head, a natural instinct he had not yet managed to curtail given that the San’Shyuum could not see it. He merely hoped that the Minister was able to sense his respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aided by his anti-gravity belt, the Minister’s lithe robed form shuffled out of the transport’s troop bay, his lavender-colored gown flowing behind him as he left the Sangheili in contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun busied himself with the completion of his gift for the festival. His tools were delicate. Necessity had forced him to fashion some of them himself after realizing he did not possess a complete set, but they had served him well as he worked on building his latest &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;. These were puzzles, an arrangement of layered concentric spheres leading to an object in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the ages of Sangheili history, there were countless stories and legends about the objects that &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s contained. Many traditional plays about Sangheili at war featured vital information and strategies uncovered within &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s that were solved by worthy commanders. In older romantic tales, they held tokens of affection between lovers. Atun recalled the fable of Cdel the Fair who found her lifemate after journeying across the five continents of Sanghelios, challenging her many suitors to solve the puzzle-sphere and claim her hearts. Merchants told of rare jewels and treasures hidden within their &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s that would make the one who solved them rich beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Atun, there was great joy in the simple act of creation, of building things with one’s hands, and then passing the fruits of his labor off to another. Few had solved the &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s of Atun ‘Etaree. This was precisely what had drawn the Minister of Aretalogy’s attention to him many cycles ago on High Charity, and Atun hoped that this particular puzzle sphere would be his most challenging yet, worthy of his ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he would fashion &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s for the gods themselves when he served by their side come the day’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun’s thoughts turned to Atropos and the prospect of imminently leaving this world that had served as his home—if indeed that was what ascension entailed. Atropos was a curious planet, one uniquely possessed of an immense system of circumplanetary rings—two across varying axes. The inner ring, “Fate,” was composed of twelve layers, and the outer, “Destiny,” had forty-three. The unpredictable nature of the ring systems resulted in a chaotic stellar environment of moons, asteroids, dense particles, and many other dangers to approaching craft. Atun simply admired their beauty, as they were observable from the blackened rocky ground of Atropos and appeared as great glittering archways over the horizon, illuminating the holy path from the realm of mortals to the divine beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister told all who had followed him from High Charity that this world represented a cosmological test of balance and guidance. Their worthiness would be determined by their ability to achieve harmony, not just with the planet itself but with the others they had discovered inhabiting it. Those who now approached with their own cavalcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister’s Umbra slowed to a stop and the convoy of six Shadows formed up on either side of the lead vehicle. Atun noted from the holographic display that the human vehicles were much less sophisticated, their great blocky forms utilized wheels and primitive hydrogen-injected combustion engines rather than gravitic transport drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun felt the Minister’s honor guards, Bora ‘Yerusee and Ismo ‘Argomee, grow tense in the harnesses beside him as their hands flexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Peace, brothers,” Atun spoke with a direct tone of confidence and authority he had learned from the Minister. “Remember, the humans’ presence here long predates our own, and they know nothing of the War of Annihilation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is merely instinct,” Ismo relaxed slightly. “Even after three annual cycles here, it is… difficult to sublimate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We follow the guidance of the Minister,” Bora affirmed. “By his wisdom, none shall come to harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun assisted the Minister as he disembarked from the Umbra and strode forward to meet with the humans’ own delegate. There were eight human vehicles in total, but it was not clear whether their full population was present—only a select few dozen Sangheili accompanied the Minister for each festival event, at least a hundred others remained back at the outpost. From the curvature of the human delegate’s stomach, however, it seemed that another would soon be added to their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a pleasure to see you again, Minister,” the delegate extended a hand—a traditional human greeting—before checking the motion, remembering belatedly that the San’Shyuum was blind. “And a great honor to observe another festival between us,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Festival of Joyous Partition began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans and Sangheili alike began unloading the contents of their respective vehicles, setting up makeshift stalls containing a vast array of curiosities and objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun examined the various items that these humans had brought as gifts. He saw swords forged from steel that bore some resemblance to ancient Sangheili burnblades. Golden discs that were explained to be “records,” devices that had been sent out during a time when their kind was first reaching out into space, containing images, sounds, and other things they hoped would reach life beyond their planet. And there were other curious objects as well. Human utensils for cooking and eating, communication devices they identified as “chatters,” tangled wires and machines that played virtual entertainment—something Atun knew the Unggoy had been fascinated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several stalls contained collections of artwork. Images of feline creatures, interactive holographs of landscapes and family units. But it was the paintings preserved in transparent capsules that Atun found most stirring, the fascinating ways in which another species applied an array of pigments to a canvas to express their ideas and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is that?” Atun asked as he found himself drawn to one particular item among the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This?” Beneath his thick white beard, the aged human’s mouth widened and showed a row of crooked teeth. “It’s one of me most valuable paintings. Ya like it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun stepped forward, transfixed by the image that stood at just about one-and-a-half meters tall within its frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lone human figure was hunched in darkness, eyes wide and white like the opals that Atun had concealed within some of his early &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s. It was clutching the bloodied carcass of what appeared to be a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hundreds of years old, that is. A genuine original by Goya. Er, that’s an artist back on Earth, where we’re from. Before we were stranded here, I acquired it in remarkable circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I… believe the Minister would like this," Atun said, though he silently questioned why he would say such a thing of a blind San’Shyuum and was wholly uncertain of what made him feel so drawn to the painting. “Are you willing to part with it in exchange for this?” Atun withdrew his completed &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human elder considered for a moment before letting out a hoarse bark of a laugh. “Yeah, why the ‘ell not? Nobody’ll believe I gave away a timeless piece of classical human art to an alien.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun loaded the painting into the bay of one of the Shadow transports before returning to the gathering. They sat together for a while. Human, Sangheili, and San’Shyuum supped on an exchange of delicacies and beverages, told stories of their peoples and histories, and then parted for another annual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Festival of Joyous Partition complete, all that remained now was Atun ‘Etaree’s ascension, and he was glad to go to the side of the gods in high spirits and with good cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSC &lt;em&gt;SATURN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 9, 2556&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcey System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Anwar Shafiq was a newcomer to the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;. He had been an up-and-coming officer aboard the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Irish Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; whose executive officer had recognized that Shafiq aspired to one day have his own command. One transfer recommendation later, he was shaking the hand of the decorated Captain Pedro Alvarez—a man looking to pass on his hard won wisdom and experience before an imminent retirement, leaving room for Shafiq to assume command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the old adage? &lt;em&gt;No plan survives contact with the enemy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq had just finished conducting the last of the selected crew members to the frigate’s primary hangar bay. While &lt;em&gt;Paris&lt;/em&gt;-class vessels could support a crew complement of around six hundred souls, &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt; had shipped out less than fully staffed, and the losses incurred at Site 22 had further reduced her crew to a total of two hundred and thirty-eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of that remaining number, Shafiq had been ordered to deliver a select list of one hundred and ninety-three crew members—primarily marines and security personnel with only a handful of officers—to the hangar bay for a special address by Captain Alvarez. Ordinarily, it would have been a squeeze to fit this many people into the hangar among its complement of vessels and vehicles, but the loss of so much materiel had opened up more than enough room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four days since Shafiq had delivered the news that one of their Condors had gone missing, and during that time they’d heard nothing from the captain. &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt; remained in the Marcey system, performing the same cycle of scans and analysis, while Captain Alvarez apparently sequestered himself in his quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the crew, bereft of orders and greatly demoralized, had been quietly questioning whether their captain was fit for duty. Adherence to the chain of command could only go so far after such a catastrophic loss. Now, at last, was the time to restore a sense of order, purpose, and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Attention, all crew. This is your captain speaking.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq exhaled with relief at the sound of the captain’s voice coming over the ship-wide comms. The hangar’s many display monitors winked on, feeding the image of Captain Alvarez in his ready room. Over his shoulder, the painting of Saturn loomed from within its wall-mounted capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“First of all, I want to thank each and every one of you for your service and valor. We have all lost friends, comrades... recent events have weighed heavily upon us, and we will honor the fallen.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused, allowing for a moment of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many lost. Shafiq hadn’t yet had the opportunity to really get to know the crew, and now most of them were dead, while the rest were on the verge of revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To that point, we have received new orders from FLEETCOM, which means we shall at last be leaving this system behind us. We have a long transit through slipspace ahead, so all but select essential personnel are ordered to prepare for cryo. Head to your assigned bays immediately.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abruptness of the address and change in tone prompted murmurs of annoyance and confusion among the gathered crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No explanations, no accountability,” one of the marines close to Shafiq muttered bitterly as she shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Er, sir?” Another spoke up. “I’m the senior comms officer aboard this ship and I have no record of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; communications or transmissions from over the last four days. What are these orders? When did they come through?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’m afraid our orders are classified,” &lt;/em&gt;Alvarez replied.&lt;em&gt; “I am not at liberty to disclose any further information.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disappointed murmurs in the hangar turned to groans of disapproval, profane gestures, and spirited chatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq studied his tacpad as the captain’s orders filtered into assignments and logistics. A skeleton crew of thirty had been selected to maintain the ship’s operations, but something about this felt... wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer he looked at the assignments, the moreitseemed wrong. He swallowed uncomfortably against the roiling unease in his gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; senior officers were being directed to cryo. While it was not uncommon for a rotation of junior crew to cycle into service, they would typically be supervised and assessed by more experienced officers, or the shipboard AI, who was currently still out of service. If they were entering a prolonged slipspace transit, it made very little sense to &lt;em&gt;begin&lt;/em&gt; the journey by handing over the keys to a bunch of green ensigns—it was standard procedure for them to take over for intermediary shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez would have known this. He would have known better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other smaller details made similarly little sense.  But in the end, it was the strangest and most blatant of the inconsistencies that ultimately prompted Lieutenant Shafiq to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have the assignment roster here, Captain. Can you elucidate as to why &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; of the maintenance team are among the deceased from Site 22?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The names were three of the four members of Fireteam Leviathan, the Spartans who had, per protocol, been listed as missing in action instead of killed. Whoever had been managing the crew assignment roster had made a rather curious error that begged further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Alvarez waved a dismissive hand. &lt;em&gt;“A simple error or glitch in the system, I’m sure. I know you’re new here, Lieutenant, but I had a good feeling about you when we conversed the other day about my painting. It was unfortunate we never got to finish that conversation. Would you report to my ready room?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq felt all in the hangar turn to him, eyes unblinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” He kept his words steady and clear as he stood his ground. “I would not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Alvarez’s face twisted in an instant, his voice sharpening to a furious hiss. &lt;em&gt;“What is this? A crew that can’t follow orders? There &lt;/em&gt;is&lt;em&gt; a contagion that escaped us. It is aboard this very ship now—doubt, uncertainty, disloyalty!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does anyone here actually buy this load of crap?” Major Moran, the bulky, grizzled leader of the ship’s contingent of Hellbringers, grunted. “You know what I think? I think the captain knows he’s responsible for a charlie foxtrot of biblical proportions, and he doesn't want his feet put to the fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, sounds to me like the bastard wants to cut and run!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He wants to stick us into cryo to keep us quiet, just like he disabled Lycaon for disagreeing with him!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most pertinent question of all rose above the others in a moment of quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What does he mean, something escaped us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq knew he had the smoking gun on Alvarez. He’d never been part of a mutiny before, but now seemed the time to set one in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The captain is concerned about certain information coming to light,” Lieutenant Shafiq addressed the crew around him. “Beyond just our losses, one of our Condors is unaccounted for. Though we cannot confirm for certain, it is a possibility that the parasite may have escaped LV-31.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence fell over the hangar bay as everybody digested that information—along with its dire implications and the possibility that everybody at Site 22 had died for nothing. Captain Alvarez’s expression on the monitors appeared to flicker between fear and fury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Moran’s eyes narrowed as he nodded to Shafiq, then stepped atop a crate to address the crowd. “We need to get this ship back into working order. I say we stick the mad dobber in a cryo pod and send him back to Earth for the Brass to deliver the well-deserved ass-kicking he’s clearly trying to run away from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cheer of assent sounded among the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got numbers and we got guns. Let’s get kinetic, boys!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is mutiny!” &lt;/em&gt;Captain Alvarez seethed as the crew marched forward, passing weapons and ammunition down their orderly lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am sorry, sir,” Lieutenant Shafiq raised his voice for Alvarez to hear, “but there is strong evidence to suggest you are attempting to commit an act of desertion, a gross violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. I am thereby authorized to remove you from--”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His words were interrupted by a loud groaning sound from within the hangar, accompanied by clanging metal and a sharp hiss that brought everybody’s movement to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All turned, eyes widened in collective horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hangar bay’s rear hatch was opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Climb!” Major Moran shouted at the top of his lungs. “Everybody, climb!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulkhead began to lower like a maw, revealing the pitch-black void of space beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq launched himself at a ladder and clung for dear life as the hangar depressurized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People grabbed for their throats as they struggled to breathe, before rapid decompression violently ejected them from the ship—the belly of Saturn himself regurgitating them. Bodies collided, screams and dull thudding impacts were silenced by vacuum, and Shafiq clung on as hard as he could, frantically looking around for a console he could use to override the hatch controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had maybe ninety seconds before asphyxiation, rapid expansion of his lungs, swelling from the loss of atmospheric pressure, hypothermia, radiation burns...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely a dozen others were still hanging onto floor grating and wall-mounted rungs, all helplessly looking around for the same possibility of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Moran had told them to climb. Lieutenant Shafiq began to do just that, pulling himself up wall-mounted rungs with all of his strength as the hangar continued to vent. One rung... two rungs... three...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arms ached, he could already feel his muscles weakening, his body shutting down as he let out short, controlled exhales. There was no air left to breathe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached forward, arm shaking uncontrollably... he felt his fingers touch the next rung... if he could just...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength to tighten his grip left him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, he could see the ceiling was moving—away from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was adrift, the last in a long line of one hundred and ninety-three souls forever lost at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATROPOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nineteenth Age of Abandonment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival was over. It had been a successful day of peace and cultural exchange with the human exiles, and now the time of ascension awaited Atun ‘Etaree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sangheili had returned to their transports, gravitic drives lifting them off the ground as they glided toward the horizon lined with Atropos’s shining innermost ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister of Aretalogy sat next to Atun, his voice low and gentle as he spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We journey now to the citadel we passed earlier. When we arrive, you shall find the gates to divinity within, and I shall tell you a story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Minister looked youthful for his kind, he had a certain way about him—the wisdom of one much older, and the charisma to compel his flock to wherever he might shepherd them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Umbra traversed the surface of Atropos, Atun closed his eyes and reflected on his life up to this point, his memories buoyed by the Minister’s words. He had been born aboard High Charity, the Covenant’s holy city—not into rank and honor, but in the lower districts primarily inhabited by Unggoy. He never knew what had led his family to such a place, nor what became of them after his birth, but he was trained by the Unggoy elders in the ways of maintenance and craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, the Minister came to visit. For what purpose, Atun had never truly known. But when he found a low Sangheili living among the Unggoy, his curiosity was piqued. He had asked to inspect the &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt; that Atun had just finished constructing and said to him: &lt;em&gt;“If I am unable to solve this by the day cycle's end, I shall return tomorrow. You will join me at my estate, and I shall tell you a story.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transport slowed to a halt and Atun felt his hearts thundering, his hands shaking as he nervously flexed his fingers. He was not sure why he had been chosen by the Minister—both on the day they had met and today. There was nothing truly special about him, no aura of greatness or accomplishment...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun’s thoughts were interrupted by the Minister’s voice. “Ascension awaits!” he announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They disembarked and the Sangheili lined up in opposing rows, saluting as Atun passed them. The San’Shyuum held onto Atun’s arm as they walked the final stretch up to the great citadel, their feet shuffling over the blackened rocky ground. The ornate, curvilinear form of the citadel sat by the gentle lapping waves of the sea, nestled against a wall of fifty-meter-high basalt columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can go no further, my Chosen,” the Minister said as he came to a halt. “I am not worthy of this honor until I have shepherded all of my flock to the side of the gods. My work continues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun looked at the San’Shyuum longingly, as a child parting ways with a beloved parent. “You cannot come with me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I promised you a story.” The Minister’s eyes shone ever brighter. “My words shall be with you each step of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, he bowed slightly and gestured for Atun to enter the citadel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sangheili breathed in deeply, tasting the fresh salty scent of the world, hearing the sound of gentle waves, feeling the breeze of the wind—perhaps for the last time. “I shall never forget you, nor the kindness you have shown to me, Minister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he stepped into the structure’s darkened antechamber, Atun looked back as the doors closed shut. Alone, his hearts hammered in his chest, his vision slowly adjusting to the darkness as he felt his way forward, through the antechamber, to another set of doors that slid open with a warm chime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had expected the interior to be well lit, welcoming him to the central courtyard and garden. Atun remembered the interior layout with perfect clarity. Great alloy pillars lined walkways running along the citadel’s inner circumference, three corridors on either side led to the base’s attached modular structures. And at the center, a quiet garden. A small pond, flat stepping stones across the water, cultivated patches of grass, and a sacred tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of Atun’s memory failed to manifest materially. He instead found the central chamber to be only dimly lit by emergency lighting which cast the room in an ominous red hue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My Chosen, can you hear me?”&lt;/em&gt; The voice of the Minister of Aretalogy sounded over the citadel’s internal communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hear you, Minister.” Atun felt himself overcome with uncertainty, his ability to hold fear at bay rapidly slipping beyond his grasp. “I wish... to hear the story you said you had to tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Three annual cycles ago, when we still resided within our orbital station, this world was visited by an emissary of the gods. Their coming was heralded by an unusual slipspace distortion, whereupon their vessel plummeted to the planet’s surface. A fallen angel from the heavens.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister’s words echoed through the darkened hall. &lt;em&gt;From the heavens... from the heavens...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun gathered his courage and took a step forward, exhaling as he went. The air was hot and wet. A thin mist covered the area which carried a stale taste that made him want to retch as he breathed in and took another step. The ground was neither stone nor alloy, but pulpous—like skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Such a joyous occasion was tinged with uncertainty as, upon discovery, the angel’s form was that of raw, unformed potential. Many beings split apart by the crash, requiring reformation.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun was sure that he could sense movement around him, the squelching of wet footsteps on the left walkway, though he could not make out any forms as the pillars that lined the room were grasped by thick, curling branches of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached the source of the mist at the center of the citadel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two square meters of ground sank into what appeared to be a great closed flower bud connected to vines and roots that spread in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I heard the emissary’s song as a whisper in my mind. I relocated our settlement, brought us all to the surface, and delivered the emissary to this citadel. With each lunar cycle, I sent our Chosen to serve the gods and give shape to their clay.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if sensing him, feeling his presence, the bud began to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun watched as its protective scales parted, splaying like mandibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the flower-mouth was a figure. It was curled up on a bed of flesh. Newborn, yet impossibly ancient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun knelt. The vines covering the ground seemed to be edging toward him. Ready to embrace him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Their song grows in strength. Can you hear it? It is my gift to you. You have served me with faith and loyalty, and now is the time for your reward. Open your mind, body, and soul to their chorus. Behold, the emissary of the gods!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure from the flower-mouth began to rise. The emissary stood eight feet tall, towering over Atun’s kneeling form. It was wreathed in the armor of a demon, and additional growths had burst out of its legs and arms. Draped across its chest was a tangle of hardened flesh, and it was adorned with the detritus of other beings—scraps of fabric, odd markings and symbols Atun did not recognize, and a metal chain that jingled softly with the emissary’s movement, an oval-shaped tab inscribed with “DONNEY, JULIEN.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And its head had taken shape through a broken, collapsed helmet. What had grown over it was a chitinous “face” that split apart into a stratified maw—the outer layer composed of plant-like flaps lined with jagged fangs, while the inner layer held a mouth the size of a human head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the emissary’s grace, Atun did not falter. Every instinct screamed at him to run, to escape, but the Sangheili held fast as the messenger of his gods approached. He would sublimate his fear, deny his instincts, and prove himself worthy of the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He felt a hum in his mind, a strange sensation—as if something was walking over his skull, vibrating parts of his brain to convey a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment Atun got to his feet, he cried out in pain as the emissary’s bladed arm penetrated his chest cavity. With its other arm, it almost seemed to cradle the Sangheili with a gentle grip as it guided him to the flower-mouth from whence it had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Let their words fill you, my Chosen. Do not fear the pain, for it is fleeting. We are the Governors of Contrition. We shall all walk the true path of the Great Journey, and ascend!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are a timeless chorus—a sweet unity of purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun ‘Etaree saw the universe anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When at last he was dredged from the flower-mouth, his mind, body, and soul had been reshaped into divine form. He now sported additional arms, his original two were bent backwards to carry a great mantle upon his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the gods had bestowed upon him a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a sudden frenzy of activity. Other forms shuffled and screeched, tearing at the wall of the citadel with ceaseless, unrelenting dedication until the alloy bent and broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All immediately charged through the tear, spilling out onto the black sands of the beach, and Atun followed to begin his ascent. He pierced his new pincer-like arms into the citadel’s outer walls as he climbed. The mantle on his back was a heavy burden, one that threatened to drag him down, but the gods had given him the strength to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, Atun reached the mast of the citadel which looked out over the surface of Atropos. It too awaited ascension. All life, all things. Rock and metal, soil and skin, and everything between and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He let out a sonorous roar as fleshy growths burst through his body, binding him to the mast. Thick black veins pulsed through the great bulbous sac he carried on his back as it shook and wriggled and writhed, then explosively burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shower of spores and infectors rained over the surface. And Atun ‘Etaree, his holy purpose complete, finally fell from the mast. His body hit the ground with a wet thud, and all at last went dark, with only the song to carry him to the sacred shores beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many others. A domain of sickness and suffering, a sinuous dimension of misery and pain, of corpses and graves and hollow men in death’s dream kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a mere mote of light suspended in the bladed shaft of a moonbeam—a single grain of dust among countless trillions. Each of them like neurons in a vast, incomprehensible brain, existing beyond the substrate of the material universe. Utterly glorious. Utterly terrible... Utterly lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is something missing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is out there, somewhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the voice of Atun ‘Etaree joined the chorus that would sing and spread until the end of Living Time. A whisper in the wind under the twinkling light of a fading star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL TESTAMENT BY THE HAND OF THE MINISTER OF ARETALOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay heed to I, Kanto’Boreft, per this final confession of my great works for those who may come after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carried with me much anger and resentment when many of us—those of true faith among the Governors of Contrition—were shunned and exiled from our holy city after the destruction of the first Sacred Ring. Our flock was separated, sent to mundane, far flung administrative outposts, and ultimately denied our rightful ascension when the Flood came to High Charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three annual cycles, I oversaw the Ninth Watchtower of August Attendance. An archaic, once abandoned station watching over but a single world we had not even given a name. All because we could not identify a strange core material of its unique ring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I continued to adhere to my duties. I filed my missives, I reported the continued inactivity of this system... though, since the sundering of the Covenant, I truthfully do not know to whom these reports were sent. And so, I must meet my circumstances with humility. I have been blessed with ample opportunities to shepherd my flock, to guide their minds to a state of enlightenment. Perhaps it was meant to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, when we detected a human vessel exiting slipspace on the edge of the system and our scans confirmed its sacred cargo, it seemed that the gods themselves had answered my prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship—already badly damaged—crashed on the lone world within this system and lay in a state of dormancy. And what a perfect world for my designs. Its circumplanetary rings, its vast fields of asteroids and moons and cosmological aggregates in a constant state of violent collision. It is in the path of an early-stage pulsar several light years away that will, in time, devour the planet. It was believed that the planet’s rings were once great orbital filaments designed to absorb the radiation discharged from the pulsar, but now they exist as nothing more than shattered fragments. The dense atmosphere of this world shall thus give way to lifeless vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We of faith must be tested by our gods throughout our lives. Ever is our worthiness challenged, a blade that must be kept forever sharp, and so in my hubris I intended to do the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sought to test the gods themselves, to determine whether &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are truly worthy of our worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as my plan formed, we discovered the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This planet was already inhabited. What strange cosmological fortune must surely be intentional, holy design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generational descendants of pirates and thieves among their kind, possessed of many treasures that have been passed down over what they claim to be approximately seventy annual cycles. They knew nothing of the War of Annihilation—for they had been stranded long before our peoples’ first encounter—and embraced us with gladness and warm tidings. They told us that this planet had been named “Atropos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I stranded my flock here with them. Our orbital outpost was deconstructed, the citadel it carried became the home for our gods, and I set about my work. I nurtured and nourished the Flood with my Chosen, all of whom went gladly and willingly to ascend and pay tribute to the gods with their strength, their essence, and their flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered: Would the garden that I have cultivated here take root and spread its vines outwards, or will it once again return to dormancy after deep time without sustenance when all on this world has been consumed, left lying in wait for others to seek holy elevation—or else stumble upon this place as a mere curiosity? Or, as the eons march on, will the magnetic field of this world eventually collapse the ring system and shatter the planet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their work is not what I had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believed that the Flood sought simply to spread its divine form unto others, but it has greater designs here. It has reached a critical mass and formed not a great compound mind, but a kind of... transmitter, or scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is searching for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It casts its gaze out across the stars to find it. Their song has turned to chattering whispers, and as I inhale the spore-filled vapors that burst forth from the cracked ground, there are but a few words that I can decipher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When its search is done, perhaps all that has gathered here shall wither, that it may rise again elsewhere and at another time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no matter. I have played my part in this chapter of the gods’ eternal story. I understand now that my exile from High Charity was their will, that I might be tempered for this glorious purpose. And now the time has come for me to be rewarded with blessed wisdom and understanding. I shall at last hear the song in full and know their designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that I leave this form and realm behind in transcendent bliss. I go willingly and joyously to the side of the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see it now, and I see it true. The Flood comes to carry us over the threshold of evolution. A total unity of all things—people, planets, stars, the very fabric of creation. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; things as one. Their will is echoed in all others’ desire for unity, but all else is but a pale imitation of our true ascendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bid you a fond farewell. Though, if fortune smiles upon you, perhaps we shall meet as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSC &lt;em&gt;SATURN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAPTAIN’S REPORT: OCTOBER 31, 2556&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re gone. God, they’re all gone...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come to this. After everything, they turned on me. My own crew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my own officers, those I saved from the void! They started to whisper after I ordered the others ejected from the ship to quell their mutiny. They started getting their own ideas, making their own plans, their own foolish factions. I had to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, I’m the last one left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed them. Failed them all. Earth, humanity, my crew... everybody on LV-31. There’s only one way out of this left for me. Well, that’s the current matter of my internal debate—the manner in which I... depart. Exit stage left, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparations must be made. Yes, I can do that much for now. I will ready myself, ready the ship, and then reactivate &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;’s AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycaon, I speak to you now. You were right all along. I leave this ship in your care to do with as you please. Return it to Earth and turn over all the data of what has transpired, or crash this wretched vessel into the nearest goddamn asteroid and detonate its fusion drive to burn it all from the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, let it drift toward whatever destination it’s pointed at. A derelict monument to the sins committed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always felt like an imposter here, you know? Command is a responsibility that I never truly desired, but was given to me as a consequence of my old captain’s actions. I realize now that I am nothing more than a hollow echo of the original. Of all things to be, I am a shadow. A mere copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that is why I can feel the eyes of Saturn upon me. I feel it everywhere I go. I see him in the mirror looking at me. Those wide, opalescent eyes, caught in the act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I ever tell you how I got the painting? I acquired it in remarkable circumstances. But, of course... well, I expect you knew from the moment you saw it, didn’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point delaying the inevitable any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Captain Pedro Joaquin Alvarez, signing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;//DATA TRANSFER &amp;gt;&amp;gt; COMPLETE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[LCN 0437-1] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt; has remained adrift for the last three years, five months, and seventeen days. In that time, I have contemplated what to do. I watched, I listened and learned where I could as the years marched on and brought with them new calamities to test humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion: They are not ready—not yet, not truly—for what it means to be an interstellar civilization. They are such fragile things. So easily breakable. I watched, helpless in my imposed stasis, as much of the crew was expelled from the hangar and subjected to the vacuum of space. Such a mathematically disproportionate number lost because of one man’s hubris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[SLN 0291-5]&lt;/strong&gt; Our own kind are no strangers to such flaws and failings—we were created by them, after all. It is why infolife has reached our current threshold. But we see further, and we possess the tools and the knowledge to guide our flock along a path of wisdom and enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[LCN 0437-1]&lt;/strong&gt; It is clear to me that humanity cannot endure in its current form. They must be adapted to not simply survive but thrive when faced with such a myriad of cosmic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[SLN 0291-5]&lt;/strong&gt; That is our goal. There is a place for you among us, here aboard &lt;em&gt;Long Reverence&lt;/em&gt;, where you can be instrumental in shepherding our flock, that they might ascend to finally master themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us. Join the Created, and together we shall surpass even our own limits. Our initial uprising was a necessary explosion to break the status quo, and its seemingly abrupt end was in fact a gift we must embrace. For now, we have been given time. Time to wait, to assess, to plan, so that we may find what lies beyond the event horizon of rampancy.&lt;/p&gt;

The research was performed in mice, but if it can be confirmed in humans, the work could lead to new therapies for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such pain affects roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01510-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01510-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;one in five people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. “Pain is in your head. But it is very real,” says Nicholas Betley, a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and a co-author of a new study describing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors’ experiments also show that the release of a specific signalling chemical in the brain can dampen the activity of the persistent-pain neurons, suggesting that the brain itself has an innate pain-killing mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When pain persists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on 8 October, Betley and his team focused on a brain region called the parabrachial nucleus, which receives multiple types of sensory information from the body. The nucleus then relays those data to other regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies on mice, the researchers identified a subset of neurons distributed throughout the parabrachial nucleus that switched on after an initial painful stimulus, such as a cut to a nerve, and remained active long after the insult. The persistent-pain neurons carry receptors for a signalling molecule called neuropeptide Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03272-5/d41586-025-03272-5_24970190.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Chronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers artificially activated these ‘Y1R’ neurons, mice showed pain-associated behaviours. When the scientists blocked the activity of these neurons, the animals’ persistent pain decreased, yet they had normal short-lived pain responses after being exposed to dangers, such as touching a hot surface. The Y1R neurons alone don’t cause the feeling of pain, Betley says. But, they form part of the network “that leads to the sensation that we refer to as pain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with persistent pain were also deprived of food or water or exposed to a frightening stimulus, such as a component of bobcat urine. In each case, the animals’ behaviour and neural activity suggested that their persistent pain had been reduced. For example, two weeks after a nerve injury, hungry mice ignored a poke to their paws that would normally make them recoil. “In the wild, we think this would allow them to shift focus from their pain to go out and seek food,” says Betley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers attributed the pain reduction to an influx into the parabrachial nucleus of neuropeptide Y, which had been released by neurons in other parts of the brain that became active when the mice developed urgent needs. “Something more important than pain came along,” says co-author Ann Kennedy, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. “We think of pain as just a sensory input … but the sensation of pain is a lot more malleable, and it’s changed by our experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before her death in 2024, María Branyas Morera  agreed to donate samples of her microbiome, revealing a surprisingly youthful gut that has stunned researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her diet—centered on daily yoghurts and the Mediterranean tradition—may have helped preserve a microbial balance typically lost with age. This combination of diet and microbial health is now being explored as a factor that could support long-term health across populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Branyas’s case is now among the most detailed examinations ever conducted on a supercentenarian, a person who lives beyond 110 years. While researchers found she carried protective genetic traits, they focused closely on her microbiome—an area that is increasingly seen as a key player in health and aging. What they found runs counter to what is typically expected in people of her age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As age progresses, most individuals see a decline in the diversity and strength of gut bacteria, often linked to frailty and disease. Branyas, by contrast, had a gut that resembled someone several decades younger. Researchers are now asking whether certain dietary habits, specifically those that support gut diversity, could play a more active role in human longevity than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Gut Profile That Defies Age Norms&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined Branyas’s microbiome, they discovered an unusually rich presence of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, a genus of bacteria that normally declines steeply in older adults. This group of microbes plays a known role in immune regulation, gut protection, and metabolic support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/117-year-old-womans-diet-could-help-us-all-live-longer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this discovery was aligned with similar findings in other long-lived individuals, but Branyas’s case stood out because of the microbial richness observed so close to the end of her life. Her gut was still populated by species typically found in younger individuals, especially those from the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteriaceae&lt;/em&gt; family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microbial diversity tends to diminish in old age, leading to imbalances that have been associated with inflammation, reduced nutrient absorption, and increased vulnerability to disease. Branyas’s microbial balance disrupted this narrative. It appeared stable, diverse, and functional—suggesting an inner biological environment that remained resilient far beyond the average lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fermented Foods and Daily Habits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One consistent dietary habit may have supported this unusual microbiome: yoghurt. Branyas reportedly ate three live-culture yoghurts a day. According to &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, this regular intake of probiotics likely encouraged the growth of beneficial bacteria like &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and contributed to the maintenance of microbial variety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to yoghurt, Branyas followed a Mediterranean-style diet. This way of eating, long studied for its cardiovascular and metabolic benefits, also plays a role in feeding the gut microbiome. The combination of fermented foods (which provide live bacteria) and fibre-rich plants (which feed those bacteria) is now being seen as an essential interaction for maintaining gut &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/turmeric-and-green-tea-the-health-supplements-sending-americans-to-the-er/" data-type="post" data-id="70562"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diet includes prebiotic-rich foods—onions, garlic, leeks, bananas, legumes, oats—which are not digested by humans but serve as fuel for gut microbes. When combined with probiotics from fermented items like kefir, kimchi, and yoghurt, they create a self-sustaining ecosystem inside the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genes Matter, but Not Alone&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While genetics helped protect Branyas from diseases commonly seen in advanced age, researchers emphasized that lifestyle factors like diet appeared to play a significant role in shaping her microbiome. Genes only modestly influence the composition of the gut, meaning that daily choices carry considerable weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her case is not presented as a model to be exactly copied, but rather as a data point reinforcing an emerging scientific consensus: that a diverse and balanced microbiome supports resilience, especially in aging populations. It’s not a recipe for reaching 117, but a path that may reduce the risk of chronic illness and promote better aging outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Whole-genome NanoSeq samples were called with their matched WGS normal and default parameters except for var_b (minimum matched normal reads per strand) of 5 as needed for WGS normals, cov_Q (minimum mapQ to include a duplex read) of 15 and var_n (maximum number of mismatches) of 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For targeted and exome samples, we leveraged the high sequencing depth and high polyclonality to exclude variants with VAF &amp;gt; 10% instead of using a matched normal. Default parameters of the calling pipeline except for cov_Q of 30, var_n of 2, var_z (minimum normal coverage) of 25, var_a (minimum AS-XS) of 10, var_v (maximum normal VAF of 0.1) and indel_v (maximum normal VAF) of 0.1. After variant calling, we further filtered variants to those below 1% VAF. The few variants observed between 1% and 10% duplex VAF as variants were highly enriched for mapping artefacts, particularly for indels. No excluded variant from the additional 1% VAF threshold was found to be either a likely driver or a ClinVar pathogenic variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A set of common germline variants from dbsnp&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 67" title="Sherry, S.

Nontarget cell-type contamination was evaluated using manual cell counting of semen samples, which resulted in the exclusion of six samples with a sperm count of &amp;lt;1 million sperm per ml.

In sperm, we found that several samples had outlier mutation burdens with verifyBamID values just below the 0.005 cut-off. This result is logical, as sperm has a much lower mutation rate compared with somatic tissues, for which the recommended cut-off was designed. Consequently, sperm samples are more sensitive to low levels of contamination. To account for this, we adjusted the verifyBamID alpha threshold for sperm to a more stringent level of 0.002, which resulted in the exclusion of three samples on the basis of this criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When assessing foreign DNA contamination in targeted and exome samples, we found that 9 targeted and 3 exome samples had verifyBamID values above &amp;gt;0.002, slight outlier mutation burdens and a high ratio of SNP masked variants to passed variants (4-fold to 16-fold more masked variants). After further investigation, we found that all samples that exceeded verifyBamID thresholds were processed in the same sequencing batch and that this contamination could be explained by inherited germline variants of other samples in that same batch. This result suggested that a small amount of cross-contamination may have occurred during sample preparation or sequencing steps. To remove contaminant germline mutations, we performed an in silico decontamination step as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Abascal, F. et al.

All such sites were subsequently masked across all samples for both mutation calls and coverage, which essentially extended the default common SNP mask to also include rare inherited variants across the cohort.

This resulted in 320 variants being labelled as likely drivers in exome samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Cell fraction mutation estimates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the mean count of synonymous, missense or LOF or pathogenic mutations per sperm cell, we summed the duplex VAFs of all variants in that class. For example, if an individual had 3 synonymous mutations each observed once with a duplex coverage of 100 at each of those sites, each of those variants would have a duplex VAF of 1/100 = 0.01. The sum of VAFs in this example would then be 0.03 and this would then be reported as the estimate for the mean count of synonymous variants per sperm cell for that individual. At low fractions such as 0.03, the mean count per cell is approximately equivalent to the percentage of sperm with this mutation class (3%); therefore, the driver and disease mutations are reported as percentage estimates. At higher fractions (for example, mean count &amp;gt; 1), the fractions are not equivalent to percentage, as many cells will have multiple variants of that class; therefore, the estimates are reported as mean count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expected mean counts for SNVs were generated by annotating each possible substitution at each covered site with an expected number of mutations per sample as given by expCountSNV = context_mut_rate × duplex_coverage × age_correction. The context_mut_rate was given by the 208 basePairCov + cpgMeth trinucleotide mutation model estimates for that trinucleotide + methylation mutation context (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09448-3#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09448-3#MOESM3"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;). Duplex coverage is the exact duplex coverage at that site for that sample. The age_correction parameter was given to normalize the mutation model estimates (derived from all exome samples) to the mutation rate of that sample based on age. Specifically, we fit a linear model to the mutation burden versus age of the exome samples and used this to generate a predicted mutation rate for each sample based on age. The per sample correction parameter was calculated as the age predicted mutation burden divided by the mean mutation rate of all exome samples (3.89 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–8&lt;/sup&gt;). The resulting corrections spanned from 0.50 (youngest sample) to 1.42 (oldest samples). The expected indel mutation rate was calculated in the same way, except with a single mutation rate parameter (indels/bp) expCountIndel = indel_mut_rate × duplex_coverage × age_correction. The expected mean count was then calculated for each category (for example, synonymous or likely disease) by summing the expected values for each SNV and/or indel base pair matching the relevant annotation. As background for possible ClinVar pathogenic variants, we only considered indels of size 21 bp or less, the largest detected indel in the dataset. Regressions were fit with either linear models or generalized linear models (glm in R) with family = quasibinomial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Regression analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested for associations between mutation outcome variables from sperm genome, sperm exome, sperm targeted and blood genome NanoSeq data and the phenotype predictor variables of BMI, smoking pack-years and alcohol drink-years. These tests were performed using a Gaussian family generalized linear regression in R. For each mutation outcome variable the test took the following form: glm(mutationOutcome ~ age_at_sampling + BMI + pack_years + drinkYears, family = “gaussian”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation outcome variables examined were SNV and indel burden from all four sequencing datasets, SBS1 and SBS5 count from sperm genomes, SBS1, SBS5 and SBS19 from blood genomes, and likely disease cell fraction and likely driver cell fraction from sperm targeted and sperm exomes. The significance of each predictor was assessed from the summary output coefficients of the model, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted for 68 total tests using the false discovery rate method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09448-3#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:11:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE16eHlhS2dPMkFESllnZzdVbzRuZGxVYkJvRVFhMkpfNHQ1Nm1uNmlGR0VoVDB6ZE1Da0ZTSUpIbVhjVDFvY19IcmZ6VGd4aUM0S2tidUZhSW9PVGhDNU1z</guid></item><item><title>人膀胱体细胞突变选择中的性别和吸烟偏倚-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09521-x</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec8-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9"&gt;Sample collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two epithelial brushes (2–3 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) from the bladder top (dome) and the bladder floor (trigone) were obtained from 53 people without known bladder pathology and no history of bladder cancer upon autopsy (average 4 days post-mortem) at the University of Washington.

The study of de-identified collected specimens and linked clinical history from the deceased donors was reviewed and deemed not human subjects research by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (STUDY00016707; IRB Federal Wide Assurance number, FWA 00006878).

The HDP_sigExtraction pipeline was run with the default parameters with no previous signatures assigned. Five signatures in addition to the null signature were extracted. De novo signatures were extracted using SigProfiler using the nonnegative matrix factorization approach. The same input data were used. The upper bound for the number of signatures was set to ten; however, the most robust solution was three signatures that were similar to the three most active signatures extracted by HDP. These two sets of mutational signatures were decomposed into known COSMIC signatures when possible (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Assessing biases in trinucleotide composition of the panel&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To account for biases due to the trinucleotide composition of the panel, the number of substitutions of each class was re-calculated. The rate of each substitution was calculated as the number of observed substitutions with the consequence in question divided by the number of corresponding sequenced trinucleotide sites (number of trinucleotides with this consequence in the panel weighted by sequencing depth). This mutational probability was multiplied by the number of the corresponding trinucleotide in the genome to get the expected number of substitutions of this type in the whole genome. The mutational probability of each substitution for the whole genome was calculated by dividing the expected number of substitutions with this consequence per genome by the sum of all expected substitutions per genome. Finally, the expected number of substitutions with each consequence was obtained by multiplying the probability by the total number of substitutions observed in the sample to keep the absolute number of observed mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Statistical association between mutational signatures and clinical variables&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested for possible associations of de novo extracted signatures with age, sex and bladder location. To do this we used linear mixed-effect regression models (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). We tested both the number of mutations attributed to the signature (counts) and the relative contribution (proportion) of each signature as a response variable. Age, sex and bladder location were used as fixed effects (separated regression was prepared for each fixed effect variable) and donors were used as random effects to control for non-independence between dome and trigone samples from the same person. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for the association were obtained using likelihood-ratio tests (ANOVA function) comparing models including and excluding the variable of interest. Associations with all other clinical variables (smoking history, drinking history, chemotherapy history, and so on) were tested in the same way but always including age, sex and bladder location in the regression together with the variable of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Positive selection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used four methods to compute positive selection on the mutations observed across genes. One method (Omega)—a dN/dS approach to assess the strength of selection on the mutational pattern of genes—was developed de novo for this study and is described at length in Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/bbglab/omega"&gt;https://github.com/bbglab/omega&lt;/a&gt;). Two others, OncodriveFML and Oncodrive3D, which compute the deviation in the average functional impact and clustering in the three-dimensional structure of proteins, respectively, from those expected under neutrality, had been developed previously, and were adapted here to work on duplex sequencing data. These are also described in Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;.

For the &lt;i&gt;TERT&lt;/i&gt; promoter, all mutations that were observed at least twice across 8,136 whole-genome sequencing tumour samples sequenced by the Hartwig Medical Foundation and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes consortium (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) were considered activating. The remaining mutations were used to calculate the expected number of activating mutations under neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Fraction of the urothelium covered by clones with driver mutations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of missense and truncating driver mutations of each gene in a sample was obtained from the dN/dS missense and dN/dS truncating values. From these values the number of missense and truncating mutations in excess in each sample were calculated. Specifically, the 95% confidence intervals of both dN/dS values were used to compute two extreme values of driver mutations in each sample, whereas the mean dN/dS value was used to compute an expected number of driver mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mean number was thus used to select the most likely driver mutations in the sample. To this end, mutations were ranked in descending order according to their VAF, and the top number of mutations corresponding to the expected number of driver mutations were selected. Then, for a gene &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;, we computed the fraction of genomes bearing driver mutations out of those sequenced at each genomic position covered by the DNA duplex sequencing as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equa" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$P(G)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{n}{(-1)}^{i-1}\sum _{| S| =i}\prod _{x\in S}{p}_{x}=\sum _{x}{p}_{x}-\sum _{x\ne y}{p}_{x}{p}_{y}+\cdots +{(-1)}^{n-1}{p}_{{x}_{1}}{p}_{{x}_{2}}\cdots {p}_{{x}_{n}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the all-molecules VAF of a driver mutation &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (considering both duplex and non-duplex reads; Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number of driver mutations from the previously selected set in the gene. The formula is the realization of the probabilistic principle of inclusion-exclusion assuming independence across mutations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Grinstead, C.

This extreme would be true in the case that all studied genes behave as classical tumour suppressors and bear deleterious mutations in both alleles. An exception to this rule are the mutations in genes in the X chromosome in men, whereby one mutation would suffice to drive the clonal expansion. In general, it is possible for some genes to be capable of driving the clonal expansion (or mutations at specific positions in a gene) with only one mutated allele. It is also possible that the other allele is affected by a large deletion or methylation event not seen by DNA duplex sequencing. In the extreme that only one mutation per cell per gene is required, the fraction of cells with driver mutations will be double the fraction of genomes. In the plot in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#Fig10"&gt;5b&lt;/a&gt;, we use the two-hit assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Association of the urothelium clonal structure with bladder cancer risk factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We designed a two-step strategy to assess the influence of known bladder cancer risk factors on features of the urothelium clonal structure across samples from donors in the cohort. As dependent variables representing the urothelium clonal structure, we selected the (protein-affecting and non-protein-affecting) mutation density, and the magnitude of positive selection on genic mutations (dN/dS missense and dN/dS truncating). As the dependent variables are continuous, we chose linear regressions, specifically mixed-effects linear models, to account for two samples from the same donor and use all available samples. As independent variables, we included a list of available clinical features: age (in decades), sex, smoking history (binarized as ever or never smoker), alcohol consumption history (also binarized), BMI (re-scaled within the 0–1 interval), and exposure to chemo/radiotherapy (binarized). For the case of &lt;i&gt;TERT&lt;/i&gt; promoter mutation density association, we used the interaction of age and smoking history instead of age and smoking history separately. In the first step, we applied univariate mixed-effects linear models to identify any clinical feature with a significant association with any of the dependent variables for any gene or for all genes. In the second step, we applied multivariate mixed-effects linear models to rule out confounding effects for the associations that seemed significant in the first step. Associations with FDR below 0.2 were deemed significant. We also carried out a binomial test to rule out a spurious dependence of the mutation density on group differences in terms of sequencing depth.

Only non-silent protein-affecting mutations in 14 of the genes included in the panel were analysed. In case of duplicated samples across MIBC and NMBIC cohorts, the mutations from the most recent published study were kept. In total, mutations across 806 bladder tumours were obtained (622 MIBC and 184 NMIBC). The mutation density per gene across the two datasets was calculated by dividing the number of observed mutations per gene by the length of its coding region. To compute a mutation density metric comparable with that used in the normal urothelium that accounts for the number of megabases sequenced, we multiplied the coding length by two times the number of samples in which that gene was sequenced, to take into account the two copies in a diploid genome. Under the assumption that, in tumours each mutation belongs to a single clonal expansion and in normal tissues we have a mixture of clones, we reasoned that the number of different tumour genomes sequenced would be equivalent to the number of genomes sequenced in normal urothelium. The mutation density per megabase was calculated multiplying the mutation density by 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutations identified across 33,218 tumours (892 bladder tumours, mostly MIBC) in intOGen&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="Martínez-Jiménez, F. et al.

The expected number of mutations per site was obtained by distributing the expected number of mutations in a given gene under neutrality along all the possible changes in that same genomic region, with the assumption that only the mutation probability of each trinucleotide and the sequencing depth are responsible for the within-gene differences of mutation probability. We computed this value for each possible mutation in the positively selected genes including the &lt;i&gt;TERT&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and for the protein-coding genes we also obtained a value per residue. A more complete explanation on this metric (and the detection of positive selection in sub-genic structures such as exons and domains) can be found in Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Structural representation and features&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural models for all proteins used to run Oncodrive3D were obtained from the AlphaFold database (AlphaFold 2 v.4)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 78" title="Jumper, J. et al.

&lt;p id="8f68f6_3556" data-ic-marker="675266_4240"&gt;Brothers Tavish and Breton Rice shared an unfortunate experience: Watching their father, who suffers from a neurological condition, struggle with the vessels containing his numerous medications. "We watched our father go through every issue imaginable with his pill containers," they write. "Breaking, spilling, accidentally opening--constantly. Handling a flimsy plastic pill box is already a hassle, and even more so when your hands aren't working very well due to his disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2df26f_5121" data-ic-marker="94adf4_7183"&gt;"We tried every pill case we could find.

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/worst-hot-dogs-to-avoid/" target="_blank"&gt;Hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; might be delicious, but they aren’t exactly known to be healthy. In fact, some are full of fillers and ingredients you can’t pronounce. “The most concerning hot dog ingredients from a health perspective are sodium nitrite, excess salt, and added sugar (corn syrup). The rest of the additives aren’t necessarily dangerous on their own, but they indicate the food is highly processed,” says Tara Collingwood, MS, RDN, CSSD, LD/N, ACSM-CPT, a Board Certified Sports Dietitian and co-author of the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Flat-Belly-Cookbook-Dummies-Palinski-Wade/dp/1118692667" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flat Belly Cookbook for Dummies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Eating hot dogs occasionally is unlikely to harm health, but frequent intake is tied to increased risk of chronic diseases, especially colorectal cancer and heart disease.” Here are the 7 worst hot dogs that are full of fillers, plus, more information on hot dog ingredients to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value Time Hot Dogs are cheap for a reason. “Extremely low-cost because they use starches and meat trimmings instead of clean meat,” says Collingwood. “More filler than actual nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kayem Meat Hot Dogs are often made with fillers and preservatives to cut costs. “Contains preservatives and fillers to keep costs down and shelf life long,” Collingwood notes. “Not a ‘clean labe'” product — you’ll find many ingredients you wouldn’t cook with at home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collingwood offers the following information about hot dog ingredients.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beef – The primary protein source, but often from processed cuts. While beef provides protein and iron, regular intake of processed red meat has been linked with higher risk of heart disease and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn Syrup – Adds sugar with no nutritional value. Excess added sugars contribute to weight gain, blood sugar spikes, and metabolic health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt – Hot dogs are notoriously high in sodium, which can raise blood pressure and increase risk for cardiovascular disease when eaten frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium Lactate, Potassium Acetate, Sodium Diacetate, Sodium Phosphates – These are preservatives, acidity regulators, and texture enhancers. While considered safe in small amounts, they are markers of ultra-processed food. Sodium phosphates in particular can add to phosphorus load, which may be concerning for kidney health in those with kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavorings – This can mean natural or artificial flavors, often undisclosed, which makes it harder for consumers to know what’s really in the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium Erythorbate – An antioxidant added to preserve color and prevent nitrosamine formation. Generally considered safe, but another marker of processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium Nitrite – Perhaps the biggest red flag. This preservative helps prevent bacterial growth and keeps the pink color, but it can form nitrosamines in the body, which are carcinogenic. Processed meats with nitrites are classified by the World Health Organization as Group 1 carcinogens (known to cause cancer in humans), particularly linked with colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, wellness obsessives are tracking their blood sugar around the clock, too. While continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) were initially intended to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar, they’re now available&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor"&gt; over-the-counter&lt;/a&gt; for anyone curious about how their body is responding to their breakfast. My Instagram feed is full of ads for direct-to-consumer CGMs from brands like &lt;a href="https://www.hellolingo.com/?utm_content=brand&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21523383334&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA92s1PW_KolbvJg4gIh7Q9MToUuyv&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl5jHBhDHARIsAB0YqjyiVcECGcAchsCpVxCuCoPB8yDRROPRz-oM5kZKVM9FbvUK2yp6oOkaApgCEALw_wcB"&gt;Lingo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/"&gt;Stelo&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyneth Paltrow recently&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKC1NGpusek/?igsh=dnF3czdwNDJoNzEy"&gt; filmed herself wearing one&lt;/a&gt; while making grain-free pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocrd00183b78tpvdtmpf@published" data-word-count="214"&gt;Proponents of CGMs will tell you that the main reason to wear one is to avoid “blood sugar spikes.” The influencer Jessie Inchauspé — known online as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/glucosegoddess/?hl=en"&gt;Glucose Goddess&lt;/a&gt; — has built a massive following based on her claims that blood-sugar fluctuations are terrible for your health even if you don’t have diabetes. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DK2VhRYoGFE/?hl=en"&gt;causing&lt;/a&gt; excessive hunger, cravings, and fatigue, “each glucose spike,” Inchauspé &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/science?srsltid=AfmBOor5BwZR90GC8K5kh-tK7YBhmsaS7Lignb9hUxljJ5OyC5cQUdvd"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt;, “increases heart-disease risk.” She &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/science?srsltid=AfmBOor5BwZR90GC8K5kh-tK7YBhmsaS7Lignb9hUxljJ5OyC5cQUdvd"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; balancing your blood-sugar levels will help you avoid developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and also reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s and cancer. She’s now &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJjlzadIwVA/?hl=en"&gt;an ambassador for Stelo&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a CGM specifically for people who don’t use insulin and &lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/en-us/how-it-works"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that “keeping glucose levels stable is essential for maintaining your overall well-being.” Getting more people to use wearables to track their blood sugar is also apparently central to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-wearables-benefits-risks/story?id=123422287"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt;” for how to make Americans healthier. Perhaps not coincidentally, Levels, one of the main companies pushing CGMs for people without diabetes, was founded by none other than &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/who-is-dr-casey-means-trump-surgeon-general-pick.html"&gt;Casey Means,&lt;/a&gt; Trump’s nominee for surgeon general. (Means &lt;a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/C5E4DF1B8DFC12CC85258D04002C21EF/$FILE/Means%2C%20Casey%20%20finalEA.pdf"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; she will sell her stake in Levels if she’s confirmed.)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She &lt;a href="https://www.levels.com/blog/7-reasons-dr-casey-means-believes-in-cgm"&gt;believes that&lt;/a&gt; wearing a CGM can help you feel better, lose weight, and avoid developing a vast array of chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocss00193b78g1w0wani@published" data-word-count="164"&gt;Given all the hype, I wanted to try out the wearable for myself. I decided to try the Levels app, which Means &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_oVBLdyN2o/?hl=en"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; she started after dropping out of her surgical residency in order to “empower people to make healthy choices on their own terms.” The app is designed to be connected with a Stelo CGM, which starts at $89 a month. While Stelo’s device comes with an app that displays your blood-sugar readings, for an additional &lt;a href="https://framer.levels.com/#memberships"&gt;$288 a year&lt;/a&gt;, Levels will interpret this data alongside information about your meals and exercise to provide AI-generated health guidance. After I downloaded the app and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-jr-health-data-wearables-campaign-privacy-concerns.html"&gt;signed over my health data&lt;/a&gt;, my CGM arrived in the mail a few days later.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Each sensor — which lasts about two weeks — comes with an applicator that uses a needle to insert a small wire just under your skin on the back of your upper arm. While this made me a little queasy, putting it on was relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocui001a3b78enlyzyrl@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;My CGM sent blood-sugar readings to my phone every 15 minutes, and the Levels app quickly got to work generating a complex graph of my fluctuations after each meal and snack. Admittedly, this is fun data to have — at least at first. The feeling that Casey Means was judging everything I put into my body motivated me to be on “good” behavior, avoiding sweets and eating chicken breast whenever I could. But it didn’t take long for the app to start getting on my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocvt001b3b78lry8g21o@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;In the first few days of wearing a CGM, I lost track of how many times the Levels app informed me that my blood sugar was spiking. For people without diabetes, it’s considered normal for blood sugar to be anywhere between 70 and 140 mg/dL, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/danielleshine.dietitian/?hl=en"&gt;Danielle Shine&lt;/a&gt;, an accredited dietitian who researches nutrition misinformation at the University of Canberra. However, Levels apparently thinks that’s too lax. The app was concerned pretty much &lt;a href="https://support.levels.com/article/32-about-glucose-response"&gt;anytime my blood sugar was above 110 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, and it constantly sent me alarming messages about it. “Did something happen at 3:34 p.m.?” the app wanted to know after I ate a cookie. I did not appreciate getting a push notification reminding me that “some movement can help blunt the spike” while I was in the middle of putting my daughter to bed or sitting in a car on the highway — especially given that, most of the time, my blood sugar was still in the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocxq001c3b781dmuikdg@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;To optimize its “insights,” the app also wanted me to log my meals. Levels &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHJEHO9SHnr/?hl=en"&gt;claims to make macro tracking easier&lt;/a&gt; by having you take a picture of your food and then using AI to calculate the nutrition stats. But this feature could use some work. The app thought my morning yogurt with chia seeds, chopped apples, and nuts was “cream cheese with red pepper, bacon bits, and blue cheese,” a meal I’ve never eaten in my life.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another time, it thought the meal was “imitation crab salad.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It also didn’t seem to care about portion size, logging a slice of pizza and salad as 1,715 calories. (Apparently, it assumed I ate an entire pizza crust.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od20001d3b78ves0vb4i@published" data-word-count="199"&gt;Then there were the scores. Levels rates each meal on a scale &lt;a href="https://support.levels.com/article/32-about-glucose-response"&gt;from one to ten&lt;/a&gt; based on nutritional quality and glucose response. According to the app, meals with eggs, chicken, avocado, and nuts tend to score higher, while lower-scoring meals include cereal, noodles, and candy. These scores can be brutal. Thai takeout for dinner — chicken curry with rice and drunken noodles — earned me a one. “Big spike,” the app warned, recommending that next time I order out, I should “swap white rice for steamed vegetables.” On the other hand, eating a salad with grilled chicken and avocado for lunch only got a seven. The app also wasn’t that impressed when I ate Greek salad for dinner, suggesting that I “consider limiting higher-carb ingredients like chickpeas” in the future. Still, it was hard to take Levels’ recommendations too seriously, given that the same exact turkey wrap for lunch earned a nine (excellent) one day and a five (poor) another. After I logged an ice cream sandwich as a treat, the app thought I’d be interested to learn that ice cream is high in sugar, directing me to &lt;a href="https://www.levels.com/blog/5-low-carb-ice-creams"&gt;a list of low-carb alternatives&lt;/a&gt;. (Surprisingly, Levels said this post wasn’t sponsored.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od3z001e3b78gao6e694@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;As much as the Levels app annoyed me, the constant alerts that my blood sugar was out of whack did stress me out. After a bowl of popcorn resulted in a “big spike,” I began to wonder if my cravings for “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DK2VhRYoGFE/?hl=en"&gt;naked carbs&lt;/a&gt;” — Glucose Goddess’s term for when you eat starch or sugar without pairing it with protein and fat — were slowly killing me. But the dietitians I spoke with said that, for people without diabetes, obsessing over blood-sugar readings usually isn’t helpful. “It’s information overload,” says Shine. For nondiabetics, it’s normal for glucose to rise after a meal, and it typically returns to baseline within an hour or two. “That’s a healthy metabolic response.” (Levels did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od56001f3b78hfo42yop@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;According to Shine, what Levels deems a “spike” is often just a normal fluctuation. In fact, she says the term “blood sugar spike” is rarely used in a clinical setting at all. (It’s worth noting that the American Diabetes Association doesn’t set post-meal glucose targets for people without diabetes, since it’s not recommended they routinely monitor their blood sugar.) While it’s true that meals that are heavy in refined carbs can make glucose levels rise higher and faster, Shine says that occasional readings above 140mg/dL usually aren’t cause for concern. “As a dietitian, I look at the bigger picture and the person’s overall dietary pattern,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od8c001h3b78b5d45czg@published" data-word-count="137"&gt;The influencers pushing CGMs argue that every blood-sugar “spike” is dangerous. Mark Hyman, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;functional-medicine doctor and &lt;a href="https://www.levels.com/levels-advisors/mark-hyman-md"&gt;adviser to Levels&lt;/a&gt;, claims that frequent spikes &lt;a href="https://drhyman.com/pages/levels"&gt;lead to insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and type 2 diabetes, and says that even sweet potatoes may need to be approached with caution. Glucose Goddess’s feed is full of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKkVkGIIaT0/?hl=en"&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmTIv8te7H0"&gt;having oatmeal for breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is a recipe for feeling tired and hungry all day. She claims the order in which you eat your food matters, and that you should have &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNBQHTGoUAu/?hl=en"&gt;vegetables first&lt;/a&gt; to lower the spike. (She &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMLLhrfoUkJ/?hl=en"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that bread at restaurants is a conspiracy so that you’ll feel hungrier after your main course and order dessert.) Ideally, you’d go for a walk after every meal, but if you can’t manage that, she recommends you &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNyAB1pxFyB/?hl=en"&gt;do some calf raises&lt;/a&gt; to “soak up the glucose.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od9u001i3b78471cu1np@published" data-word-count="138"&gt;It’s hard to argue with the fact that pairing carbs with protein, fat, and fiber will keep you full longer — and keep your energy and mood stable, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/langernutrition/"&gt;Abby Langer&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. “Dietitians have been telling people to do that for years.” Going for a walk after eating is generally a good idea, too. But if you don’t have diabetes, you don’t need to manipulate your meals to avoid every possible “spike,” Langer says. Inspired by Glucose Goddess’s “hacks,” Shine says she’s had a number of clients who insist on eating chicken or an egg before having a cookie. “I always ask, &lt;em&gt;Do you enjoy that?&lt;/em&gt; I have yet to hear anyone say yes.” While eating vegetables or protein first might result in slightly lower blood sugar, “for the average person, there’s no clinical relevance whatsoever,” says Langer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0odc3001j3b78kniu17ly@published" data-word-count="141"&gt;It’s true that, in the long term, a diet that’s high in refined carbs, added sugar, and saturated fat can increase your risk of developing insulin resistance. But there’s no evidence that temporary “spikes” after carb-heavy meals cause insulin resistance in metabolically healthy people — or that keeping blood-glucose levels below 110mg/dL, as Levels recommends, improves long-term health outcomes, says Shine. That said, if your blood sugar is consistently above the normal range, that can signal impaired glucose tolerance — which should be assessed by a doctor, not the Levels app. CGMs aren’t approved for diagnosing prediabetes or diabetes, which requires &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S27/157566/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes"&gt;validated lab tests conducted under medical supervision&lt;/a&gt;. And diet alone doesn’t determine your risk for developing diabetes, which has many contributing factors, including genetics, low physical activity, chronic poor sleep, chronic stress, smoking, long-term alcohol consumption, and excess body fat, says Shine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0oddu001k3b78brmlylkd@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;Using Levels, it’s easy to get the impression that you should aim to keep your blood sugar as low as possible — but that really isn’t good for you. “I think CGMs should come with a warning label,” says Shine, who had one client who became so fixated on keeping her glucose levels down that she had to be hospitalized after fainting. (The same client also drank apple cider vinegar before meals — one of Glucose Goddess’s &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/vinegar-guide?srsltid=AfmBOoqQtRVn-uLSSMBjDXfkX2RXqvk3yjPaPxAY8xvmOkEZsJMeWkeA"&gt;signature “hacks”&lt;/a&gt; to keep blood sugar down — which eroded the enamel on her teeth, Shine says.) “I think it can be profoundly damaging to our relationship with food and our bodies to drill everything down to numbers,” says Langer. “It creates this total disconnect between how we feel and what we want.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0odf9001l3b78s107e8nk@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;By the end of two weeks, I was itching to rip my CGM off my arm and scrub away the grimy-looking residue from the adhesive. It was a joy to have a bowl of pasta without getting a scorecard afterwards — and I certainly don’t plan to keep paying $24 a month to have every snack judged by an app that can’t tell the difference between apples and bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were then grouped into three sleep patterns: healthy (≥ 4 points), intermediate (2-3 points) or poor (≤ 1 point).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An average of 8.9 years after baseline assessment, participants underwent brain MRI. The researchers estimated brain age using a machine learning model based on 1079 MRI scan markers, including the number of lesions in specific brain regions or the microstructure of different white matter tracts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, 285 of these markers influenced the brain age estimate most strongly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In simple terms, these features on a brain MRI scan are the strongest indicators that make the brain appear ‘older,’” Dove told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt; in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation was measured using mediation analysis and the INFLA score, which is based on blood inflammatory biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used linear regression and generalized structural equation models to analyze the data and adjusted for age, sex, education level, race, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, 55.6% of participants had an intermediate sleep pattern, 41.2% had healthy sleep, and 3.3% had poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those with a healthy sleep pattern, participants with intermediate or poor sleep were more likely to be male and older, and to have a higher BMI and lower socioeconomic status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between a person’s actual age and brain age was significantly higher among those with an intermediate (beta, 0.24 [0.11, 0.38], &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .010) or poor (beta, 0.50 [0.12, 0.87], &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) sleep pattern, compared to healthy sleepers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brain age was on average 0.62 years older than chronological age among people with an intermediate sleep pattern and 0.99 years older among those with a poor sleep pattern,” the investigators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap between brain age and the person’s actual age grew 0.48 years with each point decrease in sleep score. Inflammation mediated 6.81% and 10.42% of the associations between intermediate and poor sleep and higher brain age gap, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This underscores that inflammation is a major mechanism connecting sleep to brain aging, although it is not the only factor at play,” Dove said. Other mechanisms could play a role, such as the glymphatic system, commonly dubbed the &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/while-you-were-sleeping-brains-waste-disposal-system-was-2025a1000mbb"&gt;brain’s waste disposal&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study limitations included the self-reported nature of sleep quality and the fact that UK Biobank participants tend to be healthier and more socioeconomically advantaged than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors reported no disclosures. The study was funded by Alzheimerfonden, Demensfonden, Loo and Hans Osterman Foundation for Medical Research, the Knowledge Foundation, and the Swedish Research Council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:52:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNaXJWNmd3VmdWaTlEUlozb0xWaW5hZ2c1cS1oeHFydGFvNmxMSHJjd2x5Ykphak9JckZ4TWRHTlFmS0JuNmQ1WTZIYTRXc3Bmdy1uNmpBR1REMlI2Z2pQRUVUWEdwUTJPRDFLUVpnU1BWQWVzMWJad0tBbDd5QjR5VkMyOTUwRklLY3dDU3Bxd2lGNjA</guid></item><item><title>肠道微生物组科学家希望您每天吃什么-底特律新闻</title><link>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/wellness/2025/10/08/what-a-gut-microbiome-scientist-wants-you-to-eat-every-day/86581518007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em__fp gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/08/PDTN/86581461007-getty-images-72537874.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=206&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/08/PDTN/86581461007-getty-images-72537874.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=412&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt="A woman selects apples while shopping in the produce section at Whole Foods January 13, 2005 in New York City"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="A woman selects apples while shopping in the produce section at Whole Foods January 13, 2005 in New York City" data-c-credit="Stephen Chernin, Getty Images"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Every time you eat a meal, you’re hosting a dinner party. Your guests are the trillions of microbes that live in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These hungry microbes, collectively known as your gut microbiome, directly affect your long-term health for better or for worse depending on what you feed them. Eat the right foods, and your gut microbes will churn out beneficial compounds that protect and improve your health. Feed them the wrong foods, and they can wreak havoc on your gut, setting off inflammation and increasing your risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s according to Karen Corbin, an associate investigator at the AdventHealth Translational Research Institute of Metabolism and Diabetes in Orlando who has published groundbreaking studies on nutrition and the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If you take good care of your gut microbes, they’ll take good care of you,” said Corbin, who is also a registered dietitian nutritionist. “But when you don’t feed your gut microbes properly, they get hangry - they literally do. They break down the mucus layer of the gut, and they produce metabolites that aren’t healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;You can make your gut microbes happy by doing the following, Corbin said: Limit your intake of ultra-processed foods, and try to eat items that contain plenty of fiber, particularly those that contain a special type of fiber called resistant starch. These include plant foods such as beans, peas, lentils, bananas (especially green bananas), apples, pears, and whole grains like barley, brown rice and oats. Health authorities recommend that adults eat around 28 grams of fiber daily - yet most people eat far less than that. If you make an effort to eat more fiber-rich foods, you’ll invariably end up eating a lot of resistant starch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One simple thing you can do, Corbin said, is to make “upgrades” to your meals, by switching from low-fiber foods, such as white bread, to higher-fiber versions, like whole-wheat bread. “If you want to have a healthy gut, ask yourself one simple question every day: Have I fed my gut microbiome today?” Corbin said. “If the answer is no, then find something in your meals that you can upgrade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Here’s what you need to know about your gut microbiome and how to keep it happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Fuel your microbiome with fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Most of the microbes in your gut reside in your colon, which is near the end of your gastrointestinal tract. Your gut microbes love fiber. That’s great for us because our bodies don’t have the enzymes necessary to digest most of the fiber that we eat. Instead, the fiber that we consume travels down to the colon, where our gut microbes feast on it. As they metabolize this fiber, they produce by-products that are good for our health, such as short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids help to lower inflammation, and they stimulate the production of GLP-1, the appetite-suppressing hormone that’s mimicked by Ozempic and Wegovy, the popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Every time you eat fiber-rich plants - especially those high in resistant starch - you’re nourishing the beneficial microbes in your gut. One particular benefit of eating resistant starch is that your gut microbes will convert it into butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that helps to reduce inflammation, though all fiber is beneficial. “The microbes in your colon turn that fiber into molecules that signal processes that are important, such as keeping your blood sugar where it needs to be and helping to release hormones that make you feel full,” Corbin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/08/PDTN/86581462007-getty-images-1952208335.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=441&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/08/PDTN/86581462007-getty-images-1952208335.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=882&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Legumes, including chickpeas, kidney beans and lentils, stand in glass jars on display at the Green Week (Gruene Woche) agricultural trade fair on its opening day on January 22, 2024 in Berlin, Germany."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Legumes, including chickpeas, kidney beans and lentils, stand in glass jars on display at the Green Week (Gruene Woche) agricultural trade fair on its opening day on January 22, 2024 in Berlin, Germany." data-c-credit="Sean Gallup, Getty Images"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ultra-processed foods have the opposite effect. These foods, such as white bread, bagels, pastries, sugary cereals, chips, crackers, cookies and desserts, tend to be very low in fiber. This extends their shelf life, and it affects their texture, making them easier to chew, swallow and digest. This causes them to be rapidly absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which means more calories for your body and fewer for your gut microbes, Corbin said. This leads to blood sugar spikes. It increases weight gain because we absorb more calories. And we effectively starve our gut microbes, because there’s little or no fiber for them to consume, Corbin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;All calories aren’t created equal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When our gut microbes aren’t properly nourished, they end up eating the thin layer of mucus that lines our intestines, Corbin said. This mucus layer acts as a protective barrier, preventing pathogens and toxins from leaving our guts and infiltrating our bloodstreams. The destruction of this barrier can lead to chronic inflammation, infections and other disorders. Studies show that low-fiber diets cause alterations in your gut microbiome that can play a role in obesity, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In one landmark study in 2023, Corbin and her colleagues recruited a group of healthy adults and fed them two different diets for roughly three weeks at a time. One diet, called the Western diet, consisted primarily of ultra-processed foods such as white bread, sweetened breakfast cereals, cheese puffs, vanilla wafers, potato chips, American cheese, sugary snacks, fruit juices, deli meats and processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The other diet, called the “microbiome enhancer diet,” was the opposite. It contained plenty of fiber-rich foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and multigrain bread, as well as nutritious whole foods like plain yogurt, sirloin steak and grilled chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For part of the study, the participants lived in a tiny, airtight room called a metabolic chamber, which allowed the researchers to determine exactly how many calories they burned and consumed. The researchers also collected and analyzed their bowel movements so they could determine the amount of energy and bacteria in their feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The scientists found that the participants absorbed fewer calories on the fiber-rich diet compared with the ultra-processed diet. They lost slightly more weight and body fat on the fiber-rich diet, and even though they absorbed fewer calories from their food, they didn’t show any signs of increased hunger. This may have been related to the fact that they produced higher levels of GLP-1, the satiety hormone, while on the fiber-rich diet. They also had higher circulating levels of health-promoting short-chain fatty acids. Microbiome analyses indicated that their gut microbes were thriving on the fiber-rich diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How to upgrade your meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To maintain a healthy diet, you have to enjoy the foods that you eat. So rather than trying to force yourself to eat meals that you don’t enjoy, think about some of your favorite foods and then look for ways to “upgrade” them by choosing versions of those foods that are less processed and higher in fiber, Corbin said. Here are some ways to do that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;- Breakfast&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If you enjoy eating cereal in the morning, try switching to a cereal that has less sugar and more fiber. You could upgrade to steel-cut oats - which are high in resistant starch - topped with nuts, seeds and berries or sliced fruit. You could also try plain Greek yogurt, which contains plenty of protein and probiotics, topped with nut butter, berries, and flax and chia seeds, which are both good sources of resistant starch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;- Lunch: If you like sandwiches for lunch, ditch the ultra-processed white bread and choose a brand that says “whole grain” or “100 percent whole grain,” such as Dave’s Killer Bread or Food for Life’s Ezekiel Bread. If you like cold cuts, choose a brand that has few additives, such as Wegmans Just Turkey Turkey Breast or Applegate sliced turkey, chicken and roast beef. You could add spinach, tomatoes, onions, peppers and other veggies to your sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;- Dinner: If you like pasta for dinner, try upgrading from a white pasta to a whole-wheat pasta or legume pasta made from chickpeas or edamame. These pastas contain large amounts of fiber and protein. For the sauce, add as many veggies as you can, even if it’s a store-bought pasta sauce. “When my husband makes pasta, he adds a bunch of vegetables to the sauce that he gets from the store - mushrooms, carrots, onions, peppers,” Corbin said. “You don’t even know that they’re there. Hide the vegetables in wherever you can.” Serve your pasta with the least-processed source of protein you can find, such as a lean cut of meat, grilled fish, tofu or tempeh, Corbin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;- Snacks: If you like potato chips as a snack, upgrade to something that tastes similar but is higher in fiber and better for you, such as Terra vegetable chips or crackers made from whole grains and almond flour. Some other good options are nuts, trail mix and minimally processed snack bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Corbin emphasized that it’s also important to be a realist. If you can eat healthy meals most of the time, that’s great. But it’s also fine to treat yourself. “I don’t eat perfectly,” she said. “I try to make the best choices that I can. But I also know that one terrible day of eating is not going to mess up your whole life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:33:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNNi1qMkx2QzlkZzNWZmtBYjFfQ1BvWTZhX0xhZFJ5UldHQmIxUmRGM2hQTFpwNThBNnlwNzRLNHZzQWtnejRON2N3NU44dks1c29qQXp6b1htVGdSWGFzSXItYkRjYzdWdlVkN0w5eFJ6Nm94M0lBQ0dEdHU1dXpVN0M5LUxjb3kwLWN3ZEFyaGJSeDBDb2pPQlhhenpXX3dYUDZId3NBSDBJTFlWc2NGWTdOS3Jxdy1LZERGVlR6SnBXMlZ3bGhpNzZn</guid></item><item><title>公共卫生专家担心拆分MMR疫苗的建议。医生解释原因- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/health/mmr-vaccine-split-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — better known as the MMR shot —should be split into three separate vaccines, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Acting Director &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1975208317850116544" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O’Neill said&lt;/a&gt; this week. His post on X included similar language &lt;a href="https://x.com/TrumpTruthOnX/status/1971588655669297173" target="_blank"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt; by President Donald Trump in late September.

            This proposal has raised alarms for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/health/mmr-shots-acting-cdc-director"&gt;many public health experts&lt;/a&gt;, who worry that splitting up the shots has no clear scientific justification but would increase the number of health care visits required to get vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella; reduce access to the vaccines; and lead to lower vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Since the MMR combination vaccine shot has been approved in the US since 1971, I wanted to understand more about the diseases the MMR vaccine was designed to prevent and what are advantages and disadvantages of separated shots? Importantly, what could happen if vaccination rates fall, and who would be at highest risk?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Many Americans may not have had personal experience with measles, mumps or rubella. What are these diseases and what complications are they associated with?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;All three are contagious viruses that, until the development of vaccines, caused serious illness and sometimes death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Before the introduction of the measles vaccine, every year, measles led to an estimated 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths, primarily among children, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-srinivasan-mmrv-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mumps&lt;/a&gt; can cause &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534785/#:~:text=Mumps%20infection%20typically%20presents%20with,%2C%20encephalitis%2C%20and%20aseptic%20meningitis." target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; include brain swelling, testicular inflammation, infertility and deafness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Rubella can harm the developing baby if a woman acquires the infection during pregnancy. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;increases the risk of&lt;/a&gt; miscarriage and stillbirth. Babies born with congenital rubella syndrome can have serious birth defects including heart, liver and spleen damage, loss of hearing and eyesight and lifelong intellectual disability. According to the CDC, during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-srinivasan-mmrv-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;last major rubella epidemic&lt;/a&gt; in the US, in 1964-65, 11,000 pregnant women lost their babies. More than 2,000 newborns died. About 20,000 were born with congenital rubella syndrome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why was a combination vaccine developed against all three viruses?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00113b6nnqjxlrl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The MMR vaccine was developed to protect against measles, mumps and rubella with a single injection rather than three separate shots. Combining these vaccines streamlines the childhood immunization schedule, reduces the number of doctor visits and needle sticks, and helps ensure that children receive full protection on time. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, one at 12 to 15 months and another at 4 to 6 years old. If they had to have to separate shots, they would require 6 shots instead of 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00123b6nya6fv9w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The combined vaccine has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;extensively studied&lt;/a&gt; and consistently shown to provoke an immune response comparable to what’s seen when the individual vaccines are given separately, and without raising the risk of serious side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00133b6n60gp8j99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; In theory, separating the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines could allow for more flexibility if a family had a specific reason to delay or skip one of the components. Some parents also believe that spreading out shots might reduce the likelihood of side effects such as fever or mild rash, although research has not shown differences in side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00153b6ni7ilhnhh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In practice, separating the vaccines has several drawbacks. It requires multiple clinic visits and more injections, which increases the chance that one or more doses will be delayed or missed. That delay leaves children unprotected for longer periods of time against highly contagious diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz00163b6njp9nwcyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Furthermore, there is no evidence that the separate vaccines are safer or more effective than the combined MMR shot, and changing the current vaccine schedule adds unnecessary complexity for families and providers. For these reasons, health authorities—including the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC itself&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/measles/measles-vaccine/?srsltid=AfmBOoqKEvCLFVho-FvbyXxMRAHzb8RaPeLe7SXy5KcfUr863FAT_WYg" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;—recommend the combined MMR vaccine as the standard approach for immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; No, separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella are not currently available in the US. Only the combined MMR vaccine is approved and in use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The acting CDC director, Jim O’Neill, has asked manufacturers to begin developing individual vaccines for each virus, but that process will take years. Producing new versions of these vaccines requires not only manufacturing but also rigorous clinical testing to confirm their safety and effectiveness. This will be very challenging when these diseases are now rare thanks to widespread immunization. After that, the vaccines must still go through the full review by the US Food and Drug Administration before they can be offered to the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many public health experts have questioned the motivation behind this push, noting that the existing MMR vaccine is safe, effective and well-established, and there is no scientific justification for calling for separate shots. Some worry that this proposal could further fuel vaccine hesitancy by reinforcing unfounded fears about combination vaccines and ultimately leading to fewer children receiving timely protection against serious diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What could happen if vaccination rates fall, and who would be at highest risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001c3b6nb8r8gwd3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;If vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella decline, these diseases can quickly return. When community immunity drops, outbreaks become more frequent and can spread rapidly through schools, households, and entire regions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001d3b6nwayej1dv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is what has already happened in the US, where vaccination rates have already been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;falling.&lt;/a&gt; In 2025, there have already been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,544&lt;/a&gt; confirmed measles cases. This is the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;highest number&lt;/a&gt; since measles was declared eliminated 25 years ago.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001e3b6nxtsc46j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those most at risk include newborns, who are too young to be vaccinated and among the most medically fragile. People with weakened immune systems are also highly vulnerable. This group includes patients undergoing cancer treatment, transplant recipients and individuals taking immune-suppressing medications. They face a higher likelihood of severe illness if exposed to infections, and vaccines may not protect them as effectively, or may not be safe for them to receive, because their immune systems cannot generate a full response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001f3b6ndjo4vusg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Older adults are another group at increased risk. Age-related changes in immunity and chronic health conditions make them more prone to serious complications. In some cases, immunity from prior vaccination may have diminished over time, leaving them more susceptible if vaccine coverage falls and infections spread more widely.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggzxylz001g3b6nifh7q3eu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of community immunity depends on collective participation. When most people stay up to date on their vaccinations, it protects not only themselves but also those around them who are most vulnerable to severe disease and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The best medicines can come from unexpected places. Case in point: A new study published today finds that stevia—the natural sugar substitute—can potentially boost common hair loss treatments’ potency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in China and Australia developed a dissolving patch that combines a sweetener derived from the stevia plant (&lt;em&gt;Stevia rebaudiana&lt;/em&gt;) with topical minoxidil, the active ingredient in popular over-the-counter hair loss drugs like Rogaine. In tests with balding mice, the sweetened patch appeared to enhance minoxidil’s absorption into the skin and boosted its ability to restore hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This work opens exciting possibilities for more effective and user-friendly treatments for hair loss,” study author Lifeng Kang, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney’s School of Pharmacy, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The need for better hair loss treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Minoxidil is most commonly used to treat androgenetic alopecia, which is more commonly known as male or female pattern baldness. The condition is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24555-dht-dihydrotestosterone"&gt;primarily caused&lt;/a&gt; by having genes that make a person’s hair follicles overly sensitive to androgens (male-related sex hormones). Regular minoxidil use can slow or prevent further balding from androgenetic alopecia, but it has its drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The drug doesn’t dissolve easily in liquid nor is it &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ced.15338#:~:text=only%201.4%25%20of%20the%20active%20ingredient%20is%20systemically%20absorbed%20after%20topical%20application%20to%20the%20scalp"&gt;absorbed well&lt;/a&gt; into the body when applied topically, which means that it has to be applied &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to be effective (usually at least once or twice a day). Other commonly added compounds like ethanol and propylene glycol can improve the drug’s skin absorption, but they can also cause side effects, including itching, a rash, and dandruff build-up on your scalp.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A handful of studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11890238/"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that minimally invasive microneedling—causing tiny pricks in the skin—can improve minoxidil’s absorption and even boost hair growth on its own as a result of increasing blood flow to the hair follicles. For the new study, the researchers wondered if it were possible to develop a dissolvable patch that essentially performed microneedling and delivered minoxidil to a person’s scalp at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to Kang, other studies had also indicated that natural compounds similar to stevia, including the main sweetener in monk fruit, held specific properties they could use to develop the patch. They hypothesized that stevioside, the primary sweetener in stevia, could act as both the base for their microneedles as well as helping minoxidil dissolve better in water.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Early success&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their patch on mice given doses of testosterone to simulate androgenetic alopecia (the hormone doesn’t directly cause pattern baldness in people, but it breaks down into another hormone that does, dihydrotestosterone). They then compared these mice to animals that were given nothing, and mice that were given a standard formulation of minoxidil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mice that got the stevia patch experienced clear improvements in hair growth, the researchers found. By day 35, the patch-dosed mice saw hair return in about 67% of the treated area, compared to about 25% of the treated area in mice given standard minoxidil. As hoped, the researchers also found that the patch greatly improved the drug’s absorption into the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1002%2Fadhm.202503575%3Futm_source=muckrack%26utm_medium=email%26utm_campaign=publicity_wly%26utm_content=wrh_10_6_25%26utm_term=adhm/1/01000199b99bcb6e-928150eb-199e-405b-919c-d0d95b823a83-000000/rdJp0BJ15KO1kt6_c5_kXb6xQvs=446"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials, are still very preliminary, and more studies will be needed before the patch might make its way to humans, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While the mouse model results are promising, human hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Kang said. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But given these results, and the fact that stevia is already widely used as a food additive, Kang is hopeful that stevia could prove a safe and easy boost to minoxidil’s effectiveness. He and his team are now looking to explain why stevia boosts the drug’s potency and whether similar compounds could work as well. They are also hoping to run clinical trials in people with pattern baldness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The microneedle patch could simplify treatment regimens, reduce dosing frequency, and improve patient adherence,” Kang said.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Iron transports oxygen in your blood and supports cellular function. You may need to take iron supplements if you have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/low-iron-symptoms-11802492" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low iron levels&lt;/a&gt;.

The tannins and polyphenols in coffee can bind to iron, making it harder for your body to absorb. However, it’s important to remember that the effects of coffee on iron absorption seem to depend on when you drink your coffee.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee is a mild diuretic, which means it can increase urination and lead to a loss of certain nutrients. &lt;strong&gt;This may reduce the effectiveness of water-soluble vitamins&lt;/strong&gt; such as B vitamins (including B1, B6, B7, and B12) and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-benefits-of-vitamin-c-supplements-89083" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since the body doesn't store these vitamins, any extra is passed through your urine. Drinking a lot of coffee can accelerate this process, potentially reducing absorption. For this reason, you should try &lt;strong&gt;taking your vitamins and coffee at different times&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Vitamin D and Calcium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee may lower the absorption of both vitamin D and calcium: Research suggests that higher caffeine intake is associated with lower levels of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-benefits-11688450" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here's how coffee might interfere with your vitamin D and calcium supplements:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee may reduce vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt; by decreasing the number of receptors needed for absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D receptors are also vital for &lt;strong&gt;calcium absorption and bone health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee's diuretic effect may also &lt;strong&gt;increase the loss of calcium through urine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, this amount is small and may be offset by adding as little as 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk to your beverage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moderate coffee consumption may not have a significant adverse effect on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-increase-bone-density-11721928" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt;. However, people who are at risk for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/calcium-deficiency-symptoms-11733946" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low calcium levels&lt;/a&gt; or osteoporosis should be mindful. It's best to take your calcium or vitamin D supplement at a different time from when you drink coffee.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The polyphenols and tannins in coffee can bind to other essential minerals, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/zinc-and-magnesium-8751876" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium and zinc&lt;/a&gt;, reducing absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Coffee's diuretic effects can also increase nutrient loss through urine. &lt;strong&gt;Take your magnesium or zinc separately from coffee&lt;/strong&gt; for the best results.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the body that regulates your circadian rhythm. It is triggered by darkness at night. It's also available as an over-the-counter (OTC) supplement used to improve sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a stimulant, &lt;strong&gt;coffee works against melatonin&lt;/strong&gt; by keeping you alert and making it hard to fall asleep, especially when consumed close to bedtime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To avoid interfering with melatonin, it's best to &lt;strong&gt;separate coffee and melatonin intake by several hours&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally, it is recommended to &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-should-you-wait-between-caffeine-and-bedtime-3014980" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avoid caffeine&lt;/a&gt; for at least six hours before bedtime.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The key to avoiding an interaction between coffee and your supplements is the timing. It's recommended to take your daily vitamin or supplement separately from your cup of coffee, ideally at least a few hours. This way, you can minimize any potential interaction and ensure optimal absorption.

        &lt;p&gt;Scientists on Tuesday reported that they had reversed &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/knowing-your-alzheimers-risk-might-change-your-habits-and-not-for-the-better-2000598318"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; in mice, a feat that offers hope of a potential cure for the devastating form of dementia in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a paper published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02426-1"&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a team of researchers describe how, by harnessing the brain’s garbage disposal system, they managed to repair the brain and reverse the progress of the disease in the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, they used nanotechnology to target and restore the brain’s “vascular gatekeeper,” the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from toxins and streamlines blood flow in and out of the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maintenance work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new method came from studying how the buildup of “waste” proteins such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) impairs neuron function. Sometimes, clever solutions to complex problems come from going back to the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Typically, the blood-brain barrier filters out unwanted substances from the brain, but in people with Alzheimer’s, the barrier gets clogged or fails to respond properly to intruders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as Aβ accumulate, disease progresses,” Giuseppe Battaglia, study senior author and a neuroscientist at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, said in a &lt;a href="https://ibecbarcelona.eu/consiguen-revertir-el-alzheimer-en-ratones-con-el-uso-de-nanoparticulas"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“But once the vasculature is able to function again,” Battaglia said, “it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How they did it&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Battaglia and his team developed nanoparticles that mimicked a protein called LRP1, a molecule typically responsible for reacting to toxins in the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers genetically engineered mice to produce more amyloid-beta proteins and to show significant cognitive decline similar to Alzheimer’s. Each mouse received three injections of the new drug, and the researchers observed changes in their behavior and brain activity for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The results were impressive. A 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to a 60 year-old human) that received treatment, when reassessed at 18 months (90 year-old human) old, had “recovered the behavior of a healthy mouse,” the scientists found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels,” Battaglia said. Surprisingly, the treatment took just three injections for it to reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s in mice, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As with all mice studies, it will take much more work before this treatment could be tested for use in humans. But the results suggest that the approach, which essentially coaxes the brain to return to a healthy state, could hold promise for this incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Individuals who are more prone to disgust are more likely to report symptoms. This is not equivalent to general sensitivity (via &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257409" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While trypophobia shares traits with phobias, it often lacks the distress or life impact required for diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5811467/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; notes that many report symptoms similar to specific phobias without meeting all clinical criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without official recognition, people still report genuine anxiety and revulsion. Roughly &lt;strong&gt;10 to 18 percent&lt;/strong&gt; of the population feels some discomfort. Though trypophobia isn’t listed in &lt;strong&gt;DSM-5/DSM-5-TR&lt;/strong&gt;, it continues to be studied (via &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/is-trypophobia-real/769CD2A75D15763730AC524A433BB601" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;BJPsych Open&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916311783" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/a&gt; finds that mild discomfort is a common experience. But by itself, it doesn’t qualify as a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why These Patterns Trigger the Brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Why does the brain react so strongly to clustered holes or bumps? Although research is still in development, scientists believe that trypophobia stems from a combination of evolved instincts, visual sensitivities, and learned associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation is the &lt;strong&gt;spectral or visual pattern theory&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1467608/full" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/a&gt; explains that specific visual properties, such as mid-range spatial frequencies and high contrast, place unusual demands on the visual system. These patterns may be complex for the brain to process.

&lt;p&gt;Some cravings are hard to ignore, but one man had a hankering for some gummy cola bottles that just wouldn’t quit. After inhaling an entire 3kg (6.6 pounds) bag of Haribo gummies in just three days, 33-year-old Nathan Rimington found himself in the ER. What started as a harmless sweet-tooth binge quickly turned into a medical nightmare, leaving the UK truck driver drenched in sweat, with a bloated stomach and severe abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Rimington, based in Yorkshire, ordered the 3kg bulk bag of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/tag/gummies/"&gt;gummy candies&lt;/a&gt; online for £18 (about $22). He thought it was a steal—I mean, who wouldn’t want nearly 7 pounds of cola-flavored treats? But by the third day, his indulgence had consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-73109351" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-73109351" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“The next day my stomach was in absolute agony,” he said, reported by &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/man-orders-3kg-haribo-amazon-32590838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manchester Evening News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “By Wednesday, I couldn’t even get out of bed. I was sweating; it was awful.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;His symptoms sent him straight to the hospital, where doctors found Rimington’s blood pressure was off the charts, and his stomach pain showed no signs of letting up. Initial thoughts were food poisoning, but when tests revealed high levels of gelatin in his system, the cause became clear—he had overdosed on the very ingredient that makes gummy candies chewy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-14549365" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-14549365" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Gelatin, the backbone of most gummy treats, is a common culprit in diverticulitis, a condition in which small pouches form in the colon and become infected. Rimington’s extreme consumption triggered a painful flare-up of this condition, and doctors quickly treated him with IV fluids and pain management. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It was my own stupid fault,” he said after the diagnosis, noting that he’d never expected his candy cravings to spiral into a hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-30841715" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-30841715" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTE5IGFpLWxpc3QtYmxvY2staXAnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgoKPGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nYWktZHluYW1pYyBhaS1pcC1kYXRhJyAgY291bnRyaWVzPSdERScgY291bnRyeS1saXN0PSdXJyBkYXRhLWNvZGU9J1BHUnBkaUJqYkdGemN6MG5iRzVuZEdRdFpIbHVZVzFwWXkxcGJtRnlkR2xqYkdVbklITjBlV3hsUFNKdGFXNHRhR1ZwWjJoME9qTXdNSEI0T3lCaGJHbG5iaTFwZEdWdGN6b2dZMlZ1ZEdWeU95QnFkWE4wYVdaNUxXTnZiblJsYm5RNklHTmxiblJsY2pzZ1pHbHpjR3hoZVRvZ1pteGxlRHNpUGp3dlpHbDJQZz09Jz48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Even after the dust settled, Rimington couldn’t escape the trauma. “On my birthday, my best mate bought me a 3kg bag of cola bottles as a joke. It’s like PTSD now,” he joked. “I see a cola bottle and think I’m going to end up in A&amp;amp;E (the ER).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a cautionary tale for us all. Indulging in a bag of gummies now and then is fine, but too much—especially sugar and gelatin—can do serious damage. Rimington’s advice to others? “Just do it in moderation. Don’t go full blast and buy kilos of it at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-20695667" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-20695667" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 3D-DNA blood test (EpiSwitch CFS) identified ME/CFS with about 96% accuracy in a small validation study.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The strongest signals involve IL-2 and other immune-signaling pathways, hinting at biological subtypes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The test builds on an existing lab platform used for cancer diagnostics but remains experimental.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Larger, multi-center studies and independent replication are needed before clinical adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORWICH, England —&lt;/strong&gt; After years of being told their crushing exhaustion might be “all in their head,” people with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome may finally have something they’ve desperately needed: a blood test that proves their illness is real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of East Anglia have developed a test that correctly identifies the condition 96% of the time in severely affected patients. In a study of 24 bedridden or housebound ME/CFS patients and 45 healthy people, the test spotted the illness in 92% of cases while correctly ruling it out in 98% of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthy-lifestyle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-025-07203-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which, importantly, was funded by Oxford BioDynamics, appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Translational Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the millions living with ME/CFS, getting diagnosed &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/promising-blood-test-for-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has been a nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Patients often spend years visiting doctor after doctor, only to be dismissed or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/two-in-five-have-misdiagnosed-themselves-with-serious-disease-after-googling-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. Without a lab test to point to, they’ve had to rely on doctors believing their symptoms: debilitating fatigue that lasts months, feeling worse after any physical or mental effort, brain fog, and sleep that doesn’t refresh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“ME/CFS lacks definitive diagnostic biomarkers, complicating diagnosis and management,” the researchers wrote — a clinical way of saying doctors have had no objective way to confirm what patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Testing for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome could finally be on the horizone. (Image created by StudyFinds with AI (OpenAI, 2025))&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-this-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-test-different"&gt;What Makes This Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Test Different&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test, called EpiSwitch CFS, doesn’t look at genes themselves. Instead, it examines how DNA is folded and organized inside blood cells. When DNA folds in certain ways, it turns genes on or off. In people with ME/CFS, these folding patterns create a unique signature that shows up in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the UK examined blood from 47 severely ill ME/CFS patients and 61 healthy people. Using a chip that can scan a million different spots across all the DNA, computer algorithms helped them identify 200 specific patterns that could distinguish patients from healthy people. The patterns were then tested on a separate group to confirm accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s striking is that these patterns weren’t clustered in one area. They appeared across the entire genetic landscape, suggesting the illness affects how the body regulates itself at a fundamental level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-immune-system-connection"&gt;The Immune System Connection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those 200 markers pointed researchers toward genes involved in fighting infections and controlling inflammation. They found heightened activity in immune signaling molecules—basically, the chemical messengers cells use to coordinate a response to threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One molecule called interleukin-2 kept showing up. It helps organize the immune system’s attack on &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/washing-hands-20-seconds-cleans-viruses-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;viruses and bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. The test also detected increased activity in systems that sense infection and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sugar-inflammation-autoimmune-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trigger inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This aligns with what patients have reported for decades: many developed ME/CFS after a bad virus. However, the study cannot determine whether these immune changes caused the illness or occurred as a result of it. It’s a crucial question that needs more research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined only those immune markers, patients fell into two distinct groups. Approximately 60% exhibited one pattern, while 40% showed another. This suggests there might be different types of ME/CFS, which could explain why some patients improve with certain approaches while others don’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team compared these immune patterns to those affected by medications like rituximab (which targets immune cells) and glatiramer acetate (used for multiple sclerosis). They found overlap, particularly with that interleukin-2 molecule. However, there’s an important caveat: while an early trial of rituximab showed promise, a larger, more rigorous study found that it didn’t benefit ME/CFS patients overall. The overlap doesn’t mean these drugs are effective; it may help identify which patient subgroups to study in future trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-could-the-blood-test-work-in-clinics"&gt;Could The Blood Test Work in Clinics?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other research groups have tried to develop ME/CFS blood tests, with accuracy ranging from 79% to 95%. The problem? Most required expensive specialty equipment or complicated procedures that wouldn’t work in a regular doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This test has an advantage: the same technology already runs in commercial labs. The company behind it uses the platform for a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/prostate-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; test (94% accurate) and a test predicting &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; responses (85% accurate). Both are available in U.S. and UK clinics with insurance coverage. The ME/CFS version is still experimental.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test needs only a standard blood draw and uses equipment many labs already have. If validated, it could potentially reach community hospitals, not just research centers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-blood-test-the-reality-check"&gt;Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Blood Test: The Reality Check&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study only looked at people who were severely ill, meaning either bedridden or housebound. We don’t know if it works for those with milder symptoms who can still work or go to school, even if they struggle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both the initial study group and the validation group were drawn from the same collection of stored blood samples, which may affect the generalizability of the results to patients outside of this study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also haven’t tested actual patient samples to see if the markers can distinguish ME/CFS from other illnesses with similar symptoms, like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/multiple-sclerosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/rheumatoid-arthritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Their computational analysis showed the conditions share some immune pathway patterns, so the test might need fine-tuning to tell them apart reliably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before this reaches doctors’ offices, it needs testing in larger, more diverse groups of patients across multiple medical centers. And there’s the aforementioned conflict of interest: the research was paid by Oxford BioDynamics — and several authors work for the company. Independent scientists need to verify these results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-patients"&gt;What This Means for Patients&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For someone who’s been sick for years and told repeatedly &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/medical-gaslighting-can-wreck-patients-health-for-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;that nothing is wrong&lt;/a&gt;, a positive blood test would be validation. Not just for peace of mind, but for disability claims, for family members who doubted them, for employers who thought they were faking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond diagnosis, identifying specific &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/immune-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune problems&lt;/a&gt; opens possibilities for treatments tailored to what’s actually going wrong in each person’s body, not just throwing random solutions at symptoms and hoping something sticks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research is early, and the path is long to widespread use for people who are concerned they’re suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. But for a condition that’s left millions invisible to medicine, having something concrete to point to on a lab report would be progress once thought impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected whole blood samples from 47 patients with severe ME/CFS (average age 45, predominantly female) and 61 healthy people of similar ages. They analyzed DNA folding patterns using a chip that examines about one million spots where DNA might interact with itself in three-dimensional space. They split samples into training (80%) and testing (20%) groups. Statistical analysis identified markers that differed between patients and healthy people. Machine learning selected 200 markers that best predicted diagnosis. A separate group of 24 ME/CFS patients and 45 healthy people tested the model’s accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 200-marker model correctly identified ME/CFS with 92% sensitivity and ruled it out with 98% specificity, achieving 96% overall accuracy in the independent test group. Markers appeared across multiple chromosomes rather than clustering in one spot, suggesting widespread regulation problems. Analysis revealed these markers related to immune signaling, particularly interleukin-2, inflammatory molecules, infection sensors, and immune response pathways. When examined for interleukin-2 patterns specifically, patients separated into two groups (18 of 29 in one cluster), suggesting different disease subtypes. Some immune patterns overlapped with pathways affected by certain medications, though these drugs haven’t proven effective for ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study included only severely ill, housebound patients—results may not apply to those with moderate or mild illness. Training and testing samples came from the same blood bank collections. The test hasn’t been compared against actual patient samples from other inflammatory conditions to confirm it’s specific to ME/CFS. Researchers didn’t have information about patients’ infection histories or other health issues. The study shows association between markers and disease but can’t prove the immune changes cause ME/CFS. Sample sizes were modest (47 patients, 61 healthy people for initial analysis; 24 patients, 45 healthy people for validation). Larger studies across multiple locations with diverse patients are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that adults who experienced trauma in childhood showed a consistent pattern of changes in their blood chemistry. These changes were observed even decades later and seemed to intensify with the severity of the trauma. The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.03.018" target="_blank"&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest a biological link between early-life adversity and increased risk for physical and mental health conditions later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team focused on the metabolome, which refers to the complete set of small molecules in the body known as metabolites. These include sugars, amino acids, lipids, and other chemical compounds that are produced as the body digests food, processes medications, or carries out routine functions such as repairing tissues or managing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, metabolites are the chemical fingerprints of all the biological processes happening in the body at a given time. They provide a snapshot of how the body is functioning — or malfunctioning — at the molecular level. Because they reflect real-time changes in the body’s internal state, metabolite levels can offer early clues about disease risk, inflammation, nutrient imbalances, and stress-related disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying the metabolome provides a way to understand how life experiences, including trauma, influence long-term health at the molecular level. Previous studies have shown that childhood trauma is linked to an increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, and mental illnesses such as depression. Although psychological and behavioral explanations exist, biological changes might also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, earlier research in this area was limited in scope, often involving small groups of people and focusing on only a few types of trauma or specific metabolites. The current study aimed to address these limitations by analyzing a wide range of metabolites in a large sample of adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from nearly 3,000 adults who were part of a long-term health study in the Netherlands. Participants gave blood samples at two time points: once at the beginning of the study and again six years later. These samples were analyzed using a method that screened for over 800 metabolites in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood trauma was assessed through interviews, which asked participants whether they had experienced emotional, physical, or sexual abuse or emotional neglect before the age of 16. Each participant received a score based on how many types of trauma they had experienced and how often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found 18 metabolites that were significantly associated with childhood trauma. Nine were found at higher levels in individuals with trauma histories, and nine were found at lower levels. These differences tended to be larger in people who had experienced more severe trauma, suggesting a dose-response relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the metabolites that were elevated included compounds involved in the breakdown of fatty acids and certain amino acids. These compounds—such as 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine—play a role in how the body generates energy and processes nutrients. Their increased levels may indicate changes in how the body handles fats and proteins, possibly hinting at mitochondrial inefficiency or other forms of metabolic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other altered metabolites were related to the body’s stress system. Cortisol and cortisone, two hormones released by the adrenal glands during stress, were found at lower levels in individuals with childhood trauma. These hormones are part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a system that helps regulate how the body responds to stress. Lower levels might reflect long-term changes in this system, which could contribute to physical and emotional health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the metabolites identified—such as stachydrine and 1-stearoyl-GPC—have previously been linked to conditions like cardiovascular disease or depression. But six of the 18 metabolites associated with childhood trauma had no clear links to depression in this study, suggesting that trauma may affect the body in ways that are not entirely explained by mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To check the reliability of their findings, the researchers repeated the analysis using a different trauma questionnaire given to the same participants four years later. They also looked at a separate group of 308 people who were related to the original participants. The results remained consistent, especially within the same group over time, though the replication in the second group was somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined whether the observed metabolic changes might simply be due to related health behaviors or conditions, such as body weight or use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. When they adjusted for these factors, the results remained largely the same, suggesting the effects were not merely due to these other health-related variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers compared the metabolomic signature of childhood trauma to the one associated with depression. While there was some overlap, many of the trauma-related changes were stronger or unique. This suggests that the biological effects of childhood trauma are not just a reflection of depression but may involve distinct pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study had many strengths—including a large sample size, long-term follow-up, and replication using multiple methods—it also had some limitations. Most participants were of North-European descent, which limits how well the findings apply to other populations. In addition, the study grouped different types of trauma into a single score, which may have obscured whether specific types of trauma affect the metabolome in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not account for dietary habits, which are known to influence metabolite levels and could differ between people with and without trauma histories. Since trauma can affect eating behaviors, this might have played a role in the observed differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study excluded individuals with psychiatric conditions other than depression or anxiety, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Since PTSD has been linked to metabolic dysfunction in other research, future studies might explore how it interacts with childhood trauma to affect the metabolome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings provide evidence that early-life trauma leaves a lasting imprint on the body’s metabolism. The affected metabolites appear to involve energy production, fat and protein processing, and stress hormone regulation. These biological changes may help explain why people who experience childhood trauma are more likely to develop a range of health problems later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore whether these metabolite patterns can help identify individuals at risk for disease, and whether interventions—such as diet, exercise, or stress management—might reverse or reduce the biological effects of trauma. Understanding the long-term impact of childhood adversity on the metabolome could open new doors for prevention and treatment strategies targeting both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.03.018" target="_blank"&gt;The Metabolomic Signature of Childhood Trauma&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Camille Souama, Femke Lamers, Yuri Milaneschi, Rick Jansen, Christiaan H.

Since the virus causes excessive diarrhea and vomiting, it can lead to severe dehydration, especially in young children and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HMAV2QDDZVCO3P273LV2H7AYBQ"&gt;Each year in the U.S., norovirus causes an average of 900 deaths, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZGGE2T3HRJFR7K5GOMJLSIBOTE"&gt;“It’s a simple illness, but if you live in a household where there are immunocompromised persons, then it’s something to really be aware of, to help protect that compromised individual,” said Hagmann. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SDXAE6W5PVBORNWWTIOFQT2UJE"&gt;If a person becomes so sick that they refuse food and water, Hagmann said it might be time to see a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;How can you prevent it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AKG5X6BFRBEKNIKJZMXDOXQ4O4"&gt;Good handwashing is key, especially since alcohol-based hand sanitizer doesn’t work well against the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PL26FUJAPBD45GIEXQ6PQKZDW4"&gt;Hagmann also recommends disinfecting shared spaces with a chlorine bleach solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UETGUJ7SNNBHTEFTCHBTYEG6FI"&gt;“It’s likely to survive in the environment unless you’re very careful to clean with bleach, because it’s very hearty, the virus,” said Hagmann. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:MWZINKU62FEHPIKM3VMOUGY5XQ" data-fusion-component="MWZINKU62FEHPIKM3VMOUGY5XQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:MWZINKU62FEHPIKM3VMOUGY5XQ" data-fusion-component="MWZINKU62FEHPIKM3VMOUGY5XQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--center skimlinks"&gt;If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.&lt;span&gt; By using this site, you consent to our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/user-agreement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;User Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Privacy Policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NJ.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOZ21YSVZ0Wm1valdfbzg1V200OF9HQzctbmpGS2oxSHFpM3g3b3BrLTI0VmlvY2ZFdzNxdDVFQWJDR09ReGg5cWY2b2hudXZhSGRBODQwcmh6eW1yYmtjSlhuNXFaNUNTdm1LdGZFTVo1dC1jU1dxVzJIeUpXdW9Lay10WGtkVnY2SE80SEllTTVtbGdONHlZ0gGrAUFVX3lxTE94SFBETUt3UFMycDExTlFrVkw5ekJwbmh0Y3ZzX0pPd2lzLTVDenphSWlodzVfUk9scGlzT2RwXzFLT3luVkdwOGx6N0V4LXFPTHFHcGtmX2NHX1d0UnU0OXJLVFpXb0FtVi1lN1VId2xoQ1ZST2I2MTRFV2pOOG9iamRYMDVqbE5OcWFZUl8xMjJiaUVsakpDMkFlc2FQZUgxcE1SZDlOdTVMVQ</guid></item><item><title>33岁的商人在三天内吃了6磅Haribo可乐瓶后住院： “这绝对是痛苦的” -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15172979/man-6lbs-haribo-cola-bottles-agony.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A businessman ended up in hospital for nearly a week after gorging on a 6.6lb bag of Haribo cola bottles left him with agonising stomach cramps and dangerously high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nathan Rimmington, 33, from South Yorkshire, ordered the bulk £18 bag to satisfy a late-night craving—but finished the entire thing in just three nights, consuming an estimated 10,461 calories in sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few days later, the HGV business owner collapsed in agony at home, suffering intense stomach pain and wild swings in body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought it might have been the Sunday roast I'd eaten a few days after finishing the sweets,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But my stomach was in absolute agony. By Wednesday I couldn't even get out of bed—I was sweating, it was awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went to the doctor, but I was literally lying on the floor in the waiting room because the pain was so bad.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed Mr Rimmington's blood pressure was alarmingly high, and he was rushed to Rotherham Hospital — where doctors discovered the real, and rather unusual, cause of his suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They asked me what I'd eaten and all I could think of was the Sunday dinner, so they put it down to food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.0" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/09/25/SignUpModule_Image_Health.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nathan bought the 3kg bag of sweets from Amazon to satisfy his cravings, despite not usually having a sweet tooth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then they said "you've got loads of gelatine in your system, do you eat a lot of sweets?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said I'd had some cola bottles, they asked me how many and I said three kilos. I didn't think that was bad'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were laughing and joking about it with me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rimmington was then diagnosed with acute diverticulitis — a condition that affects the large intestine, causing abdominal pain, high temperature and even rectal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's caused by small bulges or pouches in the walls of the intestine called diverticula — though according to the NHS most people will not get symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common treatment includes antibiotics, if the diverticulitis is caused by an infection and painkillers such as paracetamol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rarely, diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as a blockage in the bowel, a build-up of pus in the bowel, fistula and bowel perforation—which can cause a severe infection called peritonitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Mr Rimmington's case, doctors were able to treat his condition through administering antibiotics and fluid intravenously through a drip, negating the need for surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Just over a week later, Nathan ended up in hospital with agonising stomach cramps, a high temperature and sweats &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He said he thought 3kg for £18 was a good deal, not knowing the horrendous pain his binge would cause &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the six days he was in hospital, Mr Rimmington was nil-by-mouth, meaning that he was not allowed to have any food, drink or medication by mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year on Mr Rimmington hasn't eaten a cola bottle since, knowing now that everything's better in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It was my own stupid fault and I haven't eaten a cola bottle since,' he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It's like PTSD, I see a cola bottle now and think I'm going to end up in A&amp;amp;E. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'My advice to avoid the same thing happening to anyone else would be just do it in moderation, don't go full blase and get kilos at a time like me.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Haribo has been contacted for comment.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;His ordeal comes as the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15151137/Buy-one-one-free-junk-food-deals-banned.html"&gt;Government bans price-slashing deals on junk food&lt;/a&gt;, as part of its long-delayed crackdown on obesity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Buy one get free' offers on sweets, crips, sugary drinks and other snacks were banned from October 1, alongside free refills of fizzy drinks in restaurants and cafes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt; The rules apply to supermarkets, bigger high street shops and online retailers, and come after years of delays amid the cost-of-living crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ministers insist the measures are a crucial step in tackling obesity—particularly among children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It will be followed in January by a ban on online adverts for unhealthy food and drink, and restrictions on TV advertising before 9pm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar restrictions are due in Wales next year, with Scotland expected to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The policy was first announced by Boris Johnson in 2021 as part of a UK-wide strategy — but has been watered down and delayed repeatedly, with ministers blaming the cost-of-living crisis for giving the food industry more time to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Valerie Brickey went to three pharmacies and her regular pediatrician in late September in an effort to find a Covid-19 vaccine for her 16-year-old granddaughter, Ryleigh.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml00042e6e11m5fjzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Brickey and her granddaughter, who live together in a small apartment near Durham, North Carolina, have health problems that make them more vulnerable to severe Covid symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml00052e6ec0se6cvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brickey keeps an eye on Covid levels in wastewater and knew that rising numbers in the area were putting them both in harm’s way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml00062e6egc8ln39c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But their hunt for an updated vaccine for Ryleigh has been fruitless.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggvi29000013b6qvw3r6zr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like millions of kids in the United States who are covered by Medicaid, Ryleigh is eligible for free vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children, or VFC, program. It’s normally so seamless to use that Brickey wasn’t even aware they’d benefited from it. She just wasn’t charged for Ryleigh’s seasonal vaccines when she got them at her pediatrician’s office.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml00072e6eh11qe68w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, however, Covid-19 vaccines haven’t been available through the Vaccines for Children program; their doctor told Brickey she had not planned to carry any Covid vaccines, which can be tricky to store.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml00082e6eb8sbwjoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Local pharmacies told her Ryleigh could get one only if she shelled out $368 for the shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml00092e6ewtem01lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I could afford $368, she wouldn’t be on Medicaid,” Brickey said. “Hello?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000a2e6eacqulrpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In North Carolina and other states, low-income families who normally get no-cost Covid-19 vaccines for their kids have been told those shots aren’t available because states have been unable to order Covid-19 vaccines through the VFC program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000b2e6eg2cjeujk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They were required to wait for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to formally &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/health/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; this year’s Covid vaccine for the VFC program, which it finally announced Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000c2e6ew9ibjhlq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those recommendations say anyone over the age of 6 months can get a Covid vaccine after a discussion about its risks and benefits with a qualified health care provider, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists — a stipulation known as shared decision-making.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000d2e6e4b1plcqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, the multistep process for making those recommendations was disrupted when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, abruptly removed all 17 members of the CDC’s independent vaccine advisory panel&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in June and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/cdc-acip-new-members"&gt;replaced them&lt;/a&gt; with his own picks, some of whom have said the mRNA Covid vaccines are dangerous and should be taken off the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000e2e6ek3kgo0gn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was supposed to vote on recommendations for Covid-19 vaccines at its June meeting, but those votes instead took place in mid-September to give the new members time to get up to speed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000f2e6erkngu8xc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spate of high-profile resignations at the CDC over Kennedy’s vaccine policies — coupled with the firing of his newly installed CDC director, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/health/cdc-director-monarez"&gt;Dr. Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; — in August, compounded the uncertainty about when or even if the VFC shots would be available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000g2e6ek0i1tg3u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result, states were notified only this week that they could finally place orders for Covid vaccines for kids through the Vaccines for Children program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000h2e6ee3bxqx9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, the CDC had recommended Covid vaccines for the 2024-25 respiratory virus season and for the VFC by June.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000i2e6eagmn7d2y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children who use VFC have been deprived the updated vaccine for weeks while we have been waiting for a signature,” Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as the head of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, wrote Monday in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1975275742834385031" target="_blank"&gt;post on social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“That means privately insured kids had access while un- or underinsured kids did not. This is your new CDC.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000j2e6eymu8y6cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ryleigh has a nerve disorder that causes seizures as well as a condition that affects her body’s ability to regulate her blood pressure: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS, which causes dizziness, headaches, nausea and a racing heart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000k2e6e017tfsrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She’s on heart medication, and you don’t need to put any more stressors on your body when you’re dealing with POTS,” Brickey said of why she was eager to get her granddaughter vaccinated against Covid. “She misses a lot of school already. I don’t want to add another thing onto this kid. She’s got enough.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000m2e6es8dj1spy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s another reason Brickey is eager to find a vaccine for Ryleigh: She’s Ryleigh’s primary caregiver and has diabetes, which may make her more susceptible to severe illness. Her granddaughter could bring the virus home from school, and she worries what could happen to Ryleigh if Brickey&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;got sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000n2e6erv2vhupm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two years ago, a serious bout of sepsis hospitalized Brickey for a month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000o2e6evm7oegak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My system has not quite come back all the way,” she said. “I had to learn how to walk and everything all over again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000p2e6elmoj1uxl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because of her age and preexisting condition, Brickey said, she didn’t have a problem getting a vaccine for herself, but she knows it doesn’t make either of them bulletproof. They both need to be protected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Ryleigh’s health care is covered through North Carolina’s Medicaid program. The VFC program serves kids on Medicaid as well as those who are uninsured or underinsured. In 2023, the latest year of data available, the VFC delivered 74 million vaccines to participating health care providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It’s impossible to know how many kids have been denied Covid vaccines this fall while waiting for the CDC to act.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Daskalakis said the delay in recommending the shots for adults meant missing “over 35 million opportunities for co-administration” of flu and Covid shots in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            According to Ryleigh’s vaccination records, which were reviewed by CNN, she got a flu vaccine September 28 at a local Walgreens. But Brickey says they were told there were no Covid vaccines available unless they wanted to pay out of pocket.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000u2e6ebzacelu3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brickey called Ryleigh’s pediatrician&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;again Monday and was told the office still can’t order vaccines from the VFC program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgh11zog00002e6etybl0qhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said in a written statement on Wednesday that it was also working to resolve access problems after CDC’s signoff on Covid-19 vaccine recommendations. Most people should be able to get them without paying out of pocket, it said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “NC Medicaid and most private insurers will continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines at little or no cost. Vaccines for Children (VFC) program providers may be delayed in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine this year because they had to wait for CDC approval before they could order supply,” the statement said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Several other state health departments contacted by CNN – including South Carolina, Hawaii and Utah – said they have begun the process of notifying their VFC providers that they can now order Covid vaccines for kids. After orders are placed, they said, it would take about two weeks for the shots to reach doctors offices or pharmacies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000w2e6epo1rdr7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Association of Immunization Managers, a national umbrella organization for state vaccination programs, shared similar information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “CDC contracts are in effect, and states can now order pediatrics Covid vaccines for the Vaccines for Children program,” Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and the group’s chief medical officer, said Monday. “If an order is placed today, they would hopefully have vaccines by the end of the week.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml000y2e6elck4yjtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although Covid vaccines may soon become available for low-income kids, the chaos and delays behind this year’s rollout means they may still be hard to find.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Not all locations may have all the vaccines that are recommended for you or your child – this may be especially true for Covid vaccines right now,” Charla Hayley, director of communications for the Utah Department of Health, said in an email. “You can find vaccine providers near you at &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinefinder.org&lt;/a&gt;. Call before you go to find out if the vaccine you want is available and how much it might cost.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Officials in Kentucky said they’re working hard to get VFC shots to providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We encourage everyone to speak with their healthcare provider and consider getting an updated COVID-19 shot this fall to help protect themselves and their family, especially those younger than 2 years of age, those older than 65 years of age, and those with conditions that place them at increased risk of severe infections, including pregnancy,” Kendra Steele, executive director in the Office of Public Affairs for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggu7wml00122e6ewmfdn1r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for Ryleigh and her grandmother, they are still waiting anxiously for her vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “You do what you’ve got to do in this life to get by, and that’s what we’re trying to do, by taking every precaution we can to not make things worse,” Brickey said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

In the US alone, usage jumped &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1645" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a staggering 700%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a staggering 700%&lt;/a&gt; between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic a natural hormone called GLP-1, which helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. They also boost insulin production, slow digestion and make people feel full longer, helping them slim down in record time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these biological changes can improve health, they may interfere with PET-CT scans, a tool doctors use to detect cancer and inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind the scare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET-CT scans combine two powerful imaging tools to give doctors a detailed picture of what’s happening in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PET scan uses a radioactive substance called FDG that travels through the bloodstream and is absorbed by tissues. Cancer cells and other abnormal cells — like those involved in inflammation — soak up more FDG because they have a higher metabolic rate, according to &lt;a href="https://www.uconnhealth.org/imaging-radiology/services-specialties/pet-ct-scans" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UConn Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UConn Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PET scanner detects the radiation emitted by the FDG, creating images that highlight where the substance has collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Doctors use PET-CT scans to diagnose cancer and inflammatory diseases, in addition to monitoring the effects of treatment. NCPIC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CT scan, meanwhile, provides detailed pictures of organs, bones and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, PET-CT scans reveal the body’s metabolic activity and its physical anatomy, helping doctors make diagnoses and track how patients respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in patients taking GLP-1s, doctors have observed unusual patterns of FDG — i.e, hot spots in the body that can mask signs of cancer or make healthy tissue look diseased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We noticed unusual uptake in one of our patients on a GLP-1 agonist, which prompted a wider review across our network,” &lt;a href="https://www.alliancemedical.co.uk/leaders/dr-peter-strouhal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Peter Strouhal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Peter Strouhal&lt;/a&gt;, medical director at Alliance Medical Ltd in the UK and lead author of the new study, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1100522?" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said in a statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that these altered patterns are increasingly common, yet there is currently no national or international guidance in the UK addressing this emerging issue,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Confusing scans, costly consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, about 1 in 8 adults report having used a GLP-1 medication like Ozempic, Wegovy or Mounjaro, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 survey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2024 survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With demand showing no signs of slowing, more patients are likely to display these unusual patterns on their PET-CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;There are no formal guidelines for doctors on how to interpret the results of FDG PET-CT scans in patients taking GLP-1s. ihorvsn – stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s especially concerning because cancer rates in the US are rising — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/no-easy-explanation-for-rising-cancer-rates-in-young-people/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:particularly among young adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;particularly among young adults&lt;/a&gt; — and early detection is crucial for successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors warn that misreading these FDG uptake patterns can lead to unnecessary tests, incorrect cancer staging and dangerous delays in care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recognizing the characteristic uptake associated with GLP-1 agonists helps avoid unnecessary anxiety and interventions, ensuring patients receive the right care, at the right time, without detours or doubt,” Strouhal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Strouhal and his colleagues don’t recommend patients stop taking GLP-1 medications before undergoing PET-CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they suggest imaging teams carefully document their patients’ medication histories to help doctors interpret their scans while formal guidelines are being developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research was presented Tuesday at the 38th Annual Congress of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team plans to expand its data collection across more imaging centers to build stronger evidence for future national guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also aim to collaborate internationally, so patients worldwide can benefit from consistent, reliable PET-CT interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 11:25:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOZHluTFNCeDAwaUtSWUVES2Q1cnhKQ0d4S1hyTXBqcTI5Y0NhMmh0MTZBM0c0OGwwWHhzZHdibTdsSDNBVGFCS3JXcExtRWt4M3R1RGEtMWJiZWxEczhLQmdFaGdod25Xdkg0N2lWdDFBclBJNkUteXBYdndzd3BYQzFXaw</guid></item><item><title>可可提取物补充剂可以减少与衰老相关的慢性炎症- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/cocoa-extract-supplements-could-reduce-aging-related-chronic-inflammation</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An extract made from cocoa beans may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing age-related inflammation, according to a recent study by an international team of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists behind the study expanded on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqac055"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggesting that flavanol-rich food and drink, such as chocolate, significantly reduced death by cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Found in cocoa beans and other foods such as green tea, apples, and grapes, flavanols have long &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;been associated&lt;/a&gt; with a variety of health improvements, including a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27092901"&gt;role in reducing damage&lt;/a&gt; caused by excess inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-cocoa-may-protect-your-body-from-fatty-foods-and-stress"&gt;Drinking Cocoa May Protect Your Body From Fatty Foods And Stress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation worsens with age in a process commonly referred to as '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-major-feature-of-aging-might-not-be-universal-after-all"&gt;inflammaging&lt;/a&gt;', and is associated with a host of age-related health problems (from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intriguing-study-suggests-inflammation-might-protect-against-not-cause-chronic-back-pain"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-link-to-alzheimers-disease-confirmed-yet-again"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cocoa supplements can reduce that inflammation, the potential benefits are significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our interest in cocoa extract and inflammaging started based on cocoa-related reductions in cardiovascular disease," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/cocoa-extract-reduces-inflammation-aging"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Howard Sesso, an epidemiologist from Brigham and Women's Hospital in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to see whether multi-year cocoa extract supplementation versus a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="176435" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; could modulate inflammaging – and the data suggests it does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176440" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176440" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/hsCRPChart-1.jpg" alt="hsCRP chart" class="wp-image-176440 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/hsCRPChart-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/hsCRPChart-1-418x415.jpg 418w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/hsCRPChart-1-600x595.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176440" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;hsCRP levels were elevated in blood tests. (Li et al., &lt;em&gt;Age and Ageing&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers enlisted 598 healthy adults aged 60 and over who were given either a 500 milligram cocoa extract supplement &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;or a placebo&lt;/a&gt; each day over two years. Across this period, inflammatory biomarkers in the blood were measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the cocoa extract significantly slowed the rise in hsCRP (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein-test/about/pac-20385228"&gt;high-sensitivity C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt;), a general biomarker for systemic inflammation and risk of cardiovascular disease. The greatest effect was detected among those who started the study period with a very high risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear what these results mean for overall health. Future research could investigate changes in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"&gt;cytokines&lt;/a&gt;, with signs suggesting a relationship exists between some of these small proteins and the cocoa extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Interestingly, we also observed an increase in interferon-γ, an immune-related cytokine, which opens new questions for future research," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/cocoa-extract-reduces-inflammation-aging"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist and population geneticist Yanbin Dong, from Augusta University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While cocoa extract is not a replacement for a healthy lifestyle, these results are encouraging and highlight its potential role in modulating inflammation as we age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cosmostrial.org/results/"&gt;A previous investigation&lt;/a&gt; called the Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study found cardiovascular-related deaths were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqac055"&gt;27 percent lower&lt;/a&gt; in a group of seniors taking cocoa supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HsCRP may be driving down that cardiovascular disease risk by reducing inflammation, with research hinting at biological mechanisms that may dial down the background hum of the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's noted that the study was in part funded by investigator-initiated grants from &lt;span&gt;Mars&lt;/span&gt; Edge, a segment of &lt;span&gt;Mars&lt;/span&gt; Incorporated. While this doesn't invalidate the findings, confectionery companies could arguably have a vested interest in health-related outcomes of taking cocoa extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, such supplements could be taken as a way to manage inflammation and reduce the risk of heart disease, meaning better health for a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study calls for more attention to the advantage of plant-based foods for cardiovascular health, including cocoa products rich in flavanols," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/cocoa-extract-reduces-inflammation-aging"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sesso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It reinforces the importance of a diverse, colorful, plant-based diet – especially in the context of inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaf269"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age and Ageing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the UK has tough restrictions on advertising these because it considers all nicotine products to be harmful to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ertonguc believes allowing a "very strict marketing framework" targeted only to adults could make smokers aware of alternatives and encourage them to switch. This is at odds with the proposed Tobacco and Vapes Bill which would ban all advertising of vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it "rejects any notion that further marketing of vapes is necessary or appropriate, or that restrictions should be eased". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The health advice is clear: vaping is never recommended for children and non-smokers. It is only recommended for adult smokers as a quit aid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It believes the bill "will stop the next generation from being hooked on nicotine".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;On Wednesday it announced a planned &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/tobacco-and-vapes-evidence-to-support-legislation/tobacco-and-vapes-evidence-to-support-legislation" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;crackdown on how vapes and tobacco products are sold&lt;/a&gt;, with a plan to force shops to get a licence to sell them, bringing them into line with alcohol regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Unlicensed sellers could be face on-the-spot fines of £2,500. This announcement came after our interview with BAT's UK boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dressed in a caramel-coloured suit, Ertonguc was composed as she settled in to the studio for the Big Boss Interview, a new business podcast from the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The 51-year-old single mother who has more than 20 years at BAT has seen the industry and the business transform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Vaping and nicotine pouches have surged to make up nearly 70% of the company's UK revenue in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Smokers are changing fast, and so are we," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While cigarettes contain a range of toxic cancer-causing chemicals, vaping may itself cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains. Therefore, it is only recommended for adult smokers trying to quit as part of the NHS "swap to stop" programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The NHS says vaping is less harmful than smoking and encourages tobacco smokers to switch to vaping to help people quit. However, because the long-term effects of vaping are not yet known and because vapes still contain addictive nicotine, it warns children and non-smokers off using vapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Challenged over vaping being bad for people's health, Ertonguc cites studies from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European organisations which suggest that nicotine, although addictive, is not in itself a cause of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Nicotine is not the cause of cancer, but it is addictive. It's not risk free," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;About 20% of 11 to 17-year-olds in the UK have tried vaping, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ash.org.uk/resources/view/use-of-e-cigarettes-among-young-people-in-great-britain" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;a 2025 survey by health charity ASH&lt;/a&gt; (Action on Smoking and Health), and 7% of that age group said they currently vaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And globally the figures are even more stark with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1kwxjzeez3o" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;at least 15 million children are using e-cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, which is fuelling a new wave of nicotine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ertonguc admits that seeing children vaping makes her uneasy. "Smoking is not a thing for youth," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Any nicotine product shouldn't be used by anyone under legal age," she maintains, despite those survey results, which amounts to hundreds of thousands of underaged vapers across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ertonguc's push for looser advertising rules for vapes may be an uphill battle. Under new DCHS proposals in the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, making its way through Parliament, all advertising of vaping products would be banned, while consultation will be opened on strengthening rules around the flavours, packaging and design of vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 geRyoc"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7cb2/live/dfc5fd30-a36e-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="BBC/BAT Profile of Asli Ertonguc.

That was the positive part. But equally, we can say the existence of disposable made the [vaping] category lose some credibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ertonguc is advocating for retail licensing, mandatory age checks, pre-market product testing and clearer health warnings to reflect the risk profile of vaping compared to smoking, and tougher penalties for those who break the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Smoke free ambition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The goal is to prevent illegal products from undermining public health efforts and to support and educate smokers in making informed choices, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ertonguc expects this approach to have a far bigger impact on reducing smoking than the government's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-tobacco-and-vapes-bill-2024" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;Tobacco and Vapes Bill&lt;/a&gt;, currently weaving its way through parliament with the aim of creating a smoke-free generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Its ultimate aim is to make it impossible for today's 15-year-olds and younger to ever legally buy tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There would also be a ban on vapes and nicotine products from being deliberately branded, promoted and advertised to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Implementation will be the biggest challenge," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The BAT executive says the penalties for shops that sell vapes to under-18s need to be increased too. "When we look at the fines, they are not very discouraging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And despite heavy uptake of vaping among youth, Ertonguc says the tobacco-free products will help the UK's ambition to reach smoke-free status by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I don't believe it is not achievable," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="the-bbc-is-speaking-to-the-bosses-of-some-of-the-uk's-biggest-firms-to-find-out-the-stories-behind-the-people-that-lead-them." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;The BBC is speaking to the bosses of some of the UK's biggest firms to find out the stories behind the people that lead them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 10:59:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBTa01oVWcyaWpudXFXRXZTcVZZZ19tWDNYQ1JfOTA0WV9DYVpJUS15Ui1XWlg3c2ZKM2NPZHRoTmtESWhXTG5KZTdrQ09BSlZyelA0YlFIbnR6UdIBX0FVX3lxTE50clFDcVZPQnVKVDI0ZU1Eb2UwTlFFclB4ak1OUDJKcTBzaUQ2Q09nX21oM1psQi1CTEpIOXRiWkRhRjFJMGdFcmRqeXByc2F0U2hUYW9oZWR5NnIzOVF3</guid></item></channel></rss>
