						&lt;p&gt;A Raleigh man is accused
of spraying blood in the eyes of health care workers. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Kameron Gilchrist, 25,
faces two charges for assaulting emergency personnel. He's accused of
exposing two employees to HIV. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the two
employees contracted HIV through the incident on March 21, 2025. Authorities
arrested Gilchrist on Sept. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;UNC Health Rex wouldn’t comment
on specific patient or employee incidents. The hospital said violence against
medical personnel is becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the arrest
warrant, Gilchrist was receiving a diabetic treatment when he allegedly sprayed
blood in the eyes of two hospital employees. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It’s
unclear whether the blood sprayed was Gilchrist’s
or not.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;However, the arrest warrant
says the two hospital employees were caused physical injuries including
irritation and exposure to HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;UNC REX
told WRAL News that protecting the health and safety of its employees is a top
priority. The hospital said it would work closely with its own security teams
and law enforcement to keep everyone safe and pursue charges when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News asked Raleigh police
why it took six months to arrest and charge Gilchrist.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Raleigh police said Gilchrist
was receiving medical and psychiatric treatment at the time of the incident so
he could not be arrested then.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Authorities are holding
Gilchrist on $25,000 bond. His next court date is scheduled for Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Ars Technica in August, Brigid Groves, vice president of professional affairs for the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) signaled that efforts to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines is concerning to APhA, which is the leading organization representing pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned about that because the data and evidence point to the fact that this vaccine is safe and effective for [young, otherwise healthy] patients," Groves said. "So, to suddenly arbitrarily limit that is very concerning to us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, with the CDC's permissive recommendations, pharmacies are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; limiting them. Representatives for both CVS and Walgreens &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/06/cdc-covid-vaccine-rules-eligibility-availability/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzU5NzIzMjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMTA1NTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NTk3MjMyMDAsImp0aSI6ImZlZjBlODg3LTU5ZjMtNDk3YS1iNjczLWVkYzllYzRlMDg0MiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyNS8xMC8wNi9jZGMtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS1ydWxlcy1lbGlnaWJpbGl0eS1hdmFpbGFiaWxpdHkvIn0.1KVy4WMWh2DE7lNseEMo-5J4KtGZtRkqt9P_6HtMQUs"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that they would not require patients under 65 to prove they have an underlying condition to get a COVID-19 vaccine. CVS won't ask you to self-attest to having a condition, and Walgreens also said that it won't require any proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In simplest terms, if a patient wants to get the vaccine, they’ll get it," Amy Thibault, a CVS spokesperson, told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the shared decision-making, there may be extra forms about risks and benefits that might take an extra few minutes, but it should otherwise be just like past years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, this reporter was able to easily book same-day appointments for an updated COVID-19 vaccine at local CVS and Walgreens pharmacies in North Carolina, without attesting to any medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shots for younger children could be trickier&lt;/strong&gt;: While adults and older children can visit their pharmacy and get vaccinated relatively easily, younger children (particularly those under age 5) may have a harder time. Pharmacists typically do not vaccinate those younger children—which has always been the case—and parents will have to visit the pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians, like pharmacists, are likely to be supportive of broad access to the shots. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said that &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;all children should have access&lt;/a&gt;. The AAP also specifically encourages children under age 2 and children with underlying conditions to get vaccinated, because those children are at higher risk of severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

In healthy individuals, this gene is typically active only in alpha cells, which produce glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, to raise blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the SMOC1 gene is active in beta cells. This is a critical problem because beta cells produce insulin, another hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, to lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people with T2D, beta cells are reprogrammed into dysfunctional alpha-like cells, and the SMOC1 gene is the primary driver of this damaging transformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, introducing the SMOC1 protein to healthy beta cells impaired their ability to produce and release insulin. The inability to make or use insulin effectively is the defining characteristic of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discovering SMOC1 as the key culprit driving the harmful transformation could lead to the development of a drug to block SMOC1's action and halt &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15078069/treatment-reverse-type-2-diabetes-banish-insulin-jabs.html"&gt;the progression of T2D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Geming Lur, co-corresponding author and researcher at City of Hope, one of the country’s most advanced cancer treatment organizations, said: ‘Normally, SMOC1 is active in healthy people’s alpha cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But we saw it start showing up in the diabetic beta cells, too. It should not have been there.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study identifies SMOC1 as the key driver of beta cell failure, making it a promising drug target. Blocking it could protect insulin-producing cells and halt T2D progression (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using advanced single-cell RNA sequencing, City of Hope scientists analyzed pancreatic tissue from 26 donors: 13 with T2D, which affects more than 37 million Americans, and 13 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This approach allowed the researchers not only to identify cell types but also to categorize the cells into precise groups and map the dysfunctional pathways that cause insulin-producing cells to transform and fail in people with T2D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After gathering a massive genetic dataset, the team used sophisticated computational analyses to identify the five alpha cell subtypes, including AB cells, immature cells that can develop into either alpha or beta cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To confirm that the gene SMOC1 was a key driver of beta cell dysfunction, the researchers increased SMOC1 levels in human beta cells in the lab and observed a direct, detrimental effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insulin production dropped and the cells began to lose their identity, transforming into a different, dysfunctional cell type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further tests revealed that SMOC1 crippled beta cell function by simultaneously halting insulin secretion and disrupting the cell's ability to produce new, functional insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is critical because insulin is the hormone that signals to the body's cells to allow sugar from the blood to enter and be used for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without enough properly functioning insulin, sugar builds up in the bloodstream, which is the root cause of the high blood sugar levels that define diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers' final round of validation showed that SMOC1 protein levels were significantly higher in diabetic patients and, critically, that this protein was present within the insulin-producing beta cells themselves, confirming its role in the human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Randy Kang, senior research associate at City of Hope and a co-author, said: ‘The SMOC1 gene has barely been studied in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Based on these properties, we suspect SMOC1 strongly influences the differentiation and function of beta cells.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This discovery opens a new front in diabetes treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While current medications like GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic, manage blood sugar, a therapy that directly targets and inhibits SMOC1 could be the first to address the root cause of beta cell failure by protecting their identity and function, potentially halting or reversing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, there are no approved gene therapies targeting the SMOC1 gene for T2D. The discovery of SMOC1's role is very recent, placing it at the earliest stages of therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62670-5#Sec2"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists has identified five different sleep profiles that link the quality of a person's shut-eye with a variety of health, psychological, and lifestyle outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's something we all do frequently, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;science of sleep&lt;/a&gt; is still pretty murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the scientists examined multiple aspects of sleep quality and how they related to a variety of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-6-sleep-traits-to-risk-of-172-diseases"&gt;Massive Study Links 6 Sleep Traits to Risk of 172 Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed information on 770 healthy young adults collected through the Human Connectome Project, which includes brain imaging data as well as patient-reported sleep, health, and lifestyle characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this together, the team identified five distinct sleep-biopsychosocial profiles that show unique patterns of brain network organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first profile links poor sleep with negative mental health outcomes. Patients fitting this profile showed a range of sleep problems, particularly taking longer to fall asleep at night and being less satisfied with their sleep overall. They expressed higher  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, stress, fear, and anger problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176639" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-642x267.png" alt="Study Says There Are 5 Types of Sleeper – Here's What Your Profile Says About Your Health" class="wp-image-176639 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-642x267.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-998x415.png 998w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-768x319.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-600x250.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1.png 1046w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The first sleep profile in the study shows clear links between a range of sleep issues and mental health outcomes. (Perrault et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biol.&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the second profile presented no major sleep problems, but still had mental health issues, including higher  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, anger, stress, fear, and sadness, and lower conscientiousness. For patients in this group, their issues likely stem from other causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third profile was defined largely by the use of sleep aid medications. People in this group demonstrated greater conscientiousness and reported feeling more satisfied in their friendships and emotional support networks. However, they also showed increased cognitive problems with visual episodic memory, fluid intelligence, and spatial orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profile number four was mostly linked to sleep duration, with fewer hours of rest associated with more aggressive behavior and difficulty with emotional processing, language, and fluid intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the fifth profile was driven largely by sleep disturbances, waking frequently during the night. These patients also exhibited aggressive behavior and similar cognitive issues as profile four, but were also more likely to have thought problems, anxiety, high blood pressure, be smokers, and show symptoms of alcohol dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The different sleep profiles were also supported by unique patterns of brain function measured with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that sleep experiences are reflected not just in health and behavior, but also in the brain's wiring and activity," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/what-type-of-sleeper-are-you-and-how-is-it-impacting-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Aurore Perrault, neuroscientist at Concordia University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sleep has been extensively studied, most studies examine single factors in isolation, correlating with single outcomes. The team hopes that by looking at a wider range of associations and understanding which of the five profiles best describes each patient, doctors may better diagnose and treat sleep disorders and related health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, research is constantly revealing new ways that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-to-be-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;sleep is linked with our wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-begins-to-suffer-after-just-3-nights-of-bad-sleep"&gt;Too little is unhealthy&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of ways – but so is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-study-found-too-much-sleep-increases-risk-of-death-heres-why"&gt;too much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;hours aren't a good measure&lt;/a&gt; alone: some people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-do-some-people-need-less-sleep-the-answer-lies-in-our-genes"&gt;naturally need more or less&lt;/a&gt; than others.

The warning asks anyone who returns from affected regions and develops a sudden fever, headache, or intense body aches to contact a clinician quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oropouche&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes called sloth fever because the virus circulates in sloths in parts of Latin America. Most people recover within a week, though a small number can develop brain or nerve complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah A. J. Guagliardo, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), has led recent work clarifying how quickly symptoms start and what that means for travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symptoms-of-oropouche-virus"&gt;Symptoms of Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus belongs to the Orthobunyavirus group and is an arbovirus, meaning a virus that is spread to people by biting insects. It was first identified in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness usually causes an abrupt fever, pounding headache, and joint and muscle pain. Some patients also report nausea, light sensitivity, and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors sometimes hear about symptom relapse a few days after apparent recovery. That second wave is uncomfortable, but most people still recover fully with rest and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-know-about-the-u-k-cases"&gt;What we know about the U.K. cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/communicable-disease-threats-report-week-34-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;surveillance&lt;/a&gt; in Europe recorded three travel-linked Oropouche cases in U.K. residents. All three people had visited Brazil in early 2025. The cases were all were imported, with no sign of local spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern matches what other European countries saw in 2024 and 2025. Imported infections arrive with travelers, then stop because the key insect that spreads this virus is not established in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mosquitoes-may-spread-oropouche"&gt;Mosquitoes may spread Oropouche&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus spreads mainly through the bites of infected biting midges, tiny insects that thrive in warm, humid areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mosquito species can also transmit it. People who spend time outdoors without repellent or window screens are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are studying vertical transmission, which is when a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/giant-dormant-virus-punuivirus-discovered-in-algae-could-revolutionize-gene-editing/"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; passes from a pregnant person to the fetus. That question matters for travel counseling even if the overall risk remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual spread has not been documented, but health agencies note that the virus has been detected in semen and vaginal secretions. That finding warrants caution for recent travelers who develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incubation-of-oropouche-virus"&gt;Incubation of Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fever can rise quickly, often with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and aching joints. Clinicians also watch for rashes, dizziness, and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In conclusion, our results indicate that 50% of travelers infected with OROV will develop symptoms within 3 to 4 days of exposure,” wrote Dr. Guagliardo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0468_article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of travel-associated cases estimated the incubation period using patient exposure timelines and symptom onset data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relapse of symptoms can occur in a significant share of patients. That possibility helps explain why some people feel better, then feel unwell again several days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pregnancy-and-severe-outcomes"&gt;Pregnancy and severe outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-7-2024-qa-oropouche-fever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the first Oropouche-related deaths on July 25, 2024, and investigators also examined possible mother to child infections during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those events were rare, but health authorities continue to analyze what factors increase risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doctors also see neck stiffness, confusion, or persistent severe headache, they consider meningitis or encephalitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are uncommon complications of Oropouche but need urgent care because they involve inflammation around the brain or in the brain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prevention-that-actually-works"&gt;Prevention that actually works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;U,K. health &lt;a href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2025/08/13/what-are-the-symptoms-of-oropouche-virus-disease-and-how-can-you-avoid-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-repellents-that-actually-work-yes-thanks-to-ai-machine-learning/"&gt;repellents&lt;/a&gt; with at least 50 percent DEET for travelers to affected areas, along with long sleeves and trousers during peak biting hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other precautions include staying in rooms with air conditioning or secure window screens, sleeping under fine mesh nets, removing standing water near lodging, and carefully following insecticide instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who recently returned to the U.K. from the Americas and develop sudden fever should call a clinician and mention their travel history. Early testing helps rule out other infections with similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prevention-guidelines-for-travelers"&gt;Prevention guidelines for travelers &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;International health agencies emphasize that Oropouche virus joins a longer list of insect-borne infections that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hpv-common-virus-drives-skin-cancer-growth-by-hijacking-the-bodys-cells/"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; travelers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agencies often package advice on Zika, dengue, chikungunya, malaria and Oropouche together, since all rely on insect bites for spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to encourage simple habits, like packing repellents before trips, just as routinely as carrying sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities also point out that individual precautions are only part of the picture. Surveillance, early diagnosis, and coordinated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-borne-diseases-are-a-growing-threat-in-a-warming-world/"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt; control in affected countries remain the backbone of prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without these broader efforts, even well-prepared travelers may still face risks when outbreaks surge in tropical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-questions-about-oropouche-virus"&gt;More questions about Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKHSA recently &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/689ca9d49a65499b446361ff/oropouche-virus-a-rapid-evidence-gap-map.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mapped&lt;/a&gt; 269 studies on Oropouche and found strong evidence on surveillance and viral genomics, yet very limited research on vaccines, treatments, and real-world public health measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no human clinical trials of medicines and few data on which community interventions curb spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those gaps matter for planning.

But global efforts to find treatments for drug-resistant infections are not going to plan, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;according to two reports from the World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; released on 2 October&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reports show that the global antibiotic drug-development pipeline is facing a dual crisis: a scarcity of drugs in development and a lack of innovation in methods to fight drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antimicrobial resistance is escalating, but the pipeline of new treatments and diagnostics is insufficient to tackle the spread of drug-resistant bacterial infections,” said Yukiko Nakatani, who is the WHO assistant director-general for health systems in Geneva, Switzerland, in a statement. “Without more investment in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), together with dedicated efforts to ensure that new and existing products reach the people who most need them, drug-resistant infections will continue to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health research has highlighted the extent of the AMR crisis. A report published in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; last year found that the annual number of deaths from drug-resistant infections could increase to nearly two million by 2050, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;up from one million a year between 1990 and 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The total number of deaths attributable to AMR is predicted to rise to 1.91 million in 2050, with a further 8.22 million associated deaths (see ‘Resistance on the rise’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Awareness of this issue is increasing; however, it is still a silent pandemic with many deaths not being attributed to AMR,” says Rietie Venter, a microbiologist at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543782.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543782.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Resistance on the rise.

According to the analysis from the WHO, 90 antibacterial drugs are currently in development (see ‘Innovation crisis’). However, only 15 qualify as innovative — drugs that exert an additional clinically significant benefit — and only five are effective against at least one of the ‘critical bacteria’ listed on the WHO’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;bacterial priority pathogen list&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2023, the number of antibacterial drugs in clinical-development pipelines has decreased after a WHO ruling stated that some of them were non-innovative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preclinical pipeline remains active, with 232 programmes across 148 groups worldwide. However, 90% of companies involved are small firms, which highlights the fragility of the R&amp;amp;D ecosystem, the report says. Large pharmaceutical companies have been leaving the antibiotics market for years owing to a lack of financial investment and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;low approval ratings of new antibiotics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543794.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543794.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Innovation crisis.

AMR happens when bacteria and other microorganisms evolve ways to become resistant to drugs after being exposed to them, meaning drug makers have to play a constant cat-and-mouse game of creating new antibiotics to overcome evolving resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs in human medicine and agriculture are the main drivers of AMR, which is why cuts to antibiotic usage are needed to reduce drug-resistant infections, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00961-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00961-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;alongside new antibiotic therapies&lt;/a&gt;. Gwen Knight and Kathryn Holt, who are co-directors of the AMR Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, say that there are insufficient data to know the relative importance of livestock versus human antibiotic use in driving AMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World leaders have committed to cutting the global use of antibiotics to reduce AMR-related deaths by 10% by 2030. However, the pledge doesn’t look likely to succeed, because projections suggest that antibiotic use in both humans and livestock will increase in the years ahead (see ‘Animal antimicrobials’). “We cannot prevent the development of AMR, but we can implement measures to slow it down, and currently, we are not super successful with this,” says Venter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543780.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543780.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Animal antimicrobials.

Many of the deadliest infections are caused by a group of bacteria with particularly strong drug resistance, called gram-negative bacteria.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the pandemic, it has become common for counties or healthcare systems to enact mask requirements ahead of the winter cold and flu season - what doctors have called the 'quad-demic' - to try and prevent co-occurring outbreaks of the flu, Covid, the common cold and RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Face masks became a mainstay during the Covid pandemic, with pro-maskers arguing they helped prevent infections by catching virus-laden droplets expelled when people sneeze, cough or talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11702865/Masks-make-little-no-difference-Covid-infections-massive-cross-country-meta-analysis-finds.html"&gt; major review &lt;/a&gt;by the Cochrane Collaboration, the 'gold standard' for evidence-based investigations, found that coverings made 'little to no difference' to Covid infection or death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts have warned that many masks contain holes that are too large to catch droplets, saying people should use medical-grade N95 masks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others have raised concerns that failing to wash reusable masks regularly can turn them into a breeding ground for bacteria, increasing the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California had a strict mask mandate during the Covid pandemic, with face masks required statewide in most public settings from June 2020 until June 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2021 to February 2022, the state reimposed mask mandates for indoor areas again amid a surge in Covid cases and hospitalizations. Multiple counties in California also pursued more stringent masking policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Federally, face masks were required to be worn on federal property and public transport from January 2021 until June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During his first term, President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom clashed over face masks, with Newsom consistently wearing a mask at briefings during 2020 while Trump notably refused to wear one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above are pedestrians wearing face masks in San Francisco in June 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Announcing the new face mask order, the Sonoma County's department of health said that it had first required visitors and staff to wear face masks at its health care facilities in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It said this year's order covered fewer health care facilities than in previous years, and said the order would apply annually unless it is rescinded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid cases have dropped slightly since August in California, according to wastewater data, when the state was recording 'very high' levels of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Covid activity in California remains 'high', above the 'moderate' level nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, wastewater surveillance suggests Covid levels dropped from 'high' to 'moderate' over the week to September 20, the latest available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both flu and RSV levels, however, are 'very low' in the US and California, according to wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it is still early in the respiratory virus season, which the CDC says falls between October to mid-May every year, with viruses peaking between December and February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest complete data for the week to September 6, California had a Covid hospitalization rate of 4.4 per 100,000 people, the same as the previous week, but nearly double the rate of 2.6 nationwide over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state's Covid death rate was around 0.1 fatalities per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both hospitalization and death rates are well below the peaks they hit during the pandemic, when hundreds of Covid-linked deaths were recorded in the US every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new mandate, however, comes amid growing concerns over a new Covid variant that appears to be causing cases to surge in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strain XFG, also known as Stratus, has become dominant nationwide and in every region except the South since its first appearance in the US in March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say it is more infectious than previous strains, although it does not appear to be more likely to cause a severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns over the variant are rising as the US heads into respiratory virus season, when cold temperatures lead people to spend more time crowded indoors, where respiratory viruses spread easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:18:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPQ1hPQ2dTeEFibE9EcTdYaWpweFRmRGxfaW5Tajd3TkZLVWh3SjZLaTZlYVpzM09MUFlnUDNmZ3Q1TXJIRkNSOEZubDZjVTNZdDNWUXc2ME45QUF4Z3E4Vzdzd0xuOGVOdXFHaHVLTTVkeXVpY3ktZzNiMWQxV1pNUVY1SWRmbE04NjZtVDNOQ28zQ2ZSaHfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTUlvalZ1WWpraVhmb2VSQTFsdTlFWEFNTXJibWhhRVd3QTdqTFFEQm5MeDVLdU54OWhfQ1Q2QnFEYk5pdi1taG5DLWtwRHVXb2lSWldTV2tUT1pIei1DZUVNY2hQNTJ1cVVBSVFOUjAyeGpuNHRtY0lwM2tHTW5tel9yeEdpaVJOaUlsQVFHMjdTWnEydExmb0ZQXzQ</guid></item><item><title>如何快速击败冬季感冒（你可以忘记维生素C ） -《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/beat-winter-cold-fast-immunologist/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;However, there are two other vitamins with good evidence for supporting the immune system – &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/vitamin-d/"&gt;vitamins D&lt;/a&gt; and A. A 2020 review in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients &lt;/em&gt;concluded there is an “indisputable relation” between &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/supplements-worth-taking1/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system, with a deficiency possibly leading to infection or an autoimmune condition. Davis therefore recommends sticking to NHS guidance and taking a vitamin D tablet each day during the winter months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D exists in two main forms – D2 which comes from plants and fortified foods like plant-based cereals, and D3 which is produced in human skin and found in animal-based foods like fish and egg yolks. Evidence suggests that vitamin D3 is generally more effective than D2 at raising and maintaining vitamin levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, there is a wealth of evidence which suggests that vitamin A helps the immune system to work properly. Davis says deficiency is rare in the UK (but a significant issue in some parts of the world), as most people here consume enough vitamin A in their diets with cheese, eggs, oily fish, milk and liver products all being good sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men need 700mcg of vitamin A and women 600mcg a day, according to the NHS. (One large hard-boiled egg contains around 75mcg, 100g of cooked salmon contains roughly 69mcg, whilst a tablespoon of cod liver oil contains a substantial 4,080mcg of vitamin A.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The myth: Eating probiotic yogurts to stay healthy through winter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurts with health benefits are all the rage nowadays, but whilst they seem convenient, Davis urges caution against &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/yogurt-greek-fermented-good-for-gut-immune-system/"&gt;probiotic yogurts&lt;/a&gt; that neatly package gut health and immunity-boosting benefits into an easily consumable bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These brands may create the impression that the bacteria in your yogurt drink will boost your immune health but, quite simply, this isn’t yet clearly proven,” he says. “Whilst the experiments are clear in that the bacteria in your microbiome certainly do influence your immune system, the gap in our knowledge is exactly how this relationship works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his most recent book – &lt;em&gt;Self Defence: A Myth-busting Guide to Immune Health&lt;/em&gt; (Vintage, 2025) – Davis references &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22052061/"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; where volunteers were fed a particular strain of live bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium infantis 35624&lt;/em&gt; for eight weeks. In that time, the levels of T cells (white blood cells which help your immune system fight germs) in their blood increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that probiotics in the form of live bacteria could feasibly support immunity, however it stops short of proving a medical benefit because we don’t know if an increased number of T cells improved those participants’ protection from infections and viruses, Davis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re scanning the supermarket shelves, he urges us to “beware of the hype” and take a step back to think about who is promoting a product with miraculous health benefits, if they have an agenda, and what the evidence really shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What actually works: Managing long-term stress&lt;/h2&gt;

This vaccine is preferred by one in six parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;O’Neill said providers were previously deterred from counseling patients on the benefits and risks of Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Informed consent is back,” O’Neill said in the statement. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were no limitations on such discussions, which are common between patients and providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unless people mime their vaccine request, there’s always some discussion before a vaccine is given,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor focused on vaccines at UC Law San Francisco .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When patients go to a pharmacy or a doctor’s office for vaccines, they are already undergoing shared decision-making, Reiss said. “Unless the goal is to only have the conversation to deter people, what does this do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is also beyond the ACIP’s purview to require discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thomas Nguyen, a pediatrician and associate professor of pediatrics at Ohio University Medical School, notes “the problem is they aren’t allowed to do this”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Federal law allows the CDC to update its Vaccine Information Statement (VIS), which providers must offer to every vaccine recipient or their caregiver. But “they have no basis to require a discussion”, he said, and informed consent is already the standard for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every pediatric Covid vaccine we have given, I have offered to discuss the risks and benefits with the family and every single one has declined,” Nguyen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The families who are getting Covid vaccines already know they want it, he continued. “The people who want to get a Covid vaccine for their kids are the ones who are really committed to it, who have done their research and feel like it’s a good idea for their kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the delays in recommending the vaccines have created obstacles for families who want them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program covers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/pdfs/mm7333e1-H.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;52%&lt;/a&gt; of children in the US: anyone under the age of 19 who is under-insured or uninsured, eligible for or enrolled in Medicaid, or Native American or Alaska Native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccines are included in the program only when they’re recommended by the CDC, so children who would normally receive Covid vaccines through VFC have not been able to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Every visit this fall has been the same, said Elias Kass, a naturopathic physician in Washington state specializing in pediatric primary care. Families asked about seasonal vaccines, and he told them about the annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Then they say: ‘And Covid?’” Each time, he answered: “Nope. We don’t have Covid vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Washington is one of &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/resources/aim-policy-maps/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;12 states and territories&lt;/a&gt;, along with the city of Houston, with a universal VFC program, which means they offer vaccines for free to all children (and, in some places, all adults). In universal states, providers order all vaccines through the VFC program – but they couldn’t order any Covid vaccines at all without the CDC recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We still don’t have doses in hand,” Kass said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The timing was critical, as flu vaccination campaigns have already gotten under way for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are missing a really crucial window to vaccinate kids. We have been giving flu vaccines for a couple of weeks,” Kass said. “​​It’s a huge lost opportunity. I don’t know if we’ll get those families to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition to limiting boosters for young children, the delay has “created this huge gap for our infants”, Kass said, “who are at very high risk of complicated Covid”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Covid vaccines have been plagued by persistent access issues and misinformation, resulting in already low vaccination rates among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Approximately 10,000 six-month-olds become eligible to receive Covid-19 vaccines every day, but parents continue to struggle to find access to that vaccine,” said Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and chief medical officer of the Association of Immunization Managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the stakes are high. Children under two, especially infants, are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high risk&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalization and death, second only to people aged 75 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children may also suffer from long Covid, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/30/health/long-covid-children.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;repeat infections&lt;/a&gt;, and unknown complications could arise long after infection – as sometimes happens with viruses like measles, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr, and cytomegalovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The delay caused “huge” equity issues, Kass said, especially among children who have been marginalized within the health system because of socioeconomic status or racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were already significant access issues plaguing pediatric vaccines across the country, with some providers declining to stock the vaccines due to a perceived lack of interest and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The argument that I often hear from pediatricians is that they don’t stock Covid vaccines because there’s low demand,” said Fiscus. “But the reality is that parents do call and ask for the vaccine, but are told that it’s not being stocked. So to an extent, that’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some providers offer outdated reasons for not stocking the vaccines, like previous needs for ultra-cold storage or multi-dose vials, Kass said. “They’re justifying not stocking it with reasons that are no longer relevant, but they’re assuming nobody wants it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS press release also highlighted “vaccine safety signals” and “unintended side effects during routine immunization”, even though the Covid vaccines are extremely safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That’s “the biggest problem” among Nguyen’s patients, he said. Certain health officials and Republican politicians have been very vocal about the purported risks of Covid vaccines “to the point that almost nobody wants them”, he said. This fall, he has given out 325 flu shots and only 16 Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPaE1GNFFqZ0t6ZlNoOVp6UnJIWHF3eXlaWXE4UUNIbGN3M3c1elFDRUN6NXk4RHRCMjZDRWVKRF9xbldRMFdZRUVZZl9sVXZkZUVXencxamF1aXFUNE43WUFLMXI5Uy03SVpnRkF4X0dTcHRhTnpYajZYRW9zZGZQWG96b1BjMUdhRDdWTVFDRlYwUnB0cGp2S2QtNA</guid></item><item><title>服用太多泰诺已被证明有风险。特朗普没有谈论这些。-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/health/tylenol-acetominophen-liver-damage-kenvue.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:43:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQUFdadVpJVVNzYnUtU091bTRNaWJWLXQ5bUs4cW1vUGVFSUVzZ3puYkJ5REtZOUpiU0c3LTVPUm14Yy1CTU5fRXQteVgzWl9Ua0F3Nnc3M1VVbzVvM3U0ekZyRU94MG00LWI2VnFsd1dmRmdqdmotdG5Cb0xVUlkzc01fOWN0U1pwMDFETDZBRmplUQ</guid></item><item><title>这种生活方式因素与阿尔茨海默氏症有关- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/lifestyle-factor-linked-alzheimers-110000248.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;This Lifestyle Factor Is Now Linked to Alzheimer's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Philip Friedman for Women's Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new study explores the connection between &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a42679413/causes-of-obesity-genetics-lifestyle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a43582040/alzheimers-first-signs-may-appear-in-eyes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Researchers found different cellular messengers in people with obesity that signal plaque formation in the brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's what this means for you, according to doctors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still don’t know exactly what causes&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232091/alzheimers-treatments-womens-brains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. But as more and more research funnels in, there are lots of new theories and datapoints trying to draw a clear picture of the devastating disease. Now, there's another factor to consider: New research suggests that obesity could fuel Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While obesity has been linked to a range of serious health conditions like&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19994093/heart-disease-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65933499/three-habits-lower-diabetes-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, the Alzheimer’s disease connection is new. It’s important to point out that the researchers didn’t find that having obesity &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; Alzheimer’s disease—they just found a link. But it raises a lot of questions about why the two might be connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what a neurologist and obesity medicine specialist want you to keep in mind when trying to parse this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clifford Segil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers isolated something called extracellular vesicles from fat cells. These vesicles are cell-to-cell messengers in the body and they can signal the buildup of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65872748/omega-3-women-alzheimers-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyloid-β plaque;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amyloid-β plaque&lt;/a&gt;—a key feature of Alzheimer’s disease—in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gets very technical, but the researchers basically discovered that the fat composition in these cell messengers is different in people with obesity. The obesity factor was also correlated with how quickly amyloid-β clumped together in lab models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, the researchers suggest that targeting these little cellular messengers and interrupting their plaque-building signals may help lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is obesity linked with Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear. The researchers simply found a link between the way certain cells act in people with obesity and the potential formation of plaques in the brain. But so far, there's no evidence that obesity causes Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a novel idea and obesity in the past has not been considered a modifiable risk factor for memory loss,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be a few reasons for this link, though. “This study provides a potential explanation that perhaps fat cells are releasing substances that are being transported to the brain, causing a buildup of amyloid plaques that can contribute to Alzheimer’s disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. But he stresses that more research is needed to learn more about this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic inflammation caused by obesity could impact the brain as well,” Dr. Ali says. “But nobody is 100 percent sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are extracellular vesicles and what role do they play in the body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles are tiny particles that travel throughout the body and act as messengers in cell-to-cell communication. They are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier which means they can interact directly with receptors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A certain amount of fat or lipids are necessary for our body to work well,” Dr. Segil explains. “Many chemicals in our bodies are bundled into small packages and produced in one part and then used in another part of the body. These packages that these substances are transported in around the body requires a [fat] outer membrane to being transported and these packages are called ‘vesicles.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to reduce my risk of developing Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Segil points out that having obesity is an “unclear” risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. However, it is a risk factor for diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, Dr. Ali recommends doing what you can to maintain a healthy weight by eating a varied diet and exercising regularly. If that doesn’t help, he suggests talking to your healthcare provider about next steps. “There are a lot of option to help,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower your risk of dementia in particular, Dr. Segil recommends doing what you can to eat a healthy diet and get in daily exercise. He also suggests keeping your brain “busy” as much as possible. That means socializing regularly, and pushing yourself to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:12:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxORW5HaVhnTHZJakEtSXlNRTFGX28tTGlWQlhwaldCWEtoN25vTVV3WlJ1aW9ZU2x0bTlIRUtxaG51MEgxcTkteFhSd25zejdiRWJrbEFjbE9qNlRDakQzZHZuMUhNSWM5LUFVVXE3ZGxVQzdEZU5tVzVIdmFNYkNhcHlUbzM</guid></item><item><title>冠状病毒专家建议再次佩戴口罩- Glasgow Live</title><link>https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/wear-face-masks-again-covid-32627965</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss Covid experts are urging the public to start wearing face masks once more, just three years since the Covid-19 pandemic was officially declared over. The recommendation comes amid rising Covid cases across the UK, with health officials anticipating a surge in viral infections throughout the winter months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immunologists in Switzerland have stressed that wearing a face mask remains an effective way to reduce the transmission of viruses such as Covid. While the guidance is primarily aimed at those most at risk of developing severe illness from viral infections, including elderly people or those with weakened immune systems, experts have also indicated that people who aren't considered vulnerable may choose to wear a mask as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the height of the pandemic in the UK, the government introduced compulsory rules on wearing face coverings in specific public areas where the danger of transmitting the virus was greatest. These included shops, supermarkets, public transport, and NHS facilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tanja Stadler, an epidemiologist at ETH Zurich and chairwoman of the Swiss Confederation's Covid scientific task force, told SonntagsZeitung: "In crowded, enclosed spaces, such as public transportation, it's advisable for vulnerable people - those over 65 or those with compromised immune systems. Even those who aren't vulnerable can protect themselves from troublesome infections and, at the same time, show solidarity with others."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tanja stressed, though, that she isn't calling on respective governments to impose another compulsory face mask mandate like the one implemented during the height of the pandemic. Instead, she suggested authorities should establish a 'virus bulletin' to help notify people of potential virus hotspots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She continued: "Data on the spread of viruses already exists, but it's not easily accessible to the public. Making it available would help those who want to protect themselves act accordingly."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Likewise, Marcel Tanner, a professor emeritus of public health at the University of Basel and a former member of the Covid Task Force, said: "After everything we've learned, it would be logical for anyone with a cold to wear a mask, at least on public transportation."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The current Covid situation in the UK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the most recent figures from the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), from October 3, there has been a substantial rise in Covid cases per week. In the week ending September 24, there were 2,459 newly confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, by September 10, there was a 7.6 per cent spike in cases across England compared to the previous week. The majority of these fresh cases are being fuelled by the new Stratus strain of Coronavirus, which has two variants - XFG and XFG. 3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new variant has been flagged for potentially causing a significantly severe hoarse voice, in addition to the usual symptoms such as fever and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, experts have emphasised that current data does not suggest this variant is any more deadly than other variants currently in circulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Allen from the UKHSA stated: "Based on the available information so far, there is no evidence to suggest that the XFG and XFG.3 variants cause more severe disease than previous variants, or that the vaccines in current use will be less effective against them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the World Health Organisation has classified the XFG strand as posing a 'low risk' globally. It said: "XFG is growing rapidly compared to co-circulating variants globally. However, XFG exhibits only marginal additional immune evasion over [other variant] LP.8.1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"While there are reported increases in cases and hospitalisations in some of the [southeast Asia region] countries, which has the highest proportion of XFG, there are no reports to suggest that the associated disease severity is higher as compared to other circulating variants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The available evidence on XFG does not suggest additional public health risks relative to the other currently circulating Omicron descendant lineages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Glasgow Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 12:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5vdjhNN3VzSVhyT0JrVW5VQWlvWTRjMW9JQmJOSUdnT0FQWkpHVEE4NWhqdEdEakx2WWlyTTRGZHRyZWl5RjhjVHQ2cmYyeEVXbFRQUUhVTFNEYzVlR01KVkxNZGRhbjhXbDZjVHJTSEwtUHRGTktiZmNPSdIBgAFBVV95cUxNcWRtd3V1ek9WSjBRNnhoUnM5QjQ1aTdXUllGWTZtbTJWcVNKWWxaRjJNakhhNm5LNm1KWjJZUHRuY3lFbVpqM2NmNW0xeUhJWlpFVWxLR3d2anJpMWFaX3NWemNRSlBhY3hPcm9icFlHYzBXbW0yZHVBN3NfWVVNVg</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎专家建议在疫情结束仅三年后再次佩戴口罩- The Mirror</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/wear-a-face-mask-covid-36026620</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_4d0286" publication="mirror"&gt;Covid experts advise wearing masks again just three years after pandemic ended&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_1cc836" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Some people are being urged to start wearing face masks again as we enter the winter period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_byline-container__K_Owl" data-testid="byline"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-content" class="Byline_byline-content-wrapper__Imque"&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_author-badge-date-wrapper__Q7jj1"&gt;&lt;p class="Byline_dates-container__Rqzf2"&gt;&lt;span class="" data-testid="byline-publishedDate"&gt;13:16, 07 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Byline_updated-date__8vEV8 Byline_updated-date-with-published__ApG_G" data-testid="byline-updatedDate"&gt;Updated 13:21, 07 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="LightboxBtn_lightbox-btn__eoxYS" aria-label="Open image viewer" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-controls="image-lightbox"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="36026878"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Some people are being asked to wear face masks once again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-credit__uNiU6"&gt;(Image: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;Swiss&lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt; Covid experts &lt;/a&gt;are saying members of the public should start wearing face masks again, just three years after the Covid-19 pandemic officially ended.

                Insecticide-treated bed nets keep mosquitoes from biting at night, but what how do you protect babies when they're out and about? One researcher had an idea that involved the traditional bab-carrying wrap used in sub-Saharan Africa.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit. &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/people/ross-boyce-md-msc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ross Boyce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It seems sort of an obvious thing to do," he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/11/22/503036774/the-new-debate-over-bed-nets" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bed nets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can only protect kids while they're sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. "That was probably overkill," says Boyce. "But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The answer: a resounding yes. "It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations," says Boyce.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501628" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a reduction of about 65%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so," says &lt;a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/trmd/thom-eisele" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thomas Eisele&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools," says Eisele. "These types of interventions are going to be critical."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/11/627843581/if-you-spray-your-clothes-with-permethrin-be-careful-around-the-cat" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Permethrin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin," he says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered," he says, "but we know getting malaria is not good for children either."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author &lt;a href="https://scispace.com/authors/edgar-mulogo-6r142y3bct" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Edgar Mulogo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. "The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous," he says. He heard one participant say "when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            Most Americans with health insurance should not have to pay out of pocket for Covid-19 vaccines, even after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added an extra hurdle to getting the shot. But some people could face new costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6m90002356ng3l57x4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC adopted its &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F09%2F19%2Fhealth%2Fcdc-acip-hepatitis-mmrv-covid-vaccine&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7C52f04ba9b3bd4446259a08de0502fa5b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638953707507123670%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=zXUXbx06rkpD4C0bYjhwvyS0wUIOvJh1y8Tcn7E1HiY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisers’ vote&lt;/a&gt; to shift away from a broad recommendation for Covid-19 immunization; people who want one must now consult with a health care provider, a process known as shared clinical decision-making. However, a prescription is not necessarily needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0003356nhsph25kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the change raised concerns that insurers would no longer be required to cover the full cost of the immunization. The Affordable Care Act mandates that most private insurers cover vaccines recommended by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, at no cost. Meanwhile, Medicaid’s no-cost coverage of vaccines is also tied to the committee’s recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0004356n2j3rcn2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (Medicare is required by law to cover the Covid-19 vaccine with no cost-sharing, so it is not affected by the committee’s recommendation.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0005356npitxukdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC committee’s vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms including entitlement programs such as Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, and Medicare, as well as insurance plans through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace,” a US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said in a statement last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0006356nw2yfrl0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, it may not be that cut-and-dry, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0007356nwbnu3z6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Insurers may not unanimously agree that they have to cover vaccines with shared decision-making recommendations at no cost, although the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;CDC&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has attempted to clarify that such recommendations should fall under Obamacare’s mandate, said Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. That injects “ambiguity” into the extent of the coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0008356nei4y9udk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many private insurance plans are regulated by a trio of departments: Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, which have not issued guidance on shared decision-making. Other private plans are regulated by states, at least 13 of which have taken steps to require the insurers they regulate to continue to provide Covid-19 vaccines for free to patients, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kff.org%2Fcovid-19%2Ftracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7C52f04ba9b3bd4446259a08de0502fa5b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638953707507144725%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=mfvLLlNtPvAgdgbcRznhOylLtcxHgvDlnWiYHqrpVWE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0009356nwrsxqwby@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The nation’s largest trade association for health insurers said its members – which cover more than 200 million Americans – indicated that any recommendations stemming from the committee’s meeting would not have an impact on policyholders’ coverage through the end of 2026.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000a356nepi5kh3y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement before the ACIP meeting in September that its members would continue to cover all immunizations that the committee had recommended as of September 1 at no cost to patients. This includes the updated Covid-19 vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000b356npe58kf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health plans are committed to maintaining and ensuring affordable access to vaccines,” said the association, which told CNN that shared decision-making recommendations must be covered without cost-sharing. “Health plan coverage decisions for immunizations are grounded in each plan’s ongoing, rigorous review of scientific and clinical evidence, and continual evaluation of multiple sources of data.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000c356n7r7iba53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similarly, UnitedHealthcare said it will fully cover Covid-19 vaccines recommended by ACIP as of January 1 in its standard commercial plans, although it noted that people who have certain job-based policies should check with their employers. UnitedHealthcare, which is not an AHIP member, is the nation’s largest insurer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000d356nn438vs7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “UnitedHealthcare is committed to enabling access to safe, effective and affordable care, including coverage for vaccinations,” the company said in a statement after last month’s ACIP vote. “Vaccines are an important and effective way to protect the health of individuals, families and communities, and members should talk with their health care providers to determine if a vaccine is clinically appropriate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000e356nm0l8xtvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The insurer noted that its “coverage will remain guided by federal and state mandates as well as the available clinical evidence, including the recommendations of professional societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000f356nst8qq8rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers will cover all vaccines recommended by the committee&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;January 1 with no cost to patients through the end of next year, while operating within federal and state laws, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000g356n2w6dji0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But some insurers could now argue that they aren’t mandated to pick up the entire tab for the Covid-19 vaccine, which costs about $140.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000h356nrvjcil4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s nothing that requires insurers to cover vaccines not recommended by ACIP at no cost,” Killelea said. “Where it could be ambiguous is whether all insurers will view a shared decision-making recommendation as a full recommendation from ACIP.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000i356nqnnvkfsx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medicaid enrollees will continue to receive the vaccine at no cost, per earlier guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Killelea said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000j356nd36dwl4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separately, the CDC advisory committee also voted that the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine would no longer be recommended before age 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000k356nyt0u209y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means private insurers will not be required to cover it at no cost, so if parents want their children to have the combined vaccine, they could have to pay for it – if they could get it at all, said Jen Kates, senior vice president at KFF. Vaccine makers may not continue to manufacture it, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000l356ncqkk9a1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, the combined vaccine will no longer be automatically covered by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, though states could opt to do so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000m356nub1vm3z3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC committee voted not to have the MMRV immunization covered by the Vaccines for Children program, which provides access for low-income children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000n356nudd6jyoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The separate vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella and against varicella, the virus that causes chickenpox, will continue to be recommended and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will be covered at no cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hermina Nedelescu, a neuroscientist at the institute and study co-author, added: 'It shows us which circuits are recruited when the brain links alcohol with relief from stress—and that could be a game changer in how we think about relapse.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like other drug addictions, alcohol addiction is characterised by cycles of withdrawal, sobriety and relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that when rats were initially given alcohol, they learnt to associate it with pleasure and seek more alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interestingly, the researchers noted that this connection was stronger after a few cycles of withdrawal and relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After learning that drinking eased the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal—such as loss of appetite, nausea, depression, agitation and fatigue—the rats sought out more alcohol and would remain persistent even in uncomfortable situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When rats learn to associate environmental stimuli or context with the experience of relief, they end up with an incredibly powerful urge to seek alcohol in the presence of that stimuli—even if conditions are introduced that require great effort to engage in alcohol seeking,' Prof Weiss explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That is, these rats seek alcohol even if that behaviour is punished.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that this negative reinforcement—the drive to act in order to escape pain or stress—and the activation of the PVT in the brain in response is crucial for how we learn and perpetuate addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nedelescu added: 'This work has potential applications not only for alcohol addiction, but also other disorders where people get trapped in harmful cycles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers now hope to expand the study to look at gender-specific behaviours  to pinpoint the exact molecules and neurochemicals that are involved in the brain processes driving so many people to the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weiss added: 'As psychologists, we've long known that addiction isn't just about causing pleasure—it's about escaping those negative hedonic states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study shows us where in the brain that learning takes root, which is a step forward.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest official figures shows deaths from alcohol have soared to a record high in Britain with almost 10,5000 alcohol-related deaths in 2023 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO estimate it kills three million people around the world each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS recommends people drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week—the equivalent of six pints of beer, or six medium glasses of wine—spread out over at least three days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts have recently warned that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15126395/NO-safe-alcohol-dementia-risk-experts-study.html"&gt;no amount of alcohol is 'safe'&lt;/a&gt;, adding that slashing alcohol intake could 'play a significant role in dementia prevention'.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent polls suggests that the average Briton drinks roughly 18 units of alcohol a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those concerned they may have a problem with alcohol should visit their GP, who can make an assessment and refer them to specialist clinics for counselling and help with withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, shakiness, vomiting and fast heart rate, usually resolve within a week, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular drinking has also been linked to increased risks of high blood pressure, liver disease and several cancers, according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"The front door for these viruses is our nose and that tissue right in the back of our noses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2838335"&gt;The German study of 450 adults published&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 2 found that those who took azelastine — an antihistamine sold under the brand names Astepro and Astelin — were much less likely to contract viral infections than those who took a placebo. It came after other recent research also suggested that different types of nasal sprays may prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner, who was not involved in the study, said more testing is needed, because the study involved relatively small numbers of people or were done on animals. Larger studies will determine how effective the sprays are in the real world, and at what dosages and frequencies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research over the past few years&lt;/strong&gt; has suggested that nasal sprays could help prevent COVID-19, the flu and the common cold, although larger studies are needed to confirm findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study released last month found that azelastine,&lt;/strong&gt; an antihistamine, significantly reduced the chance of getting ill from COVID-19 or the common cold. Researchers say it could potentially be used before going into high-risk situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;have been developed that, &lt;/b&gt;early research indicates, could almost fully block virus transmission. But they likely would have to be used once or multiple times a day, and experts believe people are unlikely to do that for year-round protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he said, viruses must attach to and enter cells to make you sick, and the most common entry point for respiratory viruses is the nose. Scientists believe that medications given through the nose have the potential to be more effective than those injected into the body because they attack or block the virus at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner said that &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/"&gt;Trump administration funding cutbacks and shifts&lt;/a&gt; in how it approaches COVID-19 vaccines are taking away money from nasal-spray initiatives and could delay the development of nasal vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="img Image_img__VNXHO landscape lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="Azelastine, an antihistamine, also showed promise preventing viral infections." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=828&amp;amp;q=80 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azelastine, an antihistamine, also showed promise preventing viral infections. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo/Wladimir Bulgar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those receiving azelastine in the antihistamine study used it three times a day for an average of 56 days. Researchers found they were about three times less likely to become infected with COVID-19 or with rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, than people who didn't. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32546-z"&gt;A previous, smaller study on azelastine&lt;/a&gt; had roughly similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early antihistamine doubts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines work by blocking a chemical that causes allergic symptoms. Because of that, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Medicine, said she and other physicians wondered whether antihistamines could protect against the coronavirus. But, she said, anecdotally "it did not seem to make a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What may be different today is that almost everyone has either contracted COVID-19 or received a COVID-19 vaccine, and that could lead to a different type of immune system response, Nachman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cautioned against anyone using azelastine to prevent COVID-19 or colds until after a larger study is conducted and analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have had mixed results in looking at other nasal sprays, such as those made from nitric oxide and a red seaweed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on nasal sprays is not new. There is a federally approved nasal spray — FluMist — used as a flu vaccine. It was first approved for some age groups in 2003 and is about as effective as a traditional shot, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in research into nasal sprays in recent years is in part because of efforts to find more effective vaccines against COVID-19, said Dr. Paul Spearman, vice chair for clinical and translational research and education at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe disease, but their ability to prevent transmission wanes within weeks after the shot is given, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you could make a vaccine that prevented the initial infection or prevented the spread, then that would be two steps up above what we've got now," Spearman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Promising nose gel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Boston's Brigham and Women’s Hospital last year said they developed &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/drug-free-nasal-spray-may-shield-against-respiratory-infections"&gt;a gel-like spray that coats&lt;/a&gt; the inner lining of the nose and was almost 100% effective in blocking viruses from infecting the noses of mice, and in a 3D model of the human nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is other research also looking at gels. But the gel must be reapplied to remain effective, Spearman said. In the Harvard research, it remained protective for up to eight hours. It’s unlikely most people would apply a gel every day or multiple times a day for the entire year to prevent getting a cold or COVID-19, Spearman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The azelastine findings also indicate that sustained use of the antihistamine is needed to provide protection. The study’s authors said it could be used before going into "high-risk settings, such as large gatherings or travel." But more research is needed to determine how often and for how many days it should be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spearman led &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw0896"&gt;the first U.S. human clinical trial &lt;/a&gt;of a nasal COVID-19 vaccine — released in July — that showed that people who received higher doses of the spray were significantly less likely to have COVID-19 symptoms than those getting a low dose. It was of 61 people, and a much larger study is needed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spearman said generating an immune response in the nose offers great promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you do that, then whenever the virus comes around, your immune cells just take care of it, and ideally, you'd prevent the virus from then getting into the lung or getting in anywhere else where it would make you sick," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="David Olson" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

People with this condition have a possible risk for more significant liver problems or other conditions like cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study focused on how sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages related to liver health. Based on analysis of over 103,000 participants, higher consumption of both beverage types was linked to a higher risk for MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were linked to a greater risk for liver-related mortality. While the study hasn’t been published yet, the findings shed light on the potential risks of these beverages, particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study results were presented at &lt;a href="https://ueg.eu/week" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UEG Week 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UEG Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the annual congress of United European Gastroenterology. They are yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drinking more than 1 can of any soda daily linked to liver problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective cohort study where researchers used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers examined data from 103,251 participants who did not have baseline liver disease. The median follow-up was a little over 10 years, and during this time “949 participants developed MASLD, and 103 died from liver-related causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported on their consumption of sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages. Researchers were also able to consider participants’ liver fat content based on MRI data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at the associations between drinking these beverages and someone’s risk for MASLD. They also looked at liver-related mortality and liver-fat content and their association with the related beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consuming more than 330 grams (g), or about 1 can, of drinks from either beverage category daily was associated with a higher risk for developing MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with about a 50% greater risk for MASLD, and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with 60% greater risk. The results also found that consuming either beverage type was linked to liver fat content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, drinking low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with an increased risk for liver-related mortality, but sugar-sweetened beverages did not have a significant association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the association between low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages and liver-related mortality was dose-dependent; drinking more was linked to a higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swapping soda for water helps lower liver disease risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at substituting beverages, researchers found that switching out 330 g of either beverage type daily for water helped to decrease risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect was a little larger when switching out sugar-sweetened beverages for water, which decreased MASLD risk by 14.7%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that switching out the beverage types for each other did not change the risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the potential danger of both beverages, but particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages, on liver outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lihe-Liu-2274143134" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lihe Liu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lihe Liu&lt;/a&gt;, a graduate student in the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China, explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that low- or non-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs), often seen as healthier alternatives because they use sugar substitutes, may not be entirely risk-free. We found that frequent consumption was still linked with liver health risks, which challenges the common belief that these drinks are completely ‘safe’ or ‘healthy’ substitutes for sugary beverages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study limitations and continued research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, which makes it challenging to know the full limitations of the research. However, beverage intake was something reported by participants, which may not have been their true intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also does not establish that consumption of these beverages causes liver problems. It’s also unclear what covariates researchers adjusted for in their analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank is has its own limitations too, including the fact that it includes &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:primarily white participants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;primarily white participants&lt;/a&gt;, and they tend to be healthier than the United Kingdom’s general population. For this reason, additional follow-up research will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Liu explained the next steps to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, saying that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to complete and submit the full manuscript for peer review and publication, which will allow the scientific community to scrutinize and build upon our findings. Looking ahead, more research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms linking artificially sweetened beverages to liver disease, and to explore whether different types of sweeteners carry different risks. Long-term studies in more diverse populations will also be important to strengthen the evidence base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the clinical implications?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is required, the findings do give another reason for avoiding drinks like soda and their diet counterparts. It also highlights that opting for water instead may help to decrease MASLD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks may carry risks for liver health. Clinically, this highlights the need to guide people toward healthier beverage choices, with water remaining the safest and healthiest option,” Liu explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.eatwell2livebetter.com/about.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karen Z.

And the potential side effects are related to the fact that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; so powerful, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not everyone who takes GLP-1s will have side effects, some will, and they can range from mild to life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, doctors share the most common side effects of GLP-1 medications and how best to avoid these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vomiting, nausea and other gastrointestinal issues are common.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most commonly reported side effects are GI-related: nausea, constipation, loose stools, vomiting,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these don’t happen to everyone. In clinical trials, nausea was the most commonly reported side effect and impacted 44% of people, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These meds are mimicking a natural hormone [GLP-1] and amplifying it ... so, you can imagine it will impact people differently, because just how sensitive you are to these hormones. So the side effects that are most common are related to the impact of the medication [and] the impact it has on the movement of the food,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication slows down the movement of food through your gut, Parrella said, which makes the above gastrointestinal symptoms common, in addition to things such as acid reflux, heartburn and burping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dehydration and a lack of nutrients can happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people who take GLP-1s don’t get hunger and thirst signals as often as they would off of the medication, Lofton said. While this is a common occurrence, it can lead to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some individuals, they might not be eating enough or drinking enough fluids, so it can cause risks related to dehydration or not having enough electrolytes, or possibly not eating enough nutrients, such as protein or fiber,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often get fuller faster, which leads to less food consumption and, in turn, fewer necessary nutrients, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are more serious adverse effects, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the [adverse] effects that people will talk about ... would be pancreatitis, and that’s an inflammation in the pancreas. ... This medication is intended to make your pancreas work a little bit [harder], so that it pumps out more insulin when you eat foods that increase blood glucose,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, basically, the starchy carbs and the sugary foods, if you eat those, your pancreas has to work harder with these medications, and it pumps out a lot more insulin than usual,” she noted. This overactivity can cause pancreatitis in some people, Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallstones and gallbladder inflammation are also associated with the use of GLP-1s, Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, if someone vomits too much, they become dehydrated, which can cause kidney failure,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal obstruction can also occur, which is when “food stops moving through because it gets stuck,” Parrella said. Dehydration and a lack of movement of the gut can cause this food pileup, Parrella noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all health issues that require immediate medical attention, but confusingly, the signs of these problems often overlap with some of the less serious side effects of GLP-1s — vomiting, nausea, indigestion and more — both doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also this very small but serious risk of what’s called gastroparesis, which is basically where your stomach stops moving the food forward,” Parrella said. This is a permanent issue that isn’t fixed when someone stops taking the medication, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://federal-lawyer.com/injury-lawsuit/ozempic/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="There is currently litigation" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://federal-lawyer.com/injury-lawsuit/ozempic/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;There is currently litigation&lt;/a&gt; around this issue and lots of medical concerns, as it’s hard to predict who this may happen to, Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;GLP-1 medications such as Wegovy and Ozempic can cause side effects including vomiting, nausea, gum disease and more.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can cause dental decay and gum disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-walton-522b4826" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Elizabeth Walton" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-walton-522b4826" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Walton&lt;/a&gt;, clinical director at &lt;a href="https://risasdental.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Risas Kids Dental" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://risasdental.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Risas Kids Dental&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to dental health, the most common side effects of the use of GLP-1s are an increase in gum disease and dental decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medications reduce saliva production. “Patients taking GLP-1s often experience symptoms of dry mouth, which include increased cavities and periodontal disease,” Walton told HuffPost via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Saliva produces a protective barrier over our teeth and lubricates our [gums],” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With less saliva in our mouths, we are more exposed to the acids created by bacteria that lead to gum disease and dental cavities,” noted Walton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any side effects, you should let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell my patients if they have vomiting even once, they should call my office because vomiting can be a symptom of some of the other more dangerous adverse effects,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms persist or get worse, you should certainly tell your doctor, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the side effects of these medications are sometimes talked about among those on GLP-1s, it doesn’t make them normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people will say, ‘I’m just going to suck it up. I know nausea is normal,’ or ‘I know it’s common to have constipation on these meds. This is probably no big deal. It’s just how these meds work,’ or ‘I’m worried my doctor will stop prescribing this medicine for me if I complain’ ... and that’s when it becomes a problem,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When symptoms continue or worsen, it’s a sign from the body that something is wrong, she noted. “And when we ignore that, or don’t report, it then becomes very difficult to prevent the longer, more serious problems,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To combat some of these symptoms, you should follow a few rules when taking this medication.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you focus on drinking lots of fluids and staying hydrated as you take GLP-1s, Parrella said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, you should prioritize your protein intake so you can maintain and build muscle as you are on the medication, she said. To further help muscle growth and maintenance, add strength training to your workout regimen, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then the third thing would be, because this slows the movement of food through the gut, you want to make sure you stop eating three [to four] hours before bedtime,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you lie down after eating, it’s easy for the food to come back up and cause issues like heartburn and acid reflux, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There isn’t long-term research on GLP-1s, so some of the risks are unknown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important if somebody does start experiencing some new symptoms of any kind on these medications, we have to remember we don’t have very long-term data on these meds, so there are still a lot of unknown risks with these medications,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do they cause cancer? What happens if you stop? Does it cause a metabolic rebound? What about interactions with populations outside of those who have been tested?” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medical professionals are excited about understanding this new space in medicine, it’s also important that those who use GLP-1s remain cautious and informed of the risks, benefits and proper usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You also have to pay attention to the effect on your own body. So, if you don’t feel good, or you are having symptoms of any kind, be in communication with your doctor so that you have a partner in the process,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you should consider the risk versus the benefit when it comes to GLP-1s (and all medications), Lofton said. “This comes into play when we think about people who aren’t having a weight condition,” Lofton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Image credit: SKC/Stocksy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet versions of beverages are often hailed as healthier than the sugar-sweetened original versions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research is ongoing regarding the potential dangers of sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent study results identified a link between drinking higher amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study focused on how sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages related to liver health. Based on analysis of over 103,000 participants, higher consumption of both beverage types was linked to a higher risk for MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were linked to a greater risk for liver-related mortality. While the study hasn’t been published yet, the findings shed light on the potential risks of these beverages, particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study results were presented at &lt;a href="https://ueg.eu/week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UEG Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the annual congress of United European Gastroenterology. They are yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective cohort study where researchers used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers examined data from 103,251 participants who did not have baseline liver disease. The median follow-up was a little over 10 years, and during this time “949 participants developed MASLD, and 103 died from liver-related causes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported on their consumption of sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages. Researchers were also able to consider participants’ liver fat content based on MRI data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at the associations between drinking these beverages and someone’s risk for MASLD. They also looked at liver-related mortality and liver-fat content and their association with the related beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consuming more than 330 grams (g), or about 1 can, of drinks from either beverage category daily was associated with a higher risk for developing MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with about a 50% greater risk for MASLD, and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with 60% greater risk. The results also found that consuming either beverage type was linked to liver fat content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, drinking low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with an increased risk for liver-related mortality, but sugar-sweetened beverages did not have a significant association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the association between low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages and liver-related mortality was dose-dependent; drinking more was linked to a higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at substituting beverages, researchers found that switching out 330 g of either beverage type daily for water helped to decrease risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect was a little larger when switching out sugar-sweetened beverages for water, which decreased MASLD risk by 14.7%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that switching out the beverage types for each other did not change the risk for MASLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the potential danger of both beverages, but particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages, on liver outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lihe-Liu-2274143134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Lihe Liu&lt;/a&gt;, a graduate student in the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China, explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that low- or non-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs), often seen as healthier alternatives because they use sugar substitutes, may not be entirely risk-free. We found that frequent consumption was still linked with liver health risks, which challenges the common belief that these drinks are completely ‘safe’ or ‘healthy’ substitutes for sugary beverages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, which makes it challenging to know the full limitations of the research. However, beverage intake was something reported by participants, which may not have been their true intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also does not establish that consumption of these beverages causes liver problems. It’s also unclear what covariates researchers adjusted for in their analyses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank is has its own limitations too, including the fact that it includes &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;primarily white participants&lt;/a&gt;, and they tend to be healthier than the United Kingdom’s general population. For this reason, additional follow-up research will be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Liu explained the next steps to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, saying that: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to complete and submit the full manuscript for peer review and publication, which will allow the scientific community to scrutinize and build upon our findings. Looking ahead, more research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms linking artificially sweetened beverages to liver disease, and to explore whether different types of sweeteners carry different risks. Long-term studies in more diverse populations will also be important to strengthen the evidence base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is required, the findings do give another reason for avoiding drinks like soda and their diet counterparts. It also highlights that opting for water instead may help to decrease MASLD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks may carry risks for liver health. Clinically, this highlights the need to guide people toward healthier beverage choices, with water remaining the safest and healthiest option,” Liu explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.eatwell2livebetter.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Karen Z. Berg&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CSO, CDN, who was not involved in this research, advised that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people have the misconception that diet drinks are healthier for you than regular drinks, but this study demonstrates how both are positively associated with MASLD. I highly encourage all patients to stick with water, or carbonated water, for the best health outcomes. Just because something says ‘zero calories’ or ‘less sugar’ [it] does not automatically equate with [being] healthier. There are a lot of chemicals that go into those beverages to give them the flavors people crave. Plain water, fruit infused water (homemade), unsweetened homemade iced tea, or seltzer [are] the way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 10:52:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTi02VW04VzVLc25ILTBsQTdkZzdDS1lnaWQ0Y3lxWWVtS3UwOTNQMll2X0FKVEsyUG9SOXRyWmhiRmxCTmZYM1NULWpSUE9naHlIcmQ5bDBXb1VRd3JuZDZIYXdMeENBZHNtaWlPYzR3X1hfc1VMYTI0NzhaNFJ3cVZMZk05RFA2cjdWSUo1MHUxSU9zS2tr</guid></item><item><title>甜味剂和甜度增强剂对超重或肥胖个体体重管理和肠道微生物群组成的影响： SWEET研究-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01381-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec13-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14"&gt;Ethics statement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04226911"&gt;NCT04226911&lt;/a&gt;), was approved by national ethical committees (protocols and amendments) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

All participants provided written informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec15"&gt;Trial design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SWEET trial was a two-armed parallel group RCT conducted at four intervention sites: Athens (Harokopio University of Athens, Greece), Copenhagen (University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Maastricht (Maastricht University, the Netherlands) and Pamplona (University of Navarra, Spain), effectively covering northern, central, southern and south-eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1-year RCT consisted of an initial 2-month weight loss period followed by a 10-month, randomized, two-armed parallel WM period. The full 1-year trial on which the majority of outcomes are reported (months M0–M12) comprises the combined periods and is thus termed WM. For adults, the goal was first to achieve a weight loss of ≥5% of the initial weight and second, to maintain their new body weight. For children, the first goal was to achieve weight stability and second, to maintain their BMI-for-age &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score. CIDs were carried out at baseline (M0), after weight loss and weight stability (M2) and twice during WM (M6 and M12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec16"&gt;Participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 341 adults and 38 children were included in the trial (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01381-z#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). The analysis of gut microbiota composition was done in a subgroup of 137 adult completers. Participants were enrolled between June 2020 and October 2021.

In brief, 18–65-year-old men and women (self-reported sex) with BMI ≥ 25 kg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and 6–12-year-old boys and girls (self-reported sex) with a BMI-for-age of &amp;gt;85th percentile were included. Children were included in a family setting with at least one recruited parent. Participants were required to have a regular consumption of sugar-containing or sugar-sweetened products. Adult participants were excluded at screening if, for example, they had been surgically treated for obesity, were taking medication affecting body weight, had been diagnosed with diabetes, had a fasting glucose &amp;gt;7.0 mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or had systolic blood pressure of &amp;gt;160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of &amp;gt;100 mmHg. Children were excluded if, for example, they performed &amp;gt;10 h of intensive physical training per week, had self-reported eating disorders, were diagnosed with diabetes or used medication that affected their body weight. All adults received low-energy diet products free of charge. Participants in Copenhagen, Pamplona and Athens did not receive reimbursement for their participation; travel expenses and financial compensation were provided for participants in Maastricht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17"&gt;Intervention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial lasted 1 year for each participant. The first CID (M0) was on 24 August 2020, and the last participant’s final visit (M12) was on 6 October 2022. During the initial 2-month period, adults—regardless of randomization—received the low-energy diet (Cambridge Weight Plan). For children, weight stability should be achieved by following the dietary recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics on the prevention, assessment and treatment of overweight and obesity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Kjølbæk, L. et al.

All participants were randomly allocated to one of two diet groups in a 1:1 ratio by a site-specific, computerized randomization list created by a person in Copenhagen not involved in the RCT. Stratification was done by sex, age (&amp;lt;40 or ≥40 years) and BMI (&amp;lt;30 or ≥30 kg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) in blocks of four. Each household, including children, was randomized to the same intervention group determined by the oldest member of the household. If there was more than one eligible child per household, it was still the randomization group of the oldest adult participant that determined the child allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although randomization was done after inclusion (at screening), it was not revealed to the participants before completion of the 2-month weight loss or weight stability period. The two ad libitum intervention diets were a healthy diet with &amp;lt;10 E% added sugar, allowing foods and drinks with all types of S&amp;amp;SE products commercially available (S&amp;amp;SEs group), and a healthy diet with &amp;lt;10 E% added sugar, not allowing S&amp;amp;SE products (sugar group). The maximum allowed sugar intake was calculated individually at M2 and recalculated at M6 and then converted to a simple trial-specific unit system (one unit = 10 g sugar). The participants received their maximum unit intake and lists with sugar-rich products, including the unit content. Lists were divided into different categories; for example, drinks, breakfast or desserts. The lists also provided a corresponding product with S&amp;amp;SEs (similar in weight or volume; details described elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Kjølbæk, L. et al.

For the S&amp;amp;SEs group, the aim was to replace as many sugar-containing products as possible with S&amp;amp;SEs products, whereas S&amp;amp;SEs products were not allowed in the sugar group. S&amp;amp;SEs included high-potency sweeteners (for example, aspartame, acesulfame-K, saccharin, thaumatin, neotame, stevia glycosides), polyols (for example, erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol), slowly digestible carbohydrates (for example, sucromalt, isomaltulose) and sweet fibres or oligosaccharides (inulin-type oligosaccharides). Owing to the characteristics of the trial, blinding was not possible, but all efforts to blind trial staff taking measurements and doing statistical analyses were made. During the intervention period, participants were supervised by dieticians at least every third month. The goal for adults was to maintain weight loss, and for children, the goal was to maintain BMI-for-age &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score. Further reduction in body weight or BMI-for-age &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score was allowed if the participant was compliant with the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18"&gt;Data collection and outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were collected according to common standard operating procedures, which were used in all intervention sites. Most data were collected at the CIDs after ≥10 h of overnight fast. All data were stored in a central data hub in Copenhagen, from which pseudo-anonymized data can be requested until 2032 through a data-sharing contract. As of 2032, fully anonymized data can be transferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Primary outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar1"&gt;Body weight&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital scale, with participants wearing underwear or light clothes. Fasting body weight was measured at screening and CIDs, but fasting was not required at other visits.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar2"&gt;Gut microbiota composition&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Participants were selected based on whether they completed the full intervention and whether faecal spot samples were available at all time points. The participants were stratified based on age, sex and centre. Faecal spot samples were collected and immediately frozen (−20 °C) at home by the participants before all CIDs. At CIDs, the faecal spot samples were stored at −80 °C at the intervention sites. Barcoded amplicons from the V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA genes (341 F, 5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′; 785 R, 5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) were generated using the Illumina two-step PCR protocol, and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq with the paired-end (2×) 300 bp protocol (Nextera XT index kit). After each PCR step, the products were purified (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit), the size of the PCR products was checked on a fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and concentration was quantified by fluorometric analysis (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit). For genomic DNA isolation, QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kits (Qiagen) were used. All outcomes were determined at M0, M2, M6 and M12. Stool consistency was assessed using BSS for each sample&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Lewis, S. &amp;amp; Heaton, K.

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar3"&gt;Anthropometry and body composition&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The methods for measuring anthropometry (BMI, waist and hip circumference) and body composition (fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass and computed visceral adipose tissue (CoreScan software; Encore v.17.0) using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) have been extensively described elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Kjølbæk, L. et al.

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar4"&gt;Risk factors for T2D and CVD&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Risk factors for T2D include elevated levels of glucose, insulin and HbA1c; for CVD, risk factors include high cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and high blood pressure. During CIDs, fasting venous blood samples were drawn. Whole blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes for HbA1c analysis and immediately stored locally at −80 °C. Blood samples were collected in serum separator tubes for analyses of lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C and HDL-C) and insulin. Whole blood samples with fluoride were collected for glucose analysis, with EDTA for CCK, GLP-1 and EDTA plus aprotinin for ghrelin analysis. All blood samples were centrifuged at 1,500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (serum or plasma) samples were aliquoted and stored locally at −80 °C until shipment to the central lab at Bioiatriki (Athens). Glucose concentration was measured by the enzymatic Hexokinase/G-6-PD method (Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit 07P55, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser (a clinical chemistry analyser from Abbott). A conversion factor for glucose, from mg dl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 0.0555. Insulin concentration was measured by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Alinity i Insulin Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity i analyser (immunoassay analyser from Abbott). A conversion factor for insulin, from µIU ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 6. HbA1c was measured by an enzymatic assay (Alinity c Haemoglobin A1c Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser, clinical chemistry (Abbott). One participant had results below the lower detection limit during two CIDs. These latter results were reported as 5.0%. Total cholesterol was measured by an enzymatic assay (Alinity c Cholesterol Reagent kit (Abbott)), and LDL-C and HDL-C were measured by liquid (Alinity c Direct LDL Reagent kit) and accelerator (Alinity c Ultra HDL Reagent kit) selective detergent methods, respectively (both Abbott). All cholesterol concentrations were analysed using an Alinity c analyser. A conversion factor for cholesterol (total, LDL and HDL), from mg dl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 0.02586. Triglycerides were measured by a glycerol phosphate oxidase method (Alinity c Triglyceride Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser. A conversion factor for triglycerides, from mg dl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 0.01129. CCK was measured by a competitive enzyme immunoassay method (RayBio Human CCK Enzyme Immunoassay kit, RayBiotech) using a BioTek Quant analyser (BioTek Instruments). Two participants had results above the range of quantification (4,000 pg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) during two CIDs, and their CCK results were reported as 4,000 pg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar5"&gt;IHL content&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;IHL content was analysed in a subgroup (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 27) of adults at Maastricht (S&amp;amp;SEs group, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15; sugar group, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 12). Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS) was performed using a 3T MR system (Achieva 3T-X Philips Healthcare) at M0, M2 and M12. A 32-channel sense cardiac/torso coil (Philips Healthcare) was used, and a 30 × 30 × 30 mm voxel was placed in the lower hepatic lobe. The STEAM (repetition time, 4,500 ms; echo time, 20 ms; number of signal averages, 128) sequence was used, as described previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="Roumans, K. et al.

VAPOR water suppression was applied, and an additional water reference scan was obtained (number of signal averages, 16). A custom-written MATLAB script (MATLAB 2014b, The MathWorks) was used to post-process the spectra. Phasing, frequency alignment and eddy current correction were all performed on spectra before signal averaging. CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resonance, as a percentage of the sum of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O resonances (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + water)), was used as a parameter of IHL content.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar6"&gt;Changes in (serious) AEs and concomitant medication use&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Any experienced (serious) AEs or changes in medication use were registered during the CIDs. During the WM period, the participants were asked, regardless of intervention, directly about AEs potentially related to the consumption of S&amp;amp;SEs, including gastrointestinal symptoms and headache.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Other outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective appetite sensations over the last 7 days were reported in a questionnaire delivery platform on-site or at home within ±7 days of each CID. The participants answered five questions: (1) how strong was your desire to eat savoury foods; (2) how strong was your desire to eat sweet foods; (3) how satiated have you felt; (4) how hungry have you felt; and (5) how full have you felt? All questions were developed in English and translated into the local language at each site. A visual analogue scale with extremes anchored at each end (0, not at all; 100, extremely) was used. Depending on the device that was used, lines were not necessarily 10 cm long, but the rating was presented as a percentage; for example, a mark at 4 cm on an 8 cm line would correspond to 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Compliance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess compliance, participants completed 4-day weighed records of all foods and drinks (three weekdays and one weekend day) at M0 and M12. Only records of a minimum of 3 days were deemed valid and used for further analysis. Daily average intake of energy and macronutrients was calculated by national dietary software at the four intervention sites.

Furthermore, the database was updated with nutritional information of processed foods provided by independent research institutes, food companies and fast-food chains. In Pamplona, food records were manually entered in the online application Nutrium (Nutrium.com), which is based on two food databases (BEDCA &amp;amp; CESNID from Spain and the US Department of Agriculture).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, intake (g) of products with sugar and S&amp;amp;SEs and the corresponding units were estimated.

After correction for dilution, urinary concentrations (ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) were multiplied by 24 h urine volume and converted to daily excretions (mg day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Urinary urea concentration was analysed locally and converted to daily urinary nitrogen excretion (g day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) by multiplying urea excretion (g day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) by 0.4664. At Copenhagen and Maastricht, urea was measured by an enzymatic UV test (colourimetry) (ABX Pentra Urea CP, Horiba ABX) using an ABX Pentra 400. At Harokopio, urea was measured by an enzymatic colourimetric (Urease) Alinity c Urea Nitrogen Reagent kit (Abbott Laboratories). At Pamplona, urea was measured by an enzymatic kinetic test (COBAS 8000, Roche Diagnostics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the per-protocol population, participants’ compliance was estimated using points (minimum zero points and maximum four points) in relation to four criteria: intake of sugar units and S&amp;amp;SE units and urinary excretion of S&amp;amp;SEs at M6 and at M12. In three out of the four criteria, 75% of the group with the highest (&amp;gt;Q1) or lowest (&amp;lt;Q3) value—depending on the outcome assessed—received one point, and the remaining 25% received no points.

It was estimated that a mean difference of 1.5 kg, with a s.d. of ±3.5 kg, 90% power and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, would require 231 completers. With an estimated dropout of 30%, a minimum of 330 adult participants should be included (approximately 25% per intervention site). The sample size for the 1-year change in gut microbiota required a minimum of 100 participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 50 per intervention group) and was based on a calculation taking into account ~10% change in 20 of the 50 most abundant operational taxonomic units with an alpha of &amp;lt;0.05%.

The trial was not powered to analyse data from men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change in body weight was calculated as the difference between M0 and M12 (M12 − M0). For the primary ITT analysis, the population was defined as all randomized participants who obtained the required ≥5% weight loss at M2. For the ITT analysis, missing data (that is, body weight at M12) were imputed as the last observation carried forward. The analysis of differences between the groups was conducted using an ANCOVA linear mixed model, with individual change in body weight as the response, and intervention group, baseline body weight, age, sex and site as fixed effects. Additionally, a complete-case analysis (all dropouts omitted) and a per-protocol analysis (only compliant participants defined by the point scoring system) were analysed with the same ANCOVA model. Finally, adult body weight was analysed with the inclusion of all visits (time points) as a linear mixed-effect model with repeated measurements. This analysis had body weight as the response variable and included the fixed effects time-intervention interaction, age, sex and baseline body weight. Site and participants were included as random effects. If there was a significant interaction, post hoc tests were conducted with the R extension package ‘emmeans’ to calculate the estimated marginal mean and s.e.m. at each time point for comparison of the groups. This model was also used to impute missing body weight values for post hoc ITT analyses. For secondary outcomes on continuous data, the main analysis compared the 6-month and 12-month mean changes between the treatment groups by use of the ANCOVA linear mixed model defined above, without imputation of missing values (that is, complete-case analyses). All models were graphically checked by residual plots and quantile–quantile plots to assess model assumptions, mainly the normality assumption, and when relevant, transformed (for example, by logarithm). Furthermore, Poisson regression analysis was used to analyse the predictive effect of group intervention on reported AEs and concomitant medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Microbiota analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete microbiota data processing and analysis pipeline is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/AlexanderUm/SWEET_microbiome"&gt;https://github.com/AlexanderUm/SWEET_microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.

No gyms. No studios. Just a yoga mat and free YouTube workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a year, I lost 100 pounds—weight I’d carried most of my life. The change is the result of a gradual layering of habits—first a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/high-protein-tiktok-recipes/"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt; diet, then online workouts, followed by walking and running, and eventually intermittent fasting. But the real transformation wasn’t just physical. Somewhere along the way, I built something harder to measure: a healing relationship with movement. For the first time, exercise wasn’t about shrinking. I was expanding into myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I took that newfound confidence outside. I dreamed of being one of those amateur runners crossing the Boston Marathon finish line while the city collectively thawed from another long, gray winter. There was just one problem: I hated running. The poignant burn of shin splints. The sharp gasps for air. The way my lungs felt like they were being folded into origami. It was clear that no matter how badly I wanted to become a runner, my body wasn’t on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But walking? Walking was having a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/wellness/walking-popularity-comeback-coronavirus"&gt;cultural moment&lt;/a&gt;—digital creator &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.instagram.com/mia__lind/?hl=en"&gt;Mia Lind&lt;/a&gt; was actively promoting her now-famous &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://hotgirlwalk.com/pages/our-story"&gt;Hot Girl Walk&lt;/a&gt;—and I was more than ready to hop on that bandwagon. I bought ankle weights (these &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener nofollow" data-afl-p="1" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ankle-Weights-Set-0-5lb-Cuffs/dp/B013HJOYPM?tag=outsideonlinedotcom-20"&gt;two-pound weights&lt;/a&gt; are my favorite), mapped out a 2.5-mile loop, and walked every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think of walking as a consolation prize—the thing you did when you couldn’t run. I couldn’t imagine going from an 8:10 pace to genuinely enjoying what felt like a 24-minute mile—the kind of slow movement where my Apple Watch buzzes to ask me if I’ve stopped moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to May of this year, and a new walking trend has captured our attention: Japanese walking. In a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKLIdteTrQA/"&gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt;, fitness coach Eugene Teo explains this method of interval-style walking, which involves alternating between walking fast for three minutes and walking slow for three minutes, for five sets in half an hour. The goal? Metabolic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to believe walking only counted if I hit 10,000 steps a day. But over the past few years, as walking has shifted from a cooldown to the centerpiece of the wellness conversation, I’ve realized that isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;10,000 Steps a Day—the Rule We Didn’t Question&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I ever mapped out my walking loop, I thought 10,000 steps was a rule. Not a suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lived everywhere: embedded in my fitness tracker, baked into my phone’s health app, echoed in friends’ attempts to “close their rings.” It felt like the adult version of eating your vegetables. You just did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what no one tells you. Ten thousand steps didn’t come from science. It came from a pedometer ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-1960s Japan, amid a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/increased-focus-on-sport-benefits-for-public-health"&gt;national fitness push&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, exercise physiologist Yoshiro Hatano estimated that doubling the average person’s daily steps—from about 4,000 to 10,000—“&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200434010-00001"&gt;would result in an increased energy expenditure of about 300 kcal/day.&lt;/a&gt;” There were no clinical trials. No test subjects. Just back-of-the-envelope energy math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6547157/"&gt;Yamasa&lt;/a&gt;, the company known for its delicious soy sauces, released a pedometer called the manpo-kei (万歩計)—which literally translates to “10,000 steps meter.” The number wasn’t precise. But it was motivational, and so it stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2015 book &lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener nofollow" data-afl-p="1" href="https://www.amazon.com/Health-Trackers-Technology-Helping-Monitor/dp/144225355X?tag=outsideonlinedotcom-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Trackers: How Technology Is Helping Us Monitor and Improve Our Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, technology journalist Richard MacManus describes how Japanese companies, such as Coca-Cola Japan and the green tea brand Ito En,&lt;/span&gt; distributed pedometers as part of large-scale marketing campaigns. These giveaways weren’t just promotions; they reinforced 10,000 steps per day as a public health guideline, embedding it into daily routines and branding it as common sense. What began as a marketing device was quietly becoming a cultural standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That foundation set the stage for one of Silicon Valley’s most iconic inventions—the FitBit. When Fitbit launched in 2009, it put 10,000 steps as the default daily goal—not because medical science required it, but because decades of repetition had already made it &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; official. Fitbit’s own Help Center confirms: “The &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236510?hl=en&amp;amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com#zippy=%2Cwhich-core-stats-does-my-fitbit-device-track-automatically%2Ccan-i-change-my-activity-goal-on-my-fitbit-device"&gt;default daily step goal&lt;/a&gt; is 10,000 steps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other wearables—like those from Apple, Garmin, and Samsung—gave steps prominent placement, even when their dashboards focused more on metrics like calories burned or active minutes. By then, steps had become the clearest, most shareable proof of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Quiet Resistance Embedded in Japanese Walking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10,000-step rule didn’t begin as a mandate; it started as a story—a round number, wrapped in optimism. Like most stories, it’s worth asking, &lt;em&gt;What happens when you stop believing it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question is what led me to try Japanese Interval Walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it appears to be just another niche trend. But the more I read, the more it felt like quiet resistance—a method grounded in rhythm, not accumulation—a counterpoint to Western fitness culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Benefits of Japanese Walking, According to Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, exercise physiologist Dr. Hiroshi Nose and his team at Shinshu University in Japan developed Interval Walking Training (IWT), a deceptively simple yet highly effective protocol specifically designed for aging populations. Walk fast, then slow, three minutes each, five times per walking session, at least four days each week. No wearables. No tracking apps required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/148769277?utm_source=linkout"&gt;five-month randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; involving 246 older adults, IWT outperformed moderate-intensity continuous walking and sedentary control groups. Participants in the IWT group experienced a ten percent increase in peak aerobic capacity (&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/vo2-max-brain/"&gt;VO₂ max&lt;/a&gt;), as well as a 13- and 17-percent increase in quadriceps and hamstring strength, respectively. A reduction in systolic blood pressure was another benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285762"&gt;Broader reviews&lt;/a&gt; associate IWT with significant gains in fitness, muscle strength, and glycemic stability in individuals with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Japanese Walking Focuses on Effort, Not Step Count&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprises me most is how differently IWT frames the idea of progress. It’s not about pushing harder, going longer, or obsessing over streaks. Instead, IWT asks for attention, not intensity; presence, not performance. You don’t need to post your workout stats or chase medals. You just need to show up, breathe a little harder, and let your body remember how to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about what you can post—but how you feel when you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That philosophy sits in sharp contrast to step-count culture, where success is visible, measurable, and shareable, where the end goal is often less about how your body feels and more about whether your tracker vibrates in approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, IWT isn’t a magic bullet. The Shinshu University training method focused on a fairly specific group—healthy, older Japanese adults—which makes it harder to say how the protocol translates across more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the encouraging part, per the Shinsu study: even when participants didn’t hit every target, they still saw meaningful gains in blood pressure, aerobic capacity, and strength. In other words, you don’t have to be perfect for IWT to work—you just have to show up often enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a culture that equates health with hustle, that quiet efficiency is the most radical act of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But structure isn’t the only way intention can take shape. While some walks are designed for blood pressure management, others are curated for presence and joy. If IWT is a quiet rebellion against numbers, the Hot Girl Walk is a bold reimagination—and both challenge what progress is supposed to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Many Steps Should You Walk Every Day?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because walking stopped being something you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; and evolved into something you tracked, shared, and proved, step count signaled effort, discipline, even virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the number was never required. It turns out that you don’t need 10,000 steps to be healthy. Not even close, in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study in &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31141585/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that for older women, health benefits began to appear around 4,400 steps and plateaued at 7,500 steps. A &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35247352/"&gt;2022 &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that 6,000 to 8,000 steps were adequate for most older adults, with younger adults typically plateauing closer to the 10,000-step count.

&lt;p&gt;So why does the 10,000-step rule endure? Because it feels complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral psychologists refer to this phenomenon as the “round number effect”—our instinctive attraction to clean, whole figures. Buzzes, badges, and streaks turned it into more than a goal. It became proof of doing wellness right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the number becomes the focus, quality is often lost. A leisurely 10,000-step stroll might do less for your heart than 4,000 brisk ones—but your app rewards both the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I walked, the more I realized the act itself is simple—but the meaning we attach to it rarely is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, walking offers structure. A measured, repeatable ritual. For others, it’s a mood, an aesthetic, a way to step into confidence. And for many, it’s just a number—a goal preloaded into a wristband, quietly urging us to try harder. Each of these approaches reflects not just a style of movement, but a worldview. A belief about what counts. What’s worth tracking? What progress looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These paths don’t compete so much as coexist. But they do ask different things of us. Some ask for precision. Others, presence. Others still, proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the meaning of walking didn’t arrive all at once. It unfolded slowly—on cold mornings, on sidewalks slick with slush, through half-smiles exchanged with strangers I’d never know by name. In moments when no one was watching, and I wasn’t performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What started for me as a 2.5-mile loop with ankle weights and a podcast became a daily invitation: to listen to my body. To loosen my grip on old goals. To move for the sake of moving, not for the data I could collect or the image I could project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shift didn’t erase ambition or discipline—it redefined them. It reminded me that movement doesn’t have to equate to an arbitrary round number to be meaningful. It doesn’t need to be validated by a graph or broadcast in an Instagram caption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the most radical thing you can do is move without trying to make it count.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? &lt;a href="#Section1"&gt;Let us know!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-education-nutrition-medical-training-reforms.html"&gt;recently demanded&lt;/a&gt; that medical schools teach nutrition, and that the organizations in charge of medical education standards had two weeks to come up with plans to teach it, and include it in licensing exams and residency requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two local medical schools say they’re ready — because they have included nutrition as part of their curricula for years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drexel University’s nutrition curriculum dates back to the late 1990s, said &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/medicine/faculty/profiles/michael-white/"&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of pharmacology and physiology at the Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. Medical students spend around 20 hours of class time learning about topics like vitamins, food labels, and how to assess a patient’s energy and nutrition needs to have proper food for them during hospital stays.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given how much nutrition we already cover, we don’t have much to worry about with that declaration from HHS and the Department of Education,” he said.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He added that the medical school faculty at Drexel considers nutrition to be an important part of health, which is why the program has had it as part of its curriculum for so many years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper Medical School at Rowan University in New Jersey not only teaches nutrition across various courses, the school also has research projects and community service projects focused on nutrition, said &lt;a href="https://cmsru.rowan.edu/about/leadership-team/sangita-phadtare.html"&gt;Sangita Phadtare&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant dean and professor of biomedical sciences at the university.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, students participate in a local community garden to grow fresh vegetables, and they also worked with a local community group to explain to Spanish-speaking residents how to interpret food labels, and how diabetes patients can build healthy meals from dollar-store foods like dried beans and frozen vegetables, if they don’t have cars.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a school, we try to do our part because we believe that Camden is our home. It’s not just our workplace,” Phadtare said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though I would say that we fare well, there is always scope for doing more,” she added. “We personally, as a medical education community, think that nutrition in medical education is important. And even without anybody telling us that, we should be doing that.”

Fewer than 2% of them had ever discussed menopause with their dentist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And at her most recent appointment?

This is especially true for Long COVID, a chronic condition that can develop after COVID-19 that causes a variety of lasting symptoms. Among the most common and debilitating of these is cognitive impairment, often referred to as "brain fog," which affects over 80% of people with Long COVID. Given the hundreds of millions of global cases, Long COVID represents a massive public health and socioeconomic challenge, as it severely impacts people's ability to work and perform daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of Long COVID and brain fog remain poorly understood. Previous imaging studies have shown some structural changes in the brain, but they could not pinpoint the molecular dysfunctions responsible for the cognitive symptoms. Since it's difficult to observe the molecules that govern communication between brain cells directly, researchers are left without objective biomarkers to confirm a Long COVID diagnosis or develop therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, a research team led by Professor Takuya Takahashi from the Graduate School of Medicine at Yokohama City University, Japan, has made a significant breakthrough in understanding the cause of Long COVID brain fog. As explained in their paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; on October 1, 2025, the team hypothesized that patients with brain fog might exhibit disrupted expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) -- key molecules for memory and learning -- based on prior research into psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Thus, they used a novel method called [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]K-2 AMPAR PET imaging to directly visualize and quantify the density of AMPARs in the living human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing imaging data from 30 patients with Long COVID to 80 healthy individuals, the researchers found a notable and widespread increase in the density of AMPARs across the brains of patients. This elevated receptor density was directly correlated with the severity of their cognitive impairment, suggesting a clear link between these molecular changes and the symptoms. Additionally, the concentrations of various inflammatory markers were also correlated with AMPAR levels, indicating a possible interaction between inflammation and receptor expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study's findings represent a crucial step forward in addressing many unresolved issues regarding Long COVID. The systemic increase in AMPARs provides a direct biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, highlighting a target for potential treatments. For example, drugs that suppress AMPAR activity could be a viable approach to mitigate brain fog. Interestingly, the team's analysis also demonstrated that imaging data can be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. "&lt;em&gt;By applying our newly developed AMPA receptor PET imaging technology, we aim to provide a novel perspective and innovative solutions to the pressing medical challenge that is Long COVID,&lt;/em&gt;" remarks Prof. Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While further efforts will be needed to find a definitive solution for Long COVID, this work is a promising step in the right direction. "&lt;em&gt;Our findings clearly demonstrate that Long COVID brain fog should be recognized as a legitimate clinical condition. This could encourage the healthcare industry to accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder&lt;/em&gt;," concludes Prof. Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the team's findings resolve key uncertainties about the biological basis of Long COVID brain fog and may pave the way for novel diagnostic tools and effective therapies for patients suffering from this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study from Scripps Research offers an important clue: a small midline brain region plays a key role in how animals learn to continue drinking to avoid the stress and misery of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science&lt;/em&gt; on August 5, 2025, the Scripps Research team zeroed in on a set of brain cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in rats. They found that this region becomes more active, driving strong relapse behavior, when rats learn to associate environmental stimuli with the easing of withdrawal symptoms by alcohol. By illuminating this brain pathway, the research sheds light on one of the most stubborn features of addiction -- drinking not for pleasure, but to escape pain -- and could eventually lead to new treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs) as well as other maladaptive behaviors including anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What makes addiction so hard to break is that people aren't simply chasing a high," says Friedbert Weiss, professor of neuroscience at Scripps Research and senior author of the study. "They're also trying to get rid of powerful negative states, like the stress and anxiety of withdrawal. This work shows us which brain systems are responsible for locking in that kind of learning, and why it can make relapse so persistent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This brain region just lit up in every rat that had gone through withdrawal-related learning," says co-senior author Hermina Nedelescu of Scripps Research. "It shows us which circuits are recruited when the brain links alcohol with relief from stress -- and that could be a game-changer in how we think about relapse."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From behavior to brain maps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 14.5 million people in the United States have alcohol use disorder, which encompasses a range of unhealthy drinking behaviors. Like other drug addictions, alcohol addiction is characterized by cycles of withdrawal, abstinence and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Weiss and Nedelescu used rats to study the types of learning that happen in the brain throughout this cycle. When rats initially begin drinking, they learn to associate pleasure with alcohol and seek more. However, that conditioning becomes far stronger during multiple cycles of withdrawal and relapse. After learning that alcohol eased the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal -- what scientists call negative reinforcement or a relief of 'negative hedonic state' -- the animals sought out more alcohol and would remain persistent even when uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When rats learn to associate environmental stimuli or contexts with the experience of relief, they end up with an incredibly powerful urge to seek alcohol in the presence of that stimuli -even if conditions are introduced that require great effort to engage in alcohol seeking," says Weiss. "That is, these rats seek alcohol even if that behavior is punished."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new work, the team wanted to pin down exactly what networks of cells in the brain were responsible for learning to associate environmental cues with the relief of this negative hedonic state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used advanced imaging tools to scan entire rat brains, cell by cell, and pinpoint areas that became more active in response to alcohol-related cues. They compared four groups of rats: those that had gone through withdrawal and learned that alcohol relieves a negative hedonic state, and three different control groups that had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several brain areas showed increased activity in the withdrawal-learned rats, one stood out: the PVT, which is known for its role in stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In retrospect, this makes a lot of sense," says Nedelescu. "The unpleasant effects of alcohol withdrawal are strongly associated with stress, and alcohol is providing relief from the agony of that stressful state."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that this negative hedonic state, and the activation of the PVT in the brain as a response, is critical for how the brain learns and perpetuates addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A better understanding of addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of the new study extend well beyond alcohol, the researchers say. Environmental stimuli conditioned to negative reinforcement -- the drive to act in order to escape pain or stress -- is a universal feature of the brain, and can drive human behavior beyond substance use disorders such as anxiety disorders, fear-conditioning and traumatic avoidance learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work has potential applications not only for alcohol addiction, but also other disorders where people get trapped in harmful cycles," says Nedelescu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will zoom in even further. Nedelescu and colleagues at Scripps Research want to expand the study to females and to study neurochemicals released in the PVT when subjects encounter environments associated with the experience of this relief from a negative hedonic state. If they can pinpoint molecules that are involved, it could open new avenues for drug development by targeting those molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the new study underscores a key shift in how basic scientists think about addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As psychologists, we've long known that addiction isn't just about chasing pleasure -- it's about escaping those negative hedonic states," says Weiss. "This study shows us where in the brain that learning takes root, which is a step forward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to Weiss and Nedelescu, authors of the study, "Recruitment of Neuronal Populations in the Paraventricular Thalamus of Alcohol Seeking Rats with Withdrawal-related Learning Experience," are Elias Meamari, Nami Rajaei, Alexus Grey, Ryan Bullard, and Nobuyoshi Suto of Scripps; and Nathan O'Connor of MBF Bioscience. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Osteoporosis is a major cause of fractures, disability and loss of independence in older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking weakens the bones by disrupting their natural remodeling process and slowing healing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The earlier you adopt bone-healthy habits, the stronger and more resilient your skeleton will be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying active and independent well into the future starts with strong bones. Your skeleton does more than give your body structure—it protects vital organs and makes every movement possible, from daily errands to new adventures. Bone health isn’t just a concern for older adults; it matters for everyone. The strength you build earlier in life directly affects how your bones age and your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-7-best-foods-for-osteoporosis-8706086" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of osteoporosis later on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile and more prone to fractures, which can severely limit independence. In fact, breaks caused by osteoporosis are among the leading causes of disability in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many daily habits can help safeguard your bones in the long term, but experts strongly urge one change in particular: quitting smoking. We spoke with orthopedists to explain why breaking this habit is one of the most effective ways to prevent osteoporosis, along with other expert tips for keeping your bones healthy and resilient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-quitting-smoking-is-so-important-for-bone-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Quitting Smoking Is So Important for Bone Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When asked about the top lifestyle change for bone health, experts have a clear answer. “The No. 1 habit I tell people to break is smoking,” says &lt;a href="https://www.resilienceorthopedics.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pamela Mehta, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; While most people know that smoking harms the heart and lungs, its devastating effects on the skeletal system are often overlooked. Research consistently links tobacco use to decreased bone density—the primary cause of osteoporosis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that smokers face a significantly higher risk of fractures compared to nonsmokers, and the longer you smoke, the greater your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The damage isn’t just a long-term concern; it directly affects your body’s ability to maintain a healthy skeleton. “I’ve seen otherwise healthy, active people develop brittle bones far earlier than expected simply because of long-term smoking,” says Mehta. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s a closer look at why smoking is so harmful for your bone health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Disrupts Bone-Building Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your bones are constantly undergoing a process called bone remodeling, in which old bone is broken down and replaced with new bone. This delicate balance is managed by two cells: osteoclasts, which break down bone, and osteoblasts, which build it up. Smoking disrupts this balance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes interfere with how your body builds and maintains bone, essentially speeding up bone loss,” Mehta explains. Essentially, smoking increases the activity of osteoclasts while slowing down osteoblasts, leading to a net loss of bone mass and weaker bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Impairs Blood Flow and Nutrient Delivery &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy bones rely on a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients, delivered through the bloodstream. Chemicals in cigarettes—especially nicotine—cause blood vessels to constrict, reducing blood flow throughout the body, including to your bones. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This diminished circulation means your skeleton may not receive enough vital building blocks, such as oxygen, calcium, phosphorus and other essential nutrients needed to stay strong. As a result, bone remodeling slows, leaving bones weaker and more porous.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Complicates Healing &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The negative effects of smoking aren’t limited to long-term bone loss—they also create immediate challenges when an injury occurs. “Tobacco use inhibits bone formation and bone turnover, which contributes to delayed bone healing when a fracture occurs,” according to &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/providers/lori-fitton" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lori Fitton, Ph.D., APRN, CNP, CCD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is one reason why quitting smoking is often required before certain medical procedures. “Many orthopedic surgeons require a patient to be tobacco-free before an elective orthopedic surgery will be scheduled because tobacco use delays healing and increases the probability of postoperative infections,” Fitton adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The message is clear and stark: “Tobacco use is bad for all bones, whether they are healing bones or growing bones,” warns Fitton.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Quitting smoking is one of the most impactful steps you can take for your skeleton, but other habits also play a role in building strong bones. Experts say these lifestyle adjustments can further reduce your risk of osteoporosis while supporting overall skeletal health:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Calcium and Vitamin D.&lt;/strong&gt; Calcium is the main mineral in your bones, and vitamin D helps your body absorb it. Include calcium-rich foods like dairy products, leafy greens and fortified foods, and vitamin D sources such as fatty fish, certain mushrooms and fortified milk. Some people may need supplements to meet their needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Protein. &lt;/strong&gt;Protein not only builds muscle but it also strengthens bones. Aim to eat high-quality protein at every meal and snack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in Weight-Bearing Exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; Gravity-resisting activities stress your bones, triggering them to grow stronger. Include resistance training (body-weight exercises, weight lifting) and impact exercise (jumping jacks, skipping, jogging, sports involving vertical jumps) at least two or three times per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit or Avoid Alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt; Excessive alcohol intake can reduce calcium and vitamin D absorption and disrupt hormones that protect bones. Limit alcohol consumption to one drink per day for women and two for men—or skip it entirely for stronger bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bone health matters at every age. While some factors—like genetics—are beyond your control, the habits you build today may directly influence your skeletal strength tomorrow. One of the most important changes you can make is quitting smoking. Smoking interferes with your body’s natural bone-building processes, limits nutrient delivery and slows healing, all of which increase your risk of osteoporosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To further protect your bones, focus on a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, stay active with regular weight-bearing exercise and limit alcohol intake. By taking proactive steps now, you’ll build a stronger foundation to support an active, independent and vibrant life for years to come.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christine Wu Nordahl, senior study author and principal investigator at the UC Davis MIND Institute, said: 'This is not about finding a single cause. It's about recognizing the whole child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Supporting gastrointestinal health is one important step toward improving overall quality of life for children with autism.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in 31 children in the US is diagnosed with autism, a stark increase from about one in 150 in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in August in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613251362349#sec-2"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 475 children also enrolled in the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project. Of those, 322 (68 percent) were diagnosed with autism, while the remainder were neurotypical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The children were evaluated at three points: baseline (two to four years old), two years later (four to six years old) and 'middle childhood' (nine to 12 years old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caregivers completed questionnaires about their children's potential gastrointestinal symptoms, including how often they had abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, bloating, constipation, pain during a bowel movement, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, blood in the stool or blood in the vomit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents and caregivers ranked the frequency of each symptom from one to five (ranging from 'never' to 'always'). Children with at least one current GI symptom (within the last three months) were labelled as having gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants formally diagnosed with a digestive condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, was the most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants with autism, 43 had reported food allergies, which may have contributed to their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those who are typically developing (TD) reporting digestive issues at different points in the study. Autistic children showed a greater likelihood throughout the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that 61 percent of neurotypical children never reported GIS compared to 34.5 percent of children with ASD, a 55 percent difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the initial baseline visit, 47 percent of autistic children reported GIS compared to 30 percent of typically developing participants, making children with autism 44 percent more likely to have gastrointestinal issues at this point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the second visit, 40 percent of autistic children had GIS compared to 15 percent of those in the neurotypical group,  a difference of 91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after the third visit, GIS was recorded in 30 percent of children with autism and seven percent of neurotypical children, more than a four-fold difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each individual gastrointestinal symptom was more common in children with autism than their neurotypical peers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Constipation was the most common symptom in the autistic group, with 32 percent of participants reporting it compared to 11 percent of typically developing children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the neurotypical group, the most common symptom was abdominal pain, seen in 12 percent of patients. Among those with autism, abdominal pain was seen in 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diarrhea was the second most common symptom in each group, accounting for 27 percent of children with autism and 11 percent of typically developing children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the predicted probability of children in the ASD and TD groups developing gastrointestinal issues as they age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that over time, children with autism were twice as likely as their neurotypical peers to develop gastrointestinal issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted autistic children with more gastrointestinal symptoms were more likely to have more profound autistic behaviors like repetitive behaviors, anxiety, depression, aggression, defiance, social problems and sleep issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not explain why gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in autistic children, but it could be because many of them only eat a select few 'safe' foods, which generally are fried, low in fiber and highly processed, increasing the risk of bloating, constipation and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autistic people also often have imbalances in their gut bacteria, which may increase the chances of digestive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Results support the need for future research to assess the presence of and persistence of GIS in children with autism throughout childhood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christine Wu Nordahl, senior study author and principal investigator at the UC Davis MIND Institute, said: 'This is not about finding a single cause. It's about recognizing the whole child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Supporting gastrointestinal health is one important step toward improving overall quality of life for children with autism.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in 31 children in the US is diagnosed with autism, a stark increase from about one in 150 in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in August in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613251362349#sec-2"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 475 children also enrolled in the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project. Of those, 322 (68 percent) were diagnosed with autism, while the remainder were neurotypical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The children were evaluated at three points: baseline (two to four years old), two years later (four to six years old) and 'middle childhood' (nine to 12 years old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caregivers completed questionnaires about their children's potential gastrointestinal symptoms, including how often they had abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, bloating, constipation, pain during a bowel movement, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, blood in the stool or blood in the vomit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents and caregivers ranked the frequency of each symptom from one to five (ranging from 'never' to 'always'). Children with at least one current GI symptom (within the last three months) were labelled as having gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants formally diagnosed with a digestive condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, was the most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants with autism, 43 had reported food allergies, which may have contributed to their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those who are typically developing (TD) reporting digestive issues at different points in the study.

They could save your life. For years I've seen how heart attacks can turn a family's world upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the saddest part is in many cases the body has already given signals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;1. Frequent nausea and dizziness &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the red flags she highlighted are frequent nausea and dizziness, which many people wrongly put down to heat, stress or exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you don't have a clear cause like pregnancy, medications, or an infection, it's time to see a doctor,' Dr Yang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frequent nausea and dizziness, which many people wrongly put down to heat, stress or exhaustion, are early warning signs for heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/blog/5-warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack-you-may-not-know"&gt;Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, unsteadiness, blurred vision, or sudden vomiting can all indicate circulation issues that may point to an impending attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;2. Extreme fatigue and constant headaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another common but overlooked sign is extreme fatigue and persistent headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yang warned this isn't the usual tiredness from work or parenting, but a strange exhaustion that lingers even after proper rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it's accompanied by headaches that worsen over time, she said, it could be an early indicator of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead lifestyle-ccox"&gt;3. Numbness on one side of the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Do you suddenly feel like your arm, leg, or half of your face is falling asleep? This could be reduced blood flow or even a sign your heart isn't pumping as it should,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reduced blood flow to the heart can cause signals to merge with nerve pathways for the arm, resulting in the sensation of numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to the Heart Foundation, unsteadiness, blurred vision, or sudden vomiting can all indicate circulation issues that may point to an impending attack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, numbness, especially if it affects one side of the body, is also a common symptom of a stroke, which also results from interrupted blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;4. Sudden change in vision &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, a sudden change in vision - double vision, blurriness or one eye suddenly failing to focus - may indicate a blocked blood vessel and should be treated as urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The feeling has been described as 'a curtain falling across one eye' and occurs because the blood flow disruptions form clots or plaque build up which affect the retina or the brain's visual centres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Heart Foundation stresses that someone in Australia is hospitalised with a heart attack every nine minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While chest pain and shortness of breath are widely known symptoms, many Australians - particularly women - experience subtler signs such as dizziness, nausea, jaw or back pain, or feeling sweaty and unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may even suffer a silent heart attack, with no obvious symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs can appear alone or together, and often last at least 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Reduced blood flow to the heart can cause signals to merge with nerve pathways for the arm, resulting in the sensation of numbness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may come on suddenly or build gradually, which is why experts say any unusual or unexplained symptom should be checked without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The good news is there are ways to reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Heart Foundation recommends quitting smoking, exercising regularly, following a heart-healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol, managing stress, and monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with diabetes, keeping blood sugar under control is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women should also be mindful of specific risk factors such as PCOS, pregnancy complications, early menopause, autoimmune diseases, and hormone treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professional advice is simple: listen to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible to experience several of these symptoms or just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If something feels off, don't ignore it. The earlier you act, the better your chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 04:15:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>现有药物结合起来对抗世界上最常见的肝病-SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/existing-drugs-combine-to-fight-worlds-most-common-liver-disease/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 03:41:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOOWZ0UEp4a3BpVHRjYV9UdDhGQUx4Y29UUXVKSjhfOGg5WUxJZDA4bU9reHZQZlYyMTBBU2hCdjJSbU1BNTNCUjNFVksxTnhfMUdLaHF2Rjl0NWg5Rlg4bVJCT2hsQjFpQXE0OVBFbDFwbmN4RTl6SkY1N1dsUHdEd2RUM1NZY0t2N2JzZGtBaFJibGVQ</guid></item><item><title>53种完全不健康的高估习惯-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/overrated-healthy-habits/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p data-block-id="db5f4c10-3c28-4a93-a21f-48f4271121f7" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most people want to be as healthy as they can be so they can reach old age.

It's not about being proud of being fat. It's about not being &lt;em&gt;ashamed&lt;/em&gt; of being fat. It's about not letting other people make you think you're a bad person because you're fat.&lt;br&gt;Not being ashamed of your body is the first step in having a healthy relationship with your body and food. People who are ashamed and can't stand having people look at them, who haven't built up a resistance to other people's judgement and stares, do not go out and exercise. They stay home and feel bad and eat poorly.&lt;br&gt;People who accept their body as is and then work to become healthier by getting more activity and a better diet, rather than trying to punish themselves for being fat the way society wants them to, those are the people who successfully become more fit and improve their quality of life.&lt;br&gt;Most of those influencers are just trying to normalize seeing fat people do physical things in public.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhcrtbo/" target="_blank"&gt; Azur0007 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/young-plus-size-latin-woman-outdoors-using-phone-c-RLMJRYU" target="_blank"&gt; setofotografias / Envato &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-71/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451123"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451123" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-68e3b558e6649__700.jpg" alt="Young woman in urban setting checking smartwatch showing 10,000 steps goal completed, emphasizing healthy habits." title="Young woman in urban setting checking smartwatch showing 10,000 steps goal completed, emphasizing healthy habits."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;The whole 10,000 steps thing&lt;br&gt;It can discourage people from sticking with their walking goals &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newer research shows that even 7-8000 is enough movement for serious positive health changes, and the benefits of doing 10,000 is not remarkably higher than 8000.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even doing 5000 a day can be hugely beneficial to cardio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the 10K came from the Fitbit marketing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bigfatpisces:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh this is one of my favorite random facts!

It's landfillcore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West-Season-2713:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have such a gripe with skincare in general. The only things you need to do are to use gentle soap and moisturiser and to wear sunscreen every day, drink enough water and eat a healthy diet. That’s it, unless you have a specific skin condition, in which case a dermatologist will advise on extra products and diet/lifestyle changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragons_and_things:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolutely. My mum is 61 and doesn't look over 40. People ask her her skin care routine, she washes her face with soap every day and wears very little make up. Part of it is genetic, part of it is just being gentle on your skin aka, doing nothing to it.&lt;br&gt;I'm 27 and people have started asking me the same question (I look a lot younger). My answer is always, no make up, wash my face with face soap once a day, a gentle moisturiser before bed, sleeping well, and drinking a lot of water. People are always miffed that they waste so much time and money on their skin care when the answer is just be gentle with yourself.&lt;br&gt;Breaks my heart that children have been manipulated into this skincare routine nonsense. 😭&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhf5rnm/" target="_blank"&gt; PentulantPantalones &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/11czrqc/routine_help_what_order_should_i_use_these/" target="_blank"&gt; reddit &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-30/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451178"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451178" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/curated-lifestyle-GnlxrW8v5gQ-unsplash-68e4e07a2d504__700.jpg" alt="53 Overrated Habits That Are Not That Healthy At All" title="53 Overrated Habits That Are Not That Healthy At All"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Making your bed every morning.

I told him the risks, he didn't care. I pulled him some milk straight from the teat from my favorite cow. I'd sanitized her udder myself.

I see so many recipes on Pinterest that are self proclaimed as sugar free and then contain 1/2 cup of Maple syrup... &lt;br&gt;I hate that people still try to insist that they feel better/healthier etc when you tell them that their agave, rice, maple or whatever syrup won't help them with the downsides of sugar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Dates in small doses dont trigger blood sugar spikes though, contain antioxidants, but even here we talk about 3-4 daily not a whole box). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Natural sugars have only a Very slight decrease in blood sugar spikes compared to refined sugar, but it's not worth mentioning tbh. &lt;br&gt;Also: I do believe that people who consume natural sugars make more health conscious choices in their diet in general which makes them feel better, but not the replaced sugar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MessyMaple:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok so hear me out. I think eating natural sugars is better, BECAUSE...I need less of it for better flavor. Straight up sugar has almost no taste, so to make a difference, you need quite a bit of it. But maple syrup and honey give a richer and more complex taste, so I just put a tiny bit!

Chances are if you're eating three a day, snacks, and are heavy, you're eating too many meals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a *very* convoluted topic, and this little blurb barely even scratches the surface. Like an ice cube to an iceberg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;userhwon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've eaten 3, 1, 6, 5, and 2, each over extended periods. The best are 2 and 5.&lt;br&gt;2 means you don't have to mess with it so often, and can have a bigger dinner, when you want that feeling. But don't expect to get health benefits from doing this.&lt;br&gt;5 is for when you're exercising and trying to get healthy. You eat 10-15% more calories than you need when you want to gain more muscle than fat, and between 10% and 900 calories less than you need when you want to lose more fat than muscle. The large number of meals spreads them out evenly and keeps your insulin system from driving calories into adipose tissue so hard; food comas are the worst thing for your plans. (The hard limit at -900 calories avoids starvation mode in which your body shifts to a higher muscle/fat loss ratio to spare fat because it thinks you're in a famine and less muscle lowers your metabolism and lets you live off the fat longer.)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhdmznk/" target="_blank"&gt; Mary_Ellen_Katz &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/asian-young-businesswoman-eating-noodles-while-wor-YXVCTMA" target="_blank"&gt; s_kawee / Envato &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-63/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451125"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451125" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/apple-cider-vinegar-v0-qbez3jlo4-68e388c40d572__700.jpg" alt="Bottle of Bragg organic raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar held by hand promoting healthy habits and daily wellness." title="Bottle of Bragg organic raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar held by hand promoting healthy habits and daily wellness."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Apple cider vinegar for everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InvestigatorGo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is actually scientific evidence for it in diabetes but I imagine it is in conjunction with dietary changes.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhdptwt/" target="_blank"&gt; butterballartemis &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/18zeefb/apple_cider_vinegar/" target="_blank"&gt; anionos / Reddit &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-22/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451129"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451129" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I’ll start: drinking a gallon of water a day — super hyped, not needed for everyone.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhcibiv/" target="_blank"&gt; DryDraw4673 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451141"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451141" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Very restrictive diets don’t work in the long run.

The use of hormones to stimulate excessive dairy production can cause mastitis in cows. That can also increase the amount of pus in the dairy milk, which may be where the human health perspective comes in.

It was recommended to consume six cups, as in a measuring cup. But because the word cup and glass was used interchangeably, and the standard size drinking glass was 16 oz, it was thought that we had to drink almost 3 liters of water per day. When in reality it was originally recommended that we drink closer to 1.5 L per day. And as long as the liquid you're consuming is not full of sugars or unnatural ingredients, that counts towards your daily liquid intake. So in conclusion you do not have to drink almost 3 L of water per day, you need to drink approximately 1.6 L of almost any freaking liquid you want.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhd2avk/" target="_blank"&gt; Reasonable_Zebra_174 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-58/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451179"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451179" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Ik I will be downvoted to hell but honestly imo BMI. I think weight may not be as personal as a wake up time or whether breakfast makes you sick or energized but I still very much so believe there are certain weights where some ppl will be at their maximum. And for people that are curvier there will always be that extra weight that clings to certain body parts just based on genetic instructions than some other ppl that will easily get that weight otherwise. I think it’s still good to be around those weights just not married to them. They’ve already said that healthy habits aren’t just bc you are skinny. Then ofc ppl who weigh more due to muscles ofc are their own example too. Either way I ignore BMI. Am I healthy (blood work, energy, etc) and do I like how I look.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhefsuv/" target="_blank"&gt; Safe_Resort_8992 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-76/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451111"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451111" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/woman-does-video-call-at-local-store-2025-02-19-00-06-24-utc-68e3a1de07778__700.jpg" alt="Smiling woman holding a bottle of healthy dressing in a kitchen with jars of ingredients, promoting healthy habits." title="Smiling woman holding a bottle of healthy dressing in a kitchen with jars of ingredients, promoting healthy habits."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Juicing, just eat the fruit and get the fiber??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective-Arm9099:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the note of juicing, can I mention a pet peeve?

Obviously not total BS, It is great for cardio, but out of all of my friends who regularly go running, most of them have suffered at least a semi-serious injury from it and one just can't do it any more from a shattered ankle that never healed properly. Swimming is far better imo, if that's an option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;captainporcupine3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dont disagree that swimming is the better option overall, but its also very expensive compared to running around your neighborhood, not to mention much more time consuming. I get my full jogging workout in 30 minutes flat including prep and cool down.

The topical collagen creams and most other anti wrinkle lotions are grifts as well.&lt;br&gt;When I was a teen, I watched a news segment where a dermatologist said most beauty creams were useless because nothing can penetrate beyond the outer layer of skin. The purpose of skin is to protect your body from outside irritants.&lt;br&gt;Anything that claims to do more than resurface the outer layer of your skin is just snake oil. That stuff &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; works but people will believe in and buy anything that promises to prevent death or slow aging. That’s why the beauty industry is so massively profitable.&lt;br&gt;Water, nutrition, and sun protection are the only things that can make any difference internally but I guess there’s not enough money in that.&lt;br&gt;How do they even synthesize collagen and turn it into powder anyway? Since supplements aren’t regulated, I always wonder if the people ingesting powdered collagen aren’t just drinking ground plastic or something lol.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhdrpsn/" target="_blank"&gt; DryDiet6051 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightTraining/comments/19885ke/vital_proteins/" target="_blank"&gt; reddit &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-77/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451192"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451192" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Chiropracty there is virtually no scholarly evidence for its benefits.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nw1932/whats_the_most_overrated_healthy_habit_that/nhdosax/" target="_blank"&gt; hemanstarfox &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10571-89/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9451225"&gt;  &lt;p id="9451225" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Exercise to the point of burnout.

This outbreak surpasses the country's total cases from the entire previous decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya spreads through mosquito bites and causes severe joint pain that can last for months. Although it is seldom deadly, it causes headaches, muscular aches, and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chinese authorities have responded with strict containment measures, including asking residents to drain any still water. Workers spray bug killer across affected zones several times a day. Meanwhile, hospitals built isolation beds with mosquito nets, and officials have demanded immediate reports of suspected infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, not all residents are on board with the Chinese government's disease control approach. One resident posted on social media: "It's really great to see years of accumulated old trash removed. But it's a bit too much to dump out even the cats' water bowls. That's a classic case of the one-size-fits-all approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control warned Americans in August about traveling to Guangdong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is the chikungunya outbreak concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher global temperatures create perfect environments for reproduction for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Regions that have avoided mosquitoes for decades are facing new health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus infected 270,000 people worldwide this year, killing an estimated 110. Now, nearly six billion people live where chikungunya could spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Infected travelers unknowingly transport the virus between continents: for instance, someone bitten in China boards a plane, lands elsewhere, gets bitten by a mosquito, and spreads the illness, starting another outbreak. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/causes-and-spread/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the virus rarely spreads between people without a mosquito as a vector; however, the risk of this happening is higher during the early stages of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can I do to help prevent chikungunya?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you live in a warm climate, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/waste-less-water/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:remove still water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;remove still water&lt;/a&gt; around your home where mosquitoes reproduce. Check gutters, planters, and outdoor containers every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Put up window screens and apply bug spray when you go outdoors.

Those with serious symptoms may isolate themselves to the point they rarely leave their home and are unable to work and build meaningful relationships. Standard medications may make little difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCSF neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jennifer.mitchell"&gt;Jennifer Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, develops novel therapeutics for drug and alcohol abuse, PTSD, stress, anxiety, impulsivity, and depression. She believes there’s a treatment that can do more. So far, this experimental drug has shown surprising results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this mystery treatment? It’s the pharmaceutical formulation of LSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;What is generalized anxiety disorder? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder is a form of chronic anxiety that seems disproportionate to the actual events promoting that anxiety. It interferes with life on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients may have difficulty concentrating, retaining information, and making decisions, so it can be challenging to find and maintain a job, and deal with managing a home and parenting. They may suffer from depression secondary to anxiety and feel restless, keyed up, and easily fatigued. They may be reluctant to leave home because they fear situations where they could feel trapped, helpless, or humiliated.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How is it different from day-to-day anxiety?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder is that it manifests as physical symptoms. Persistent worry activates the body’s fight-or-flight response, triggering stress hormones that cause physical effects. Patients may have muscle tension and rapid breathing, and report symptoms like headaches and insomnia, ringing in the ears, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How is generalized anxiety disorder treated? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s usually treated with medications like Zoloft and Paxil that boost and stabilize the neurotransmitter serotonin, leading to reduced anxiety and enhanced emotional well-being. These medications have been found to reduce symptoms by an average of 1.25 points on the 56-point anxiety scale — insufficient to make significant difference for at least some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;Why LSD?   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSD as well as other psychedelics, have tremendous potential to shift mood and emotions when used in a controlled, therapeutic setting. We have seen this in a previous trial of Ecstasy to treat PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical formulation of LSD is MM120. Its primary mechanism is to promote neuroplasticity in the brain, potentially altering negative thought patterns. It also increases communication between brain regions that may address the rigid thinking that underlies GAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How effective is MM120?   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier phase of the study, published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838505"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, the effects of a single dose of MM120 were evaluated over a 12-week period in approximately 200 participants with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder. The drug significantly alleviated symptoms, reducing them by five to six points on the anxiety scale in addition to the effects of placebo. That’s quite significant and enough to reclassify moderate generalized anxiety disorder as mild in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;Were there side effects? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were carefully monitored by medical staff during the period after the drug was administered. Side effects were generally mild or moderate and included hallucinations, visual distortions, nausea, and headache. It’s important to note, these were more prevalent using the highest dosage — which we will not be using since it was found to be no more effective. Nausea is a common side effect with psychedelics, but this was reduced by restricting participants to a light breakfast and treating them proactively with an anti-nausea medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;What challenges do you face recruiting participants for the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for people with moderate-to-severe general anxiety disorder, so typically those with disabling symptoms who are reluctant to leave their home. Ironically, people who would best qualify are least likely to show up. Participants are screened by very skilled clinicians who probe and observe body language and carefully build a rapport. We hope this builds trust and enables participants to be vulnerable and reflective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3 class="eyebrow-title"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn More about MM120 trials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in participating in MM120 trial sites at UCSF and other California locations, please check &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/trial/NCT06741228"&gt;this information&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details about more MM120 trial sites can be found &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06809595"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="caption caption-drupal-media"&gt;

"Some items you eat regularly seem normal, but they are actually loaded with sugar."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further highlights the top five sugar-heavy foods we often overlook:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Breakfast cereals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just one bowl can contain 3–4 tablespoons of sugar," Dr Krishna says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Flavoured yoghurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may seem healthy, but the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/reducing-sugar-content-of-sodas-leads-to-lower-sugar-consumption-research-101680418286537.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="sugar content"&gt;sugar content&lt;/a&gt; is so high it can equal a dessert," he warns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Ketchup and sausages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat them with fries or samosas, the added ketchup can make it impossible to track your sugar intake," Dr Krishna points out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Packaged fruit juices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if the label says 100% fruit juice, many contain added sugar," he cautions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Tea and coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We often add two to three teaspoons of sugar in the morning, which can significantly raise our sugar levels," he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Krishna advises, "Be aware and track your sugar intake carefully. Even everyday foods can contribute to excessive sugar consumption without you realising it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today said a case of mumps has been confirmed in an individual on Hawaii island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said this case is community-acquired, and not travel-related, suggesting that mumps may currently be circulating on the island. Officials are working with the individual’s family, health care providers and Hawaii County officials to identify close contacts and prevent further spread. Officials declined to specify whether the individual is an adult or child due to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, officials want the public to know the individual attended an event at Harold H. Higashihara Park in Kailua-Kona from 4:30 and 6 p.m. on Sept. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who attended this even should contact DOH for guidance, and monitor themselves for symptoms until Oct. 20, which is 25 days after exposure. Anyone who develops symptoms should isolate for five days after symptom onset, and avoid contact with others, especially infants, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with suspected mumps should also call ahead before visiting a clinic or hospital to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/mumps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mumps &lt;/a&gt;is a contagious viral illness that spreads through coughing, sneezing, talking, or sharing items such as cups or eating utensils.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms — which typically appear 12 to 25 days after exposure — include swollen, painful salivary glands, which result in puffy cheeks or a tender jaw; fever; headache; muscle aches; tiredness; and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said there is no specific treatment for mumps, and that care focuses on rest, fluids, and fever control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most people who fall ill with mumps recover fully, DOH said, it can cause serious illness in some, including inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, pancreatitis, encephalitis, meningitis, and loss of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While mumps is preventable with vaccination, even one case is concerning because of how easily the virus spreads,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble in the news release. “We encourage all Hawaii residents to check their vaccination records and ensure they and their families are fully protected with two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All children should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine by age 6, while adults born in or after 1957 should have documentation of vaccination or a blood test showing immunity. Certain adults at higher risk of exposure may need an additional MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii experienced a significant mumps outbreak from March 2017 through October 2018, with 1,009 confirmed cases statewide. Most cases were on Oahu, but also occurred on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii counties.&lt;/p&gt;

By the age of 30, adults typically lose between 3% and 8% of muscle mass, with the rate accelerating each decade. After 60, muscle loss can reach up to 15%. While this natural decline may feel inevitable, research shows that strength training can counteract it, improving health, mobility, and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, evidence suggests that “just like heart-pumping aerobic exercise, strength training also may help older adults live longer” (Harvard Health). Maintaining strong muscles supports posture, balance, and metabolic health, which collectively contribute to healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Simple Workouts for Effective Muscle Building | Enhance Strength and Endurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="22788980" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="squats" source="keywords"&gt;Squats&lt;/keyword&gt;: The body weight exercise experts recommend&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to lift heavy weights to enjoy these benefits. Body weight exercises can effectively maintain and build muscle mass, and among them, squats stand out. Squats engage multiple muscle groups, stimulate the cardiovascular system, and improve neuromotor and skeletal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also help prevent age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), strengthen bones, improve balance, reduce fall risk, and enhance insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Ramirez, director at Viding Castellana in Madrid, told Vogue: “If we start in childhood or youth, we get a more solid musculoskeletal formation and a strength base that will protect us all our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even starting squats later in life can offer significant benefits, helping maintain independence and functional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How squats support &lt;keyword id="21332343" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="healthy-aging" source="keywords"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doing squats alone doesn’t guarantee a longer lifespan, they contribute to living stronger, more mobile, and more independent lives. Maintaining muscle strength after 50 helps protect against age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. As Harvard Health notes, the combination of aerobic and resistance training- including simple body weight exercises- can be a powerful tool for healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal isn’t merely to extend lifespan but to enhance quality of life. Squats, along with other forms of strength training, equip the body to handle daily tasks, maintain independence, and reduce the risk of injuries or chronic diseases. In short, integrating squats into a regular fitness routine can help ensure that your later years are not only longer but healthier and more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 01:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>如果您没有乳糜泻，您是否应该无麸质？ - NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/should-you-be-gluten-free-celiac/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt;) — Gluten-free diets have surged in popularity in recent years, even among people who don’t have an intolerance to gluten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gluten is a protein found in grains, including wheat, barley, rye and triticale &lt;a href="https://celiac.org/gluten-free-living/what-is-gluten/" data-type="link" data-id="https://celiac.org/gluten-free-living/what-is-gluten/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;(a cross between wheat and rye)&lt;/a&gt;. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten at all and must follow a strict gluten-free diet throughout their lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While gluten-free diets are essential for people with celiac disease and can be beneficial for those with gluten sensitivity, research suggests they may not significantly improve overall health for people who can tolerate gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="00pol4mj" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="00pol4mj" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s celiac disease?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease is “an autoimmune response to gluten that causes the body to attack the small intestine, causing belly pain, nausea, bloating or diarrhea,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/celiac-disease/what-is-a-glutenfree-diet" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/celiac-disease/what-is-a-glutenfree-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently no treatments or cures, and the only effective management is a lifelong gluten-free diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a milder form of gluten intolerance that can cause similar symptoms but without the &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/blogs/beware-of-avoiding-gluten-if-you-dont-have-celiac-disease" data-type="link" data-id="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/blogs/beware-of-avoiding-gluten-if-you-dont-have-celiac-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intestinal damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite celiac disease affecting only about &lt;a href="https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1% of the population in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, recent surveys and health trends indicate that many people without celiac disease have tried gluten-free diets in pursuit of perceived health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the drawbacks?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/ditch-the-gluten-improve-your-health" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/ditch-the-gluten-improve-your-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;, “There is no compelling evidence that a gluten-free diet will improve health or prevent disease if you don’t have celiac disease and can eat gluten without trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Beyond the lack of proven benefits, Johns Hopkins Medical warns that cutting out gluten entirely could lead to less healthy eating habits overall. People may miss out on the benefits of nutritious whole grains, fiber and essential micronutrients. Whole grains can help lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar, key factors in maintaining heart health and preventing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, food containing gluten can be a good source of vitamins and minerals crucial to a well-balanced diet. Gluten-free alternatives can also be more expensive, processed and contain sodium, sugar and unhealthy fats. Thus, a gluten-free label doesn’t necessarily make food healthier.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why are people trying gluten-free diets?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite some health experts’ advice, social media trends, advertisements and celebrity endorsements have all contributed to a rise in the popularity of gluten-free diets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People without gluten sensitivities may be inspired to adopt a gluten-free diet in the hope of improving their overall digestive health or achieving weight loss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/celiac-disease/what-is-a-glutenfree-diet" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/celiac-disease/what-is-a-glutenfree-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that some of the health benefits associated with gluten-free diets can be achieved by paying closer attention to diet and reducing the consumption of processed foods and refined carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU), working with partners in the UK, has demonstrated a nanotechnology strategy that reverses Alzheimer's disease in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional nanomedicine, which relies on nanoparticles as carriers for therapeutic molecules, this approach employs nanoparticles that are bioactive in their own right: "supramolecular drugs." The work has been published in &lt;i&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting neurons directly, the therapy restores the proper function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the vascular gatekeeper that regulates the brain's environment. By repairing this critical interface, the researchers achieved a reversal of Alzheimer's pathology in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is the most expensive organ of the body, consuming 20% of the energy in adults and up to 60% in children. This energy arrives through a vast blood supply, assured by a unique and dense vascular system where each neuron is nourished by one capillary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain contains approximately one billion capillaries, highlighting the vital role of brain vasculature in maintaining health and combating disease. These findings highlight the crucial role of vascular health, especially in diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's, where a compromised vascular system is closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBB is a cellular and physiological barrier that separates the brain from the blood flow to protect it from external dangers such as pathogens or toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team demonstrated that targeting a specific mechanism enables undesirable "waste proteins" produced in the brain to pass through this barrier and be eliminated in the blood flow. In Alzheimer's disease, the main "waste" protein is amyloid-β (Aβ), whose accumulation impairs the normal functioning of the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used mouse models that are genetically programmed to produce larger amounts of Aβ protein and develop a significant cognitive decline mimicking Alzheimer's pathology. They administered only three doses of the supramolecular drugs and afterward regularly monitored the evolution of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Only one hour after the injection, we observed a reduction of 50–60% in Aβ amount inside the brain," explains Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University and Ph.D. student at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking data were the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/therapeutic+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;therapeutic effects&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers conducted various experiments to analyze the behavior of the animals and measure their memory decline over several months, covering all stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the experiments, they treated a 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to a 60-year-old human) with the nanoparticles and analyzed its behavior after six months. The result was impressive: the animal, aged 18 months (comparable to a 90-year-old human), had recovered the behavior of a healthy mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain's vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance," said Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC, Principal Investigator of the Molecular Bionics Group and leader of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Amyloid-β clearance from the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's disease, one of the key problems is that the brain's natural clearance system for toxic species like amyloid-β stops working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the protein LRP1 acts as a molecular gatekeeper: it recognizes Aβ, binds to it through ligands, and ferries it across the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood-brain+barrier/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; into the bloodstream, where it can be removed. But this system is fragile. If LRP1 binds too much Aβ too tightly, the transport clogs and the protein itself gets degraded inside the brain barrier cells, leaving fewer LRP1 "carriers" available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it binds too little, the signal is too weak to trigger transport. In both cases, the result is the same: Aβ builds up inside the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supramolecular drugs developed in this work act like a switch that resets the system. By mimicking the ligands of LRP1, they can bind to Aβ, cross the blood–brain barrier, and initiate the process of removing toxic species from the brain. In doing so, they help restore the vasculature's natural role as a waste-clearing pathway and bring it back to proper function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers introduce nanoparticles that act as supramolecular drugs, therapeutic agents in their own right rather than carriers of medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed with a bottom-up molecular engineering approach, these nanoparticles combine precise size control with a defined number of surface ligands, creating a multivalent platform able to interact with cellular receptors in a highly specific way. By engaging receptor trafficking at the cell membrane, they open up a unique and novel way to modulate receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This precision not only enables the effective clearance of amyloid-β from the brain but also restores balance to the vascular system that maintains healthy brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative therapeutic paradigm offers a promising pathway for developing effective clinical interventions, addressing vascular contributions to Alzheimer's disease, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood–brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer's pathology," concludes Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at the Molecular Bionics group from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona (UB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was a collaboration among the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalunya (IBEC), West China Hospital of Sichuan University, West China Xiamen Hospital of Sichuan University, University College London, the Xiamen Key Laboratory of Psychoradiology and Neuromodulation, University of Barcelona, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA).&lt;/p&gt;

The mixture was left to evaporate, allowing the organic solvent to completely dissipate and form a homogeneous polymer film at the bottom of the vial. PBS solution was added to rehydrate the polymer film and sonicated for 30 min. The solution was stirred continuously for 7 days at 4 °C via a magnetic stirrer at 1000 rpm. The morphology of the A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs was characterized via transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100Plus, Japan). The diameter distribution was assessed via dynamic light scattering (Malvern Zetasizer Pro, UK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec6"&gt;Animals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the West China Hospital Animal Care Committee (IACUC-approved project number: 20211475A). Considerable efforts were made to minimize the number of animals utilized in these studies and to alleviate any pain or discomfort experienced by the animals. In all the experiments, the animals were housed in a room where the temperature was regulated, with consistent alternating cycles of light and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec7"&gt;Immunohistochemistry (IHC)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) of mouse brain tissue were deparaffinized with xylene and subjected to gradient alcohol hydration (100%, 80%, 50%, 30%). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched via the addition of 3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (room temperature, 10 min) following antigen retrieval (Biosharp, 22315828). The tissues were blocked with 1% BSA (Aladdin, A104912) at room temperature for 30 min. Aβ-targeting primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C (Servicebio, GB13414-1, 1:200), followed by washing with PBS. The sections were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (ABclonal, AS014, 1:150) at ambient temperature for 30 min and subsequently washed with PBS. DAB substrate (Elabscience, E-IR-R101, 1:20) was applied for 5 min, followed by hematoxylin solution (Servicebio, G1004) for 1 min and hematoxylin differentiation solution (Servicebio, G1039) for 10−15 s. The sections were immediately rinsed in running tap water for 20 s, treated with hematoxylin bluing buffer (Servicebio, G1040) for 1 min, and washed with PBS. Finally, the slides were mounted with quick-drying neutral resin (ZSZSGBBIO, ZLI-9516).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec8"&gt;Aβ extraction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following euthanasia via an overdose of isoflurane anesthesia, cardiac perfusion was conducted with cold PBS. The entire brain tissue was subsequently harvested and weighed. The brain tissues were subjected to comprehensive homogenization (Servicebio, KZ-5F-3D) employing a TBS solution enriched with phosphatase inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2302054) and protease inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2306008) at 70 Hz and −20 °C. The supernatant was segregated after the brain tissue homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C via an ultrahigh-speed centrifuge (Beckman, Optima MAX-XP). The sediment were subsequently resuspended in 70% formic acid (Aopusheng (Tianjin) Chemical, 20210610) and centrifuged at 100,000 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C for 1 h, after which the resulting supernatant was collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;Vessel extraction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following euthanasia via isoflurane overdose anesthesia, cardiac perfusion was conducted with cold PBS, then brain tissues were excised and weighed. The tissues were processed via vascular parenchyma isolation buffer comprising 10 mM HEPES (Servicebio, CR2207064), 141 mM NaCl (Aladdin, 111549), 4 mM KCl (Aladdin, P112134), 2.8 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Aladdin, C290953), 1 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Aladdin, M433513), 1 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Aladdin, S433623), and 10 mM glucose (Servicebio, CR2112094). To 500 μL of brain tissue homogenate, 1 mL of 26% (w/w) dextran (Next Sage, 61212ES60) was added. Following thorough mixing and a resting period of 15 min at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged (15,800 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 15 min, 4 °C). The upper layer subsequently represented the parenchymal fraction, and the lower layer corresponded to the vascular fraction. The vascular fraction was washed with PBS 2 × 5 min for further detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parenchyma and blood vessels underwent comprehensive homogenization using a tissue lysis mixture (Yase, 016c1050) enriched with a phosphatase inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2302054) and a protease inhibitor (Servicebio, CR2306008) at 70 Hz and −20 °C. The tissues were allowed to fully lyse at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected via centrifugation at 14,000 × &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentrations of various proteins, including LRP1 (NOVUS, NBP3-00449), PACSIN2 (Anruike, YX-160103M), Rab5 (abbexa, abx154598), and Aβ (Invitrogen, KMB3441), were determined via ELISA kits following the manufacturer’s protocols. For Aβ in the blood, the test was performed directly according to the ELISA instructions. Aβ extracted by formic acid needs to be neutralized with Tris base before testing. Protein concentrations were calculated on the basis of the curve equation (four-parameter fit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Confocal imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confocal images were captured via a Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope equipped with Diode 405, Argon, DPSS 561, and HeNe633 lasers. Imaging was conducted at a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels and a scanning speed of ×100. Colocalization analysis to derive PCC (r) was performed via the colocalization plug-in for ImageJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;STED imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;STED nanoscopy experiments were performed under a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope equipped with a Leica TCS SP8 STED-ONE uni. The dyes (TSA570, TSA620 and TSA750) were excited under an STED laser. The emission signals were collected via HyD reflected light detectors. The depletion beam was applied at wavelengths of 592 nm, 660 nm, and 775 nm (50% power), with a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels and a scanning speed of ×100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) stain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse brain tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through gradient alcohol dehydration. Following antigen retrieval, 3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was utilized to inactivate endogenous peroxidase (Biosarp, 22315828) for 10 min. Permeabilization of the sections at room temperature for 10 min was achieved with 1% Triton X-100 (Biofroxx, 1139ML100). The sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the samples were incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 10 min. Subsequent to a PBS rinse, the TSA fluorescent solution (Absin, abs50031) was applied and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was subsequently conducted. The aforementioned steps were repeated with distinct primary antibodies, including antibodies against LRP1 (ABclonal, A1439, 1:100), Aβ (Servicebio, GB13414-1, 1:200), CD31 (Cell Signaling, 77699, 1:300), Rab5 (Thermo Fisher, PA5-88260, 1:200) and CD146 (Abcam, ab75769, 1:300). Various wavelengths of TSA, including the TSA520, TSA570, TSA620, and TSA700 dyes, until multimeric fluorescence staining was achieved. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Solarbio, C0065) for 5 min and then sealed with antiquenching sealing agent (Solarbio, S2100).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;APP/PS1 POs (12-month-old) mice were injected intravenously with the commercial Aβ radiocontrast agent [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] AV-45 (2.8–3.2 MBq). Then, intracranial images of the mice were acquired via a micro-PET-CT imager (Inviscan, France) according to operation specifications. After a recovery period, saline (200 μL) was intravenously injected into wild-type mice (3- and 12-month-old) and sham APP/PS1 mice (12 months old). The APP/PS1 POs were intravenously injected with 200 μL of A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs (10 g/L). After 12 h, all the mice were intravenously injected with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] AV-45 (2.8–3.2 MBq). Intracranial images of the mice were acquired via the same imager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Hematoxylin‒eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice tissue sections (5 μm) were dewaxed and rehydrated. The sections were stained with hematoxylin solution for 5 min, immediately rinsed in running tap water for 10–15 s, followed by incubation with hematoxylin differentiation solution (Servicebio, G1039) for 10–15 s. Subsequently, the sections were treated with hematoxylin bluing solution (Servicebio, G1040) for 30 s and washed in running tap water. The sections were then stained with eosin staining solution for 30 s, followed by washing with ethanol. The slides were dehydrated through a gradient of ethanol (100%, 80%, 50%, 30%) and xylene. Seal the sections with quick-drying neutral resin (ZSZSGBBIO, ZLI-9516).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Tissue clearing and staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paraformaldehyde-fixed mouse brain were treated with 1/2 CUBIC-L solution (80 mL Milli-Q, 5 g Triton X-100, and 5 g N-butyldiethanolamine (Aladdin, 102-79-4)) at 37 °C for 6 h. Then, the solution was replaced with a CUBIC-L solution and incubated at 37 °C for 15 days, with the new CUBIC-L solution being replaced every 2 days. The brain tissues were subsequently washed three times with staining buffer (1.5 M NaCl). The hyalinized brains were transferred to staining buffer containing a vasculature probe (Vector, DL-1178-1, 1:100) and an Aβ probe (Abcam, ab216983, 100 nM) for fluorescence staining (RT, 3 days). The refractive index was adjusted via a CUBIC-M solution (25 g Milli-Q, 45 g antipyrine (Aladdin, 60-80-0), 30 g N-methylnicotinamide (Aladdin, 114-33-0), and 125 μl of N-butyldiethanolamine)). Images were analyzed via Amira and iMaris software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donepezil HCl (Aladdin, D129948) was dissolved and added to a polymer film preparing donepezil HCl@A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs, followed by dialysis using a 3 kDa dialysis bag for 7 days. The concentration of donepezil HCl in the dialysis fluid was measured to calculate the encapsulation efficiency. Sodium 1-decanesulfonate (Aladdin, S100284) was dissolved in pure water (15.7416 mM/L) and filtered. Chromatographic grade acetonitrile solution and perchloric acid were added, followed by ultrasonication for 10 min. Standard solutions of donepezil HCl at concentrations of 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.625, and 7.8125 μg/mL were prepared. The content of donepezil HCl was detected via an Agilent-1260 chromatograph at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, a column temperature of 35 °C, a volume of 20 μl, and a detection signal at 271 nm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Morris water maze (MWM) experiment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each group, the mice were administered a caudal vein injection daily (A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs, donepezil@A&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;-POs, donepezil, or saline), which was continued for three days. The mice were subsequently housed in a standard rearing environment for seven days to acclimatize and recover. For the analysis, the pool was segmented into four quadrants. From days 11 to 14 (days 375–378 of lifespan), a platform was positioned in quadrant II, and the animals were introduced into the thermostatic pool from each quadrant daily, with time taken by the mice to locate the platform recorded as escape latency. If the mice failed to reach the platform within 120 s, they were guided to it and remained there for 30 s. A spatial probe (Stage II) was performed on day 15 (day 379 of lifespan). Once the platform was removed, the mice were placed in the water from the IV quadrant. The results of the spatial probe were expressed as either the percentage of time the mice remained at the original escape platform location or the number of times they passed. Reverse place navigation trials were conducted from days 16 to 19 (day 380–383 of lifespan), with the platform positioned in the IV quadrant which opposite the original platform location. The animals repeated the regimen from days 11 to 14, and the reverse escape latency was documented. On day 20 (day 384 of lifespan), the platform was removed, and the mice were introduced into the water from quadrant II. The results of the reverse spatial probe are expressed as either the percentage of time that the animal spent on the original platform position or the number of times it crossed the location. In addition, 6 months later, the mice were subjected to place navigation (stage V) and spatial probe (stage VI) experiments again with the same methods and conditions. Animal performance was recorded by the same tracking system (EthoVision XT, Noldus Information Technology) for each stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Sucrose preference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of Stage IV and Stage VI, the sucrose preference of the sham, APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 POs was tested. Each mouse was housed individually and allowed to acclimatize to the cage, which contained two bottles of standard pure water, for 2 days. One of the bottles was subsequently filled with 2% sucrose solution. The amount of water consumed by the mice was recorded, and the water in each bottle was refreshed daily. Sucrose preference = Sucrose water consumption/(Sucrose water consumption + Standard purified water consumption) × 100%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Nest construction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days after the sucrose preference experiment, each mouse was housed individually and then adapted to a single-cage environment for 7 days. Subsequently, 10 pieces of paper (5 × 5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were added to each cage and evenly placed. After 4 days, the nesting test results were scored in accordance with the improved 4-point scoring system.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Guo, J.-W. et al.

Total protein concentrations were determined via a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Biosharp, BL520A). The samples were diluted in 1× sample buffer and 5× master mix (ProteinSimple) to a final loading concentration of 1 μg/μL, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. They were then loaded into wells at a volume of 3 μL per well. Denatured samples, blocking buffer, primary antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jess modular antibodies, ProteinSimple), wash buffer, and chemiluminescent substrate (1:1 luminol-peroxidase mixture) were sequentially loaded into the designated detection plate wells. The primary antibodies used included rabbit anti-CD31 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, #77699), anti-CD146 (1:50; Abmart, T55209), anti-NeuN (1:50; Abcam, ab177487), and anti-β-actin (1:300; Servicebio) antibodies. Automated capillary electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and signal acquisition were performed via the Jess system according to operation specifications. The data were analyzed with Compass for Simple Western software (v6.2, ProteinSimple).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Proximity ligation assay (PLA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein‒protein interaction analysis was performed using the Duolink® PLA Kit (Sigma‒Aldrich; DUO96000 and DUO96040) strictly following the manufacturer’s operational protocol. The brain slices of the mice were pre-stained with TSA dye for pericytes (CD146, Abcam, ab75769), endothelial cells (CD31, Cell Signaling, 77699), and astrocytes (GFAP, Invitrogen, PA5-16291). After sodium azide neutralization pre-treatment, the antibodies, LRP1 (Abcam, ab92544), PACSIN2 (Invitrogen, PA5--99032), and Aβ (ABclonal, A24422), were conjugated to species-specific PLA probes (DUO96040). Subsequent procedures inclouding incubation, hybridization, ligation, amplification, and signal development—were conducted according to the kit’s standard protocol. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and images were acquired via confocal microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 23:30:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBTR24tcnZpdTdXM0RBaWQtRERUUlBJOUxVMkhQTlVGc3N1cGRWRVFlRkV4Sk8zVTNaNlpVSjFIemcxVXZHVktMRnFIVk9tRy1qYnA3N3RlMnBib1MtamxF</guid></item></channel></rss>
