Yet more benefits were seen around inflammation, a driver for cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our oral health is connected to our general health,” said Dr Sadia Niazi, a senior clinical lecturer in endodontology at King’s College London. “We should never look at our teeth or dental disease as a separate entity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Root canal treatment is one of the most common – and perhaps most feared – dental procedures, though much of the anxiety derives from &lt;a href="https://www.aae.org/patients/root-canal-treatment/myths-root-canals/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;myths and misconceptions&lt;/a&gt; that hark back to the days of poor anaesthetics. The treatment is performed to treat infection or damage to the tooth’s pulp, the soft inner tissue of a tooth that contains nerves, blood vessels and connective tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to a public health survey in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-oral-health-survey-2021/adult-oral-health-survey-2021-self-reported-health-of-teeth-and-gums" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than a third&lt;/a&gt; of adults in England had received a root canal treatment, rising to 50% in those aged 55 to 74. In the US, more than 15m root canal procedures are performed each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers followed 65 patients from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust in London for two years after root canal treatment. Before the procedure and at four points later, they analysed the patients’ blood molecules to see how they processed sugar, fat and other substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dentists know that long-standing tooth infections can lead to bacteria entering the bloodstream. Once circulating, the microbes can increase inflammation and impair the body’s ability to control blood sugar levels. It was unclear, however, whether root canal treatment had benefits beyond clearing up the tooth infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-07110-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Journal of Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers describe seeing meaningful changes after root canal treatment in more than half of the blood molecules they analysed. The results point to short-term improvements in fat metabolism and long-term improvements in blood sugar levels. Markers for inflammation, a driver for a multitude of chronic diseases, dropped after the dental procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not about treating the single tooth. This has long-term benefits on the general health of the patient, particularly the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes,” Niazi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People must understand that your mouth is the main gateway to your general health, so looking after your oral health and doing regular checkups with your dentist and getting disease treated early is the best course of action.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings are particularly important for global health, since chronic tooth infections often go untreated. According to the World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organization, 3.7 billion people globally live with untreated oral disease. Given the broader health impact of tooth infections, oral health should be integrated into a patient’s general healthcare, Niazi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The research was published a week after a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf555/8237946?login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; at University College London found treatment for severe gum disease could prevent arteries from becoming clogged, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. The treatment reduced inflammation caused by the gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Marco Orlandi, the trial’s co-principal investigator, said: “Oral conditions such as gum disease have been associated with a plethora of non-communicable disease such as cardiovascular, metabolic, rheumatic and neuro-degenerative conditions.” Gum disease should now be considered a “non-traditional risk factor” for clogged arteries, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 01:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQNl9IbDJrd0VlQTgtcFVnb0Q3SU8zTEpycm81MWY5OXFkQTJ1eUl2bV9uc0ZlOWpfNmFkS0REMGp1NmRFbFpudlh2SEx3Rnp2eTVOZ0hrZ0tOQkFJVFZkZWFwY3JSZTZFQmJkdlA3VGxCOVozTGhaM2UteXdBU3lxUy05b3ZCR0FwcXNBeFFIUnFRUkRnR1k1UlJXdUZXZ3luVHdkaldUenh1MTMwcUtuZjZZWjV3NG9xVTBjS183cFdtaG9XSXpR</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心首次将多个州的麻疹疫情联系起来-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/health/measles-us-elimination-status-outbreaks.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:25:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPbmJSZEVXUmttT0tkWWpCOEEyaGg4U3pzd1d6NEJnc2FacWlKOXlieUk4SDJ6YUxPbzhGS2xucW0xMy1SMElTTUhUQ0FDZ3ZkaVNyR0lrRW5kTEY5QVRoakxySEMtSHJEMmxfamRhUjJYSm5oYkNwVHNrcHd2SkRzWTZuX09fUTgwZTU3MXZHQQ</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿老年生活设施（ KOMO ）确诊阳性肺结核病例</title><link>https://komonews.com/news/local/positive-tuberculosis-case-confirmed-in-washington-senior-living-facility-tb-disease-infection-contagious-covid-flu-vaccine-investigation-health-healthcare-hospital-emergency</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;ISSAQUAH, Wash.  — &lt;/span&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County is actively addressing a confirmed case of active tuberculosis (TB) linked to the Aegis Living retirement community in Issaquah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department is collaborating with the facility to assess the extent of potential TB exposure and is aiding in the evaluation process for those who may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/red-carts-cut-fruit-and-al-pastor-king-county-warns-of-unpermitted-food-vendor-risks-hot-dogs-tacos-safety-salmonella-sick-cart-price-cheap-certification-risk-seattle-clean-water-refrigeration-fire-illness" target="_blank"&gt;Red carts, cut fruit, and al pastor: King County warns of unpermitted food vendor risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes providing guidance and information to both staff and residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health states that TB, an infectious disease caused by airborne bacteria, is notably harder to spread than illnesses like COVID-19, the common cold, or flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection typically requires prolonged exposure in confined indoor spaces. Even within households, only about one-third of close contacts become infected when exposed to a contagious individual, Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, Public Health recommended that 38 people associated with Aegis Living undergo TB evaluation. This process involves a medical risk assessment and a TB test, and the facility will directly contact those needing evaluation. All staff, patients, and their families are being informed of the situation this week, regardless of their exposure level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/tuberculosis-woman-tacoma-pierce-county-health-department-tpchd-17th-order-court-documents-antibiotic-resistance-bacteria-isolation-10-million-cases-washington-state-tb-treatment" target="_blank"&gt;Tacoma woman cured of tuberculosis after court-ordered isolation, treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any individuals are found to have latent TB infection, Public Health will facilitate treatment to eliminate the TB germs and prevent the development of active TB disease. Latent TB infection, which is not contagious, can be treated within three to four months. The individual with active TB is currently receiving treatment from Public Health, which typically involves a six to nine-month course of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active TB disease differs from latent TB infection in that it can be spread to others, while latent TB cannot. In King County, approximately 100,000 people have latent TB infection, with about 5% developing active TB within two years and another 5% over their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB primarily affects the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. In 2024, King County reported 110 new cases of TB disease, averaging about two diagnoses per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on TB signs, symptoms, and transmission, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublichealthinsider.com%2F%3Faction%3Duser_content_redirect%26uuid%3D1dbd8cba7b002bf2098f27689ff8fd30ca5072142b8bea2502593b0b48481366%26blog_id%3D70617574%26post_id%3D40730%26user_id%3D245971997%26subs_id%3D119072214%26signature%3D9eadabfc989a6cc6228bd0b1bdb5f84e%26email_name%3Dnew-post%26user_email%3Dtips%40komonews.com%26encoded_url%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi90Yi9kZWZhdWx0Lmh0bQ%3D%26email_id%3Db158b64bdecce417e996bd2a5443eedc&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Caberry%40katu.com%7C4ce0973950d84bb29b8108de26313fbc%7C897dbc0dc02d43479a713e589c67f8aa%7C0%7C0%7C638990190128594537%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=GbgllT5ZvFMtdnsVB1gDsHXdVqoiaHNfvwj%2B5oRn%2FoU%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;TB website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:52:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwJBVV95cUxNZUFDTWN1UE90RjRHd3hPbWxKeDEtU2NxSTJZVm5qdHRFYldtVDBlSzlrd3U2RkdzcmZncS00Y0FsVlgxRkZOZGhsU080SDZWSEI2cDNUVUpiWndFODloQXpJODZaalMzXzVFTHp1SGxKRzhtbHRpN0N0dGhpQ3RyMnNlcWRlRVJQQWFHRWNMM3JVZnFCNUZHbFNUUXlvbzBhMEhRMkZqVU5JeFp3R1p4LUZEUWNBbWtZTFVOeUlmVXdmWFlHS19selR1LXFGN2dwNVhZN3c4UXVVaHBvZnFTUGhTRU9XaTc0My1OcU5YaGx4aVJYeU9OaGRjQTB2TlRhOUdRQ0JfZzQ5ZUtnVGxtRlpTX1FVVEh0YzBzVmtwekJzNlB1LVBjbnRxVWRYdkU</guid></item><item><title>南佛罗里达州的爸爸在儿子从鬣蜥身上感染沙门氏菌后转向职业生涯；健康专家分享警告- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/south-florida-broward-county-iguanas-salmonella/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He was just really off, and started having gastrointestinal issues and just violently ill," said Stephen Dickenson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickenson said his son jumped in their backyard pool after the family was on vacation, before they realized the chlorine was off and there was iguana poop everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, his son got salmonella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk is there and it's real and it's not something that we grew up with, when we were younger, they weren't here so it wasn't something we were taught to think about," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Father pivots careers after iguana incident &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a connection the Dickenson's were familiar with before. But his son's sickness pushed Stephen to a career change.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became a professional iguana trapper, opening Method Iguana Services based in Pompano Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want our kids to go out and have fun in the environment that they're in, and we love all the old growth trees, but with the invasive iguanas coming in and then defecating onto the playground equipment, it's just hand to mouth," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it's easy to spot iguana poop in parks and playgrounds, often falling from trees above where they gather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What steps can you take to remain safe? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what should you do to keep your family safe? Dickenson suggests that you walk around the park first. If you see a lot of iguanas or droppings, skip that park and find another. You should also wash your child's hands with something antimicrobial after playing, especially before eating. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a major problem in South Florida with iguanas all over," said Dr. Otto Ramos. He's the director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Nicklaus Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramos said it's hard to prove 100% that iguanas cause the infection, but the connection is uncanny, with iguanas known to carry salmonella in their feces and saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warns they can be aggressive, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had children that have had to be admitted to the hospital and have had serious wounds," Ramos said. "When they bite, the teeth will be embedded in the skin, and it's very difficult to remove them, and they have salmonella in their mouth, so those wounds can get seriously infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some parks, you'll see wraps around trees to deter the lizards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts said avoiding the risk altogether is the safest bet, especially for pets, children, and the immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a client who is immunocompromised who was a transplant recipient, and his doctor said don't use your pool anymore because if you catch salmonella, that's it, and he said you're 30% more likely to catch salmonella to exposure to an iguana than raw chicken," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you have iguanas in your backyard, try to get rid of them," Ramos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dickenson, though it may sound daunting, it is doable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They get a sense of predation, so when they start getting removed, very quickly they move to neighbors who aren't doing anything about the problem, and so that's how a lot of my clients have been able to reclaim their backyards," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have identified a way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings in a similar fashion to drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the key to unlocking this natural process was found to be a gut microbe and its metabolites – the compounds it produces during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the abundance of this one gut microbe in diabetic mice, researchers led by a team at Jiangnan University in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; they can "orchestrate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mounjaros-effect-on-brains-cravings-measured-for-the-first-time"&gt;Mounjaro's Effect on Brain's 'Cravings' Measured For The First Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body and which helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness. GLP-1's release is stimulated by certain foods and gut microbes, and its mechanism of action is mimicked by drugs like semaglutide (the ingredient behind Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="181888" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; typically have impaired GLP-1 function, leading to issues with blood sugar control, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-protein-discovery-could-rival-ozempic-with-fewer-side-effects"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other GLP-1 agonists work as treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic natural processes in the body, and while they have proved very effective, some researchers want to figure out how to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A growing body of research has revealed that our cravings for dietary components originate from signals sent from the gut, a key organ in transmitting dietary preferences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors in their paper published in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, which genes, gut flora, and metabolites in the gut microenvironment are involved in the regulation of sugar preference is currently unclear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests gut microbes like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaeicola_vulgatus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their metabolites may help shape a person's sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments, if mice could not produce a gut protein, called Ffar4, the researchers found the gut colonies of &lt;em&gt;B. vulgatus&lt;/em&gt; shrank. This, in turn, led to a decrease in the release of a hormone known as FGF21, which is associated with sugar cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png" alt="New Study Hints at Natural Alternative to Ozempic Hiding in The Gut" class="wp-image-149407 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-729x415.png 729w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-768x437.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-1536x875.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-2048x1167.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-600x342.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of GLP-1 agonist pathway and FGF21 pathway.

                &lt;p&gt;The federal government is officially back to work, and unfortunately, so is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s influence over the country’s public health. Early next month, a panel of outside advisors assembled by Kennedy will meet once again and probably take a sledgehammer to more vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently posted the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; for the next meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for December 4 and 5. Among other things, ACIP plans to discuss the childhood vaccination schedule as well as “contaminants” in vaccines. Though it’s not exactly clear what ACIP will vote on during this meeting, some of its members will likely try to remove the decades-old recommendation that children be vaccinated against hepatitis B starting at birth—a decision that even some GOP lawmakers are trying to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I want to make America healthy, and you don’t start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier,” Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cassidy-louisiana-senator-face-the-nation-transcript-11-16-2025/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS News’ &lt;em&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/em&gt; in an interview released Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The hijacked ACIP&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Kennedy unilaterally dismissed all 17 members of the ACIP, the panel of outside experts that helps guide the CDC’s vaccine policies. He then quickly added new &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732"&gt;advisors&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom—like Kennedy himself—have a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In its two meetings to date, the rejiggered ACIP has issued several recommendations welcomed by the anti-vaccination movement. It moved to ban &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;the few remaining vaccines&lt;/a&gt; that contained thimerosal, for instance, an ingredient that antivaxxers have long accused of causing autism with dubious evidence. Though thimerosal was removed from most vaccines as a precaution in the early 2000s, studies since have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/#:~:text=Twenty%20epidemiologic%20studies%20have%20shown,of%20epidemiologic%20and%20statistical%20methods."&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to find any link to autism, and autism rates have only continued to rise. The ACIP also called for children under four to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-handpicked-vaccine-panel-nixes-measles-chickenpox-combo-for-kids-under-4-2000660333"&gt;no longer receive&lt;/a&gt; the combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV), a decision that the previous CDC had left up to parents.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These decisions, and the ACIP’s general shift away from science-backed evaluation, have helped fuel the internal collapse of the CDC. In late August, RFK Jr. fired former CDC director Susan Monarez just four weeks into her role, reportedly because she refused to sign off on the ACIP’s recommendations without conducting her own review; soon after, much of the CDC’s senior leadership resigned in protest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the ACIP’s worst decisions have been limited in their scope. Few vaccines today include thimerosal, and most families weren’t vaccinating their very young children with the MMRV shot. But the potential removal of universal at-birth hepatitis B vaccination threatens to be its most sweeping and damaging change yet.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Unscientific fears&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. In adults, it’s usually transmitted via sex or by sharing contaminated needles. But the virus can also be passed from an infected mother to the child during childbirth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though a hepatitis B infection can be managed with antivirals if it becomes chronic, there is no curative treatment currently. Most children with hepatitis B will have it for the rest of their lives, and about a quarter will experience serious health problems, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, ACIP and the CDC began to recommend that everyone receive the hepatitis B vaccine when young, eventually moving towards at-birth dosing for the first shot. This strategy was only adopted after previous attempts to just vaccinate the highest-risk groups failed to significantly lower cases. And since its implementation, rates of hepatitis B, especially in children, have steadily fallen in the U.S. The vaccine is also safe, with its most serious side effects, like anaphylaxis, being exceptionally rare and manageable with proper monitoring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting in September, CDC staff argued in support of at-birth vaccination and warned that more children would almost certainly develop hepatitis B if the policy was removed. Both sessions of the ACIP ran long, and at the very last minute—amidst &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03054-z"&gt;lots of confusion&lt;/a&gt; about what the members were actually voting on—the ACIP &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/universal-hepatitis-b-vaccination-at-birth-is-safe-for-now-2000661346"&gt;unexpectedly chose&lt;/a&gt; to table its planned vote on hepatitis B. Given the inclusion of hepatitis B on Friday’s agenda, however, it appears that reprieve was short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The inclusion of the childhood vaccine schedule on Thursday’s agenda is also plenty concerning. Antivaxxers have made no secret about their desire to tear the schedule to shreds if they could. The Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccination group founded by RFK Jr., hosted its “Moment of Truth” conference earlier this month. During the conference, Mark Gorton, president of the MAHA Institute—a group &lt;a href="https://civileats.com/2025/05/16/maha-supporters-form-new-organization-to-boost-rfks-goals-in-d-c/"&gt;founded&lt;/a&gt; to bolster Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy” movement—&lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1989725078050017351"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for the “childhood vaccination schedule to be eliminated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As before, the reformed ACIP has not revealed the contents of its votes scheduled for this next meeting. So it’s still up in the air just how far its members will go in trying to change the schedule. But there’s certainly no reason to be optimistic about what lies ahead for the country’s public health under the reign of RFK Jr.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at Indiana University have announced that they developed a molecular test that can simultaneously detect three major disease-causing fungi much faster than traditional methods, speeding treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1103652"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was presented at the recent Association for Molecular Pathology 2025 Annual Meeting and Expo in Boston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coccidioidomycosis, which are often linked to contaminated soil, occur in different parts of the United States. Because they are often mistaken for other respiratory illnesses, correct diagnosis of the potentially life-threatening infections remains low, which delays treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test directly targets genetic regions unique to each fungus, bypassing the slow culture process that is complicated by the fungi’s ability to switch between environmental and human forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compared with standard methods, the PCR test identified all samples with 100% accuracy. In addition, it was 100% specific, meaning that it didn't mistakenly flag other fungi or contaminants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our assay has the potential to significantly improve turnaround time and diagnostic confidence for infections that have historically been difficult to detect quickly," Kenneth Gavina, PhD, who oversaw the project, said in the AMP news release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could fill 'major gap' in fungal diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasmosis, which is most common in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys, usually presents as a lung infection in patients who have inhaled soil containing bird or bat droppings. Blastomycosis, which occurs mainly in the central and southeastern United States, also presents as a lung infection but can spread to bones, skin, and other organs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clinicians currently have no FDA [US Food and Drug Administration]–approved molecular tests for these three pathogens, making rapid, reliable detection a pressing need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coccidioidomycosis, or valley fever, typically causes mild infection but can lead to severe pneumonia or infection elsewhere in the body. It is seen primarily in southwestern states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"While additional clinical validation is under way, this assay shows strong potential to fill a major gap in fungal diagnostics," Gavina said. "Clinicians currently have no FDA [US Food and Drug Administration]–approved molecular tests for these three pathogens, making rapid, reliable detection a pressing need."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In serious cases, patients develop haemorrhaging from the nose, gums and internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopian authorities first detected the virus on Wednesday in the Jinka area after receiving alerts about a suspected hemorrhagic illness. Officials tested 17 individuals, identifying at least nine infections before confirming the initial deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daba said that work is progressing to bring the outbreak under control quickly through a coordinated national response. The government has activated emergency response centres at multiple levels and deployed rapid response teams to affected areas, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian minister added that no active symptomatic cases are currently being treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia has established its own laboratory testing capacity for Marburg at the national public health institute, allowing authorities to conduct diagnostics independently rather than relying solely on external support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister urged anyone experiencing symptoms to seek immediate medical testing at health facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International health teams from the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have arrived to support containment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry has also launched a public awareness &lt;a href="https://x.com/FMoHealth/status/1990334086637068734" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;, distributing infographics in Amharic detailing symptoms and prevention measures, and establishing a hotline for reporting suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marburg spreads through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus kills roughly half of those infected on average, though mortality rates have climbed as high as 88 percent in previous outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to WHO data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN health agency warns that health workers are especially vulnerable to being infected by the virus “through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practised”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian outbreak extends a troubling pattern of haemorrhagic fever emergencies across East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Marburg outbreak in Tanzania claimed 10 lives between January and March this year, while Rwanda ended its first recorded Marburg outbreak last December, with 15 people killed by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rwanda tested an experimental vaccine during its outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya expressed particular concern about potential spillover into South Sudan, citing the country’s weak healthcare infrastructure as a major vulnerability in containing cross-border transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 18:07:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>从不可战胜到不可阻挡：新的癌症治疗靶点出现-加州大学旧金山分校</title><link>https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/11/431086/undruggable-unstoppable-new-cancer-cure-target-emerges</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_narrow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly a quarter of all cancerous tumors are caused by mutations in the KRAS gene, which fosters cell growth. For more than three decades, scientists believed these mutations were impervious to treatment. Today, National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded discoveries by UC San Francisco Professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kevan.shokat"&gt;Kevan Shokat, PhD&lt;/a&gt; have produced the world’s first drugs that target KRAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="eyebrow-title"&gt;What they found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KRAS gene is present in nearly all of our cells and provides the blueprint for a protein called K-Ras that helps signal to cells to divide and grow. Some mutations in the KRAS gene cause this signal to get stuck in the "on" position and cells divide uncontrollably, while additional mutations occur to create cancerous tumors. Some of the deadliest cancers are the result, including lung, pancreatic, and colorectal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Shokat and his team became the first to discover a tiny “pocket” on the mutated K-Ras’ surface that would finally prove to be the protein’s Achilles’ heel. Shokat’s lab developed drugs that could snuggle into the pocket and bind to the protein, weakening and killing the cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="eyebrow-title"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shokat and his team at UCSF proved the K-Ras protein was “druggable” and could be targeted with medicine. Their discovery and subsequent drug development led the Food and Drug Administration to recently approve the world’s first two KRAS-targeting cancer treatments, sotorasib and adagrasib. Similar treatments are now in late-stage clinical trials, ushering in a new era in cancer treatment. The work has also inspired Shokat and others to explore new ways to target enzymes whose dysfunction can lead to Parkinson’s and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;dom-twocolumn-layout class="ck-widget" data-column1-size="50" data-column2-size="50" data-column1-color="transparent" data-column2-color="transparent" contenteditable="false" data-layout="50-50"&gt;&lt;div class="column2" slot="column2"&gt;&lt;h3 class="small-title"&gt;Saving Lives with Science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="null"&gt;UCSF scientists discover treatments for the most heartbreaking and costly diseases, pioneer new industries, create jobs, and safeguard America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="button" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/saving-lives-with-science" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8bdddc7e-6f57-4629-9db4-60a37e86a6f5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Saving Lives with Science"&gt;See how our research saves lives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/dom-twocolumn-layout&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study looked into how the cells responsible for the pigments in our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/tags/hair"&gt;hair&lt;/a&gt; and skin ‘self-destruct’ when damaged, as part of our body’s efforts to protect us from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/tags/cancer"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that, under specific types of damage, these pigment-producing cells simply shut themselves down instead of continuing to divide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That choice prevents faulty cells from spreading dangerous mutations – but over time, it also means fewer pigment-making cells remain, causing hair to turn grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long explored ways to stop pigment cells from self-destructing in an attempt to prevent greying, but the new findings suggest your greys are a sign of an important anti-cancer defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/11/Purple-GettyImages-1486775339.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="a Double helix broken in half" class="wp-image-209403"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Damaged DNA can develop mutations, which lead to cancer - Credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[This study] reframes hair greying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses,” said Prof Emi Nishimura from the University of Tokyo, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo team made the discovery while studying melanocyte stem cells in mice – the cells that normally produce hair pigment. They found these melanocyte cells only sacrificed themselves when their DNA experienced a ‘double-strand break’, essentially a clean snap through both sides of the DNA helix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the cells were exposed to other kinds of stress, such as ultraviolet light or carcinogens, they didn’t self-destruct. Instead, they survived and kept dividing, allowing mutations to build up and potentially laying the groundwork for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This two-track response – cells sacrificing themselves in some scenarios but clinging on in others – could help reveal why grey hair and skin cancers both become more frequent with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that understanding – and eventually controlling – this response could open the door to new ways of eliminating high-risk cells before they become cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers measured the changing electrical signals in the brain of a person with severe obesity who had experienced persistent ‘food noise’ — intrusive, compulsive thoughts about eating — shortly after the individual began taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to use electrodes to directly measure how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;blockbuster obesity drugs that mimic the hormone GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; affect brain activity in people, and to hint at how they curb extreme food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a great strategy to try and find a neural signature of food noise, and then try to understand how drugs can manipulate it,” says Amber Alhadeff, a neuroscientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The team’s goal was to test whether a type of deep brain stimulation — a therapy that involves delivering a weak electrical current directly into the brain — can help to reduce compulsive eating in people with obesity for whom treatments such as bariatric surgery haven’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01770-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03766-2/d41586-025-03766-2_51124480.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to keep weight off after obesity drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists set up a study in which participants had an electrode implanted into their nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that is involved in feelings of reward. It also expresses the GLP-1 receptor, notes Christian Hölscher, a neuroscientist at the Henan Academy of Innovations in Medical Science in Zhengzhou, China, “so we know that GLP-1 plays a role in modulating reward here”. This type of electrode, which can both record electrical activity and deliver an electrical current when needed, is already used in people to treat some forms of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study’s first two participants, the researchers found that episodes of intense food noise were accompanied by a surge in low-frequency brain activity. This pattern suggested that these changes could serve as a measurable sign of compulsive food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third trial participant, a 60-year-old woman, had just started taking a high dose of tirzepatide — which had been prescribed by her physician to treat type 2 diabetes — when she had the electrode implanted. “We took advantage of this serendipitous opportunity because of the excitement around these drugs,” Halpern says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food noise silenced&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Bird flu hasn’t gone anywhere, and it’s still sickening Americans. Health officials in Washington have confirmed that a resident contracted a nasty bout of H5N5 avian influenza—the first known case of its kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Washington State Department of Health &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-tests-preliminarily-positive-avian-influenza"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the case late last week. The victim is an older adult who was likely exposed to the virus through contact with their backyard chickens or wild birds. Though the variant may not have spread beyond this case, the resident remains hospitalized, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Public health disease experts have not identified any increased risk to the public,” the health department said in its latest statement &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/h5n5-avian-influenza-confirmed-grays-harbor-county-resident"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;First of its kind&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials initially reported the case last Thursday, which involved a resident living in Grays Harbor County. The next day, they confirmed the variant as H5N5. Though H5N5 has been found in birds and other animals before, this is the first known report of human illness from the variant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The person developed a high fever, confusion, and respiratory distress and was hospitalized sometime in early November. Aside from their older age, the person’s history of underlying health conditions may have contributed to the infection’s severity. The person owns a mixed backyard flock of domestic chickens that had previously come into contact with wild birds, which likely served as the source of exposure. But health and wildlife officials are still working to unravel the exact chain of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The ongoing danger of bird flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While this might be the first time H5N5 has jumped into humans, bird flu in general has become a more pressing threat in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early 2024, health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bird-flu-h5n1-found-in-cow-milk-texas-and-kansas-1851366354"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the discovery of H5N1 cases in cows on several dairy farms in Texas and Kansas. Since then, H5N1 has repeatedly infected dairy cows, other mammals, and sometimes people. There have been at least 71 human cases of H5N1 in the U.S., along with one death. Just this past September, USDA officials &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-dairy-herd-nebraska"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; yet another outbreak of H5N1 at a dairy farm in Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the risks posed by H5N1 or other bird flu strains like H5N5 are low to the general public for now, these outbreaks are still highly concerning. The longer these flu viruses are able to circulate in mammals like dairy cows, the greater the odds that a strain will evolve to efficiently spread between humans. If such a strain could transmit easily from human to human while causing serious illness, that would set the stage for the next big pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This latest human case of H5N5 may just be a dead end. But eventually, we might not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But the expansive aisles can feel daunting to wade through, so we asked &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/franceslrothrd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutrition author, her top snack pick for better blood sugar management. Her answer: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-pistachios-good-for-you-11821152" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pistachios;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pistachios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Pistachios Are The Best Snack for Lower Blood Sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Largeman-Roth loves Wonderful Pistachios, which come in 24-packs and feature eight single-serving 0.75-ounce packs of three different flavors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason these are Largeman-Roth's top pick is that the snack-size packets make portion control easy. "You can enjoy an entire package of these pistachios," says Largeman-Roth. "One bag of Wonderful pistachios provides 5 grams of plant protein, 10 grams of heart-healthy fat and less than 1 gram of added sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may seem like an exaggeration that one specific snack can lower blood sugar, it's actually possible, says Largeman-Roth, pointing out that pistachios are a nut that falls very low on the glycemic index, plus they're rich in antioxidants and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research backs this pick up, too. For instance, a meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found that eating about 2 ounces of pistachio nuts daily for at least three months was associated with lower fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin function in people with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes and metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study found that compared to the control group, participants who ate 1 ounce of pistachios before breakfast and 1 ounce before dinner for 12 weeks showed significant improvements in HbA1c (average blood sugar over 3 months) and cardiometabolic measures, like triglycerides and abdominal fat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Ways to Enjoy Pistachios&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, pistachios are amazing straight from the pouch, but if you're looking for other tasty ways to enjoy them, they make a great coating for fish and chicken such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8012968/air-fryer-pistachio-crusted-sea-bass/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Air-Fryer Pistachio-Crusted Sea Bass;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Air-Fryer Pistachio-Crusted Sea Bass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/256494/pistachio-crusted-chicken-with-warm-barley-salad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pistachio-Crusted Chicken with Warm Barley Salad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pistachio-Crusted Chicken with Warm Barley Salad&lt;/a&gt;.

That means that snacks should contain a combination of protein, healthy fat and carbohydrates, says Largeman-Roth. "This trio helps to stabilize blood sugar, which is beneficial not just for people with diabetes or pre-diabetes, but for all of us," explains Largeman-Roth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Largeman-Roth, the best blood-sugar-friendly snacks have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low or no added sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; "Some people think you can't have any added sugar without your blood glucose spiking, but if the snack has the requisite amount of fiber and protein, up to 5 grams of added sugar shouldn't set you off course," says Largeman-Roth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least 2 to 3 grams of fiber per serving:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health benefits of fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;health benefits of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, such as improved gut health and lower risk for certain cancers, fiber helps increase satiety, can aid in blood sugar control and, when consumed at adequate levels over time, reduces the risk for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least 5 grams of protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Protein takes a while to digest and doesn't cause spikes in blood sugar unless it's paired with high amounts of added sugar, according to Largeman-Roth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About 5 to 10 grams of fat:&lt;/strong&gt; Fat slows down the digestive process, causing a slower and steadier rise in blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Largeman-Roth awards bonus points if snacks can be enjoyed on the go, so they're readily available. "If you can't take it with you when you're feeling low in energy, it's not really a great snack for balancing blood sugar," says Largeman-Roth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you're at Costco, toss a package of the single-serving Wonderful Pistachios into your cart. Pistachios are an ideal vehicle for a balanced energy boost that also delivers important nutrients like potassium and vitamin B6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not everyone feels the need to snack in order to feel energetic during the day, but many of us do," says Largeman-Roth. "Having a balanced snack between meals can help keep blood sugar steady and also provide vital nutrients to help make your overall diet well-rounded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequently asked Questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is blood sugar only important for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to have diabetes to focus on maintaining balanced blood sugar levels. Eating snacks that help stabilize blood sugar is relevant for everyone to provide a steady supply of energy throughout the day, without dips and peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do not like pistachios. What other nuts are good for blood sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:All nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;All nuts&lt;/a&gt; may provide benefits for keeping blood sugar steady, as they all contain a mix of carbs, protein and healthy fats. Try to choose nuts with little or no added sugar, as this may defeat the purpose of them helping to stabilize blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I incorporate pistachios into my day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pistachios can be eaten as is or used in recipes to coat fish and chicken or in energy bites.

The hormone is something we’re all probably aware of but not entirely sure about. Aside from being responsible for facial hair and general &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt; during puberty, we know testosterone helps us lift weights and pack on muscle. And isn’t there &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5817427/" target="_blank"&gt;something about bald men having an abundance&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the knowledge can get a little shaky. But it certainly seems like men want to learn, judging by the hundreds of millions of TikTok searches for phrases like “&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/increasing-testosterone" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/increasing-testosterone"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/increasing-testosterone" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;increasing testosterone&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/supplements-for-testosterone" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/supplements-for-testosterone"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/supplements-for-testosterone" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;supplements for testosterone&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there’s a whole legion of men out there looking to boost testosterone levels, either through natural methods or supplements. But what does the science say? What does testosterone actually do for us? Which supplements and perscriptions can help? And is there a danger in overdoing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why testosterone is so important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone plays a crucial role in building muscle,” explains Ali Malik, founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.fitlabskensington.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.fitlabskensington.com/"}' href="https://www.fitlabskensington.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fit Labs Kensington&lt;/a&gt;. “When men have low testosterone levels, muscles can become weak. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27543675/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that increasing testosterone helps build a leaner body mass and helps fight age-related muscle deterioration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a pretty well-known effect of testosterone, but there's much more to the hormone than upping your jacked levels. Low testosterone—or male hypogonadism—is linked to depleted energy, low sex drive and decreased mood. With around 40 per cent of men over 45 affected, it's a problem to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything else it does for our bodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone plays a key role beyond sexual function and growth, including boosting brain function, improving cardiac health, and protecting your prostate and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone contributes to cognitive function, enhancing concentration, focus and mental clarity,” says Dr. Kerry Aston, founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.themovementmedic.org/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.themovementmedic.org/"}' href="https://www.themovementmedic.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Movement Medic&lt;/a&gt;. “It also influences factors such as vascular reactivity and lipid profiles, and helps reduce abdominal fat, which in turn reduces your risk of metabolic disease and poor cardiovascular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s a super hormone, one that keeps you big, strong and virile—and may well extend your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main benefits of boosting testosterone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a data-offer-url="https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/persons/amy-vivien-wells" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/persons/amy-vivien-wells"}' href="https://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/en/persons/amy-vivien-wells" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Amy Wells&lt;/a&gt;, senior lecturer in exercise physiology at the U.K.'s University of Hertfordshire explains, most of the studies into boosting testosterone look at deficient men and find that boosting testosterone might lead to improvement—things like “libido and sexual function, bone density, muscle mass, body composition and mood,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:06:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE1Qc2Fmdkl4ZnBSdnJvc2NfWG5RaUw0N1R0bGtoTmNKSmZvWEMyQ2dFZU8xWnRhMXNQQnpOaU5CNk9wRC1kdGRRMHJ4VmFvOWUzY1psV0lxc3MySVNtSktSbWpR</guid></item><item><title>是的，肌酸可以抵消压力和失眠- GQ</title><link>https://www.gq.com/story/creatine-counteracts-stress-and-lost-sleep-1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put another way, the science shows us that creatine’s ability to benefit your brain is at its best when you’re, well, not at yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brain levels appear tightly regulated and may rise only modestly with supplementation, unless the brain is energy-stressed or baseline creatine is low,” i.e., if you’re sleep-deprived, stressed out, or not getting enough creatine through your diet, says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/zishan-khan-md/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/zishan-khan-md/"}' href="https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/zishan-khan-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zishan Khan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified psychiatrist with Mindpath Health, who notes that creatine has shown “mixed or null effects on broader executive functions in healthy, rested adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, creatine’s potential to pick up the slack when your brain is tired or stressed (or a bit of both) is well worth &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/realPatrickJr/status/1952022908748075072" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/realPatrickJr/status/1952022908748075072"}' href="https://x.com/realPatrickJr/status/1952022908748075072" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the hype&lt;/a&gt;

published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Experimental Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, which found creatine to significantly improve short-term memory and reasoning, and, more recently, a 2024 &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972/full" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972/full"}' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;study review&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at Guizhou Normal University in China that identified modest but consistent improvements in processing speed and focus. “Each of these studies helps validate creatine’s role as a nootropic in cognitively stressed brains,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, researchers continue to surface new brain health benefits, like this promising 2023 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37368234/"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that uncovered creatine’s potential to mitigate the effects of depression, anxiety, and even traumatic brain injuries such as concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much creatine do you need to take in order to reap these brain-boosting benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a daily dose of five grams has been well established as the ideal for improving muscular strength and size, the precise serving of creatine required to capitalize on the mental benefits is yet to be determined, although it’s likely considerably higher. “This is because the creatine must pass through the blood-brain barrier,” which presents a tougher hurdle than skeletal muscle tissue, says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://cfnmedicine.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cfnmedicine.com/"}' href="https://cfnmedicine.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Leigh Erin Connealy, MD&lt;/a&gt;, medical director at the Center for New Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:06:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9pNzd6cllvckNLa016UzVNeWw3aEk3bXM1X1lFckRwQXVhT2t3dVFYcmppLVJrdm13WWt6Sk5CbE9uZnlkT3NOenAzRFlLQV9pVGJFU01FMnlOWFZiUm1KeUZQV0xOb1d3WXRfVkpEbEgtOEVxOEl3Wg</guid></item><item><title>首次测量Mounjaro对大脑“渴望”的影响- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/mounjaros-effect-on-brains-cravings-measured-for-the-first-time</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Popular drugs for diabetes and weight loss, like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, can have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-just-weight-loss-8-conditions-drugs-like-wegovy-might-treat"&gt;profound impacts&lt;/a&gt; on the body, but what about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-type-drugs-may-trigger-brain-changes-linked-to-depression"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medicines are thought to broadly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/staggering-results-of-new-weight-loss-drugs-may-be-revolutionary-expert-says"&gt;suppress appetite&lt;/a&gt; and enhance feelings of fullness, but the actual way they achieve that in the human brain is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first in-human investigation of its kind has found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirzepatide"&gt;tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; (brand name: Mounjaro) may modulate a specific brain signal, possibly involved in dysregulated eating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-like-ozempic-quieten-food-noise-in-our-brains-study-finds"&gt;Drugs Like Ozempic Quieten 'Food Noise,' in Our Brains, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study included three participants with severe obesity who had difficulty controlling their eating habits and hadn't responded to previous &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-2-crucial-things-to-track-for-lasting-weight-loss"&gt;weight loss treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When participants were dealing with intense thoughts of food or cravings, researchers found a part of their brains, called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"&gt;nucleus accumbens,&lt;/a&gt; produced stronger delta-theta signals. These signals are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1712214114"&gt;involved&lt;/a&gt; in the reward system of the mammal brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All three patients had previously received &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/analysis-of-weight-loss-surgery-data-reveals-there-are-actually-4-types-of-obesity"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt;, yet they continued to experience distressing food preoccupation. Two of the participants began &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01941-w"&gt;deep-brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; of the nucleus accumbens, while the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;third participant had been prescribed tirzepatide for their type 2 diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rain activity was measured in all three participants using electrodes that had been inserted into their nucleus accumbens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the third participant had their tirzepatide dose upped around the same time as their brain implant surgery. For the next four months, not counting the first, the patient experienced a "profoundly" low number of 'severe food preoccupation' episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, when she did have food cravings, the delta–theta activity in her nucleus accumbens was indistinguishable from times when 'food noise' wasn't experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was markedly different from the other participants. But the benefits sadly didn't last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181149" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-642x312.png" alt="Tirzepatide Timeline" class="size-medium wp-image-181149" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-642x312.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-1200x583.png 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-768x373.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-1536x747.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide-600x292.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TimelineTirzepatide.png 2032w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181149" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The third participant started taking tirzepatide for their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="181128" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; 4 months before they had a brain implant inserted.

What scientists can glean from the results without a control group is limited.

During the brighter seasons I feel fine, but when winter comes and the light begins to fade, I start drooping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I have struggled with seasonal affective disorder (Sad) since I was a teenager. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/overview/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;symptoms of Sad&lt;/a&gt; are similar to regular depression, with low moods and lethargy, and can be equally debilitating. Over the years I’ve experienced the full Sad spectrum, from moments of excessive tiredness and carb cravings (yes, those are official Sad symptoms), to a low point of breaking down crying on the kitchen floor after school because it was so cold, dark and bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’ve always struggled to enjoy the cosiness of early winter when Sad feels like a curse waiting to pounce, like an inevitable winter bug that lasts all season. But maybe it didn’t have to be this way? Sick of losing months of my life to the gloom every winter, one year I decided to do a deep dive into the science of Sad and even spoke to a serious-faced Finnish scientist about it for a feature I was writing. His advice? Sit yourself down in front of a light box emitting 10,000 lux, for up to an hour, at least five times a week. Eight out of 10 people will have good results with this, the Finn explained, and you should start a couple of weeks before the symptoms usually kick in. And do it in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="af77d3c5-4620-4137-8d8d-85b41cf4b6b8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The stock advice for Sad is to ‘get light’.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: courtesy of Jessica Furseth&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At first it seemed too simple – the stock advice for Sad is to “get light”, but I’d tried Sad lamps and lunchtime walks before, with little success. But I didn’t realise the timing is so crucial: you have to get that light into your eyeballs soon after waking – before 10am – because the whole point is to help your circadian rhythm. The darkness sets people with Sad adrift because our bodies can’t keep track of the time, and the body clock affects so much, from hormones, hunger, digestion and immune function to alertness, memory and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was desperate, so I decided to follow the instructions to the letter. I bought new bulbs for my 10-year-old Sad lamps and rigged them up on either side of myself in a window seat that gets the morning sun, or at least an overcast approximation. Last winter I sat myself down there first thing every morning to read a book in the blinding light, coffee in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was honestly shocked how well it worked. I still had the occasional gloomy day, but thanks to my new light routine, I mostly felt like myself. Instead of sinking into tiredness as the afternoons grew shorter, I was ready to take on the day. I could skip the occasional morning without any ill effects, but I soon felt myself drawn to the light because I knew it would brighten me up, especially on a rainy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As winter progressed I realised the light went far beyond just giving me energy to get through the day – I also had the energy to have fun. Instead of preferring a blanket on the sofa most January nights, I found myself keen to go out for dinners and dancing on the weekends. Best of all, I was able to appreciate how beautiful winter can be, when you’re awake enough to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now winter is almost here again, I’m back in front of the bright window, and I’m no longer afraid of the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxNQ3NkU1VaaXJtS2JXeFA3eTcwRGtHbE5JQVVFbTRLeHZOMjQxZHFVejV1M2w2VVFMZGIzLVZCZDFSLUdiZGN5bW5TWWJvNG4tQzQzd3pQN2pSLTNzdVBleDl2VGpyVWlxekZqTk0wLV9zX1pBRkVaZjJlSnlRUUVjV2k5OUZjTjQ0SUttdHFJNVgyMHFmWUJIX3ZxV1FFODk2TGZUay1WN3IwZUJBdGNSTGRzUndabFZ0WDNmMDZEVjBIajRsUDVZU3lrTnZLaGJpR0FJc3NENWRPQ1ZhYmFnSUJTaFU5Mkkydm9WUA</guid></item><item><title>全脂乳制品更健康吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/well/eat/whole-milk-dairy-health-effects.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:35:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQZnByX0RqajdzOXRWaW9EOUk2QlMyaEszalVpTkNYVzR0ZVFRWlhrYWtxaTNaZTJYX3hJc3FCZzBSelAtcl9rLWU3aFVrY3poRFBoc1lTNEVHanhVTndwZ0pNSXdiVVhCUkl2NVlUNFY3a2U4WGpnTmxPR0RiMGxkd1Uzak1NX3M</guid></item><item><title>世界上第一个，以色列科学家使用基于RNA的基因疗法来阻止ALS恶化-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-world-first-israeli-scientists-use-rna-based-gene-therapy-to-stop-als-deterioration/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study, researchers at Tel Aviv University, leading a large-scale international team of scientists, say they have identified – and neutralized – an RNA molecule that can stop the nerve cell damage that causes paralysis in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now they hope they can use the discovery to help patients with the fatal illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we added a specific RNA molecule to human cells and animal models for ALS, the nerve cells stopped degenerating and even regenerated,” said Prof. Eran Perlson from the Gray Faculty of Medical &amp;amp; Health Sciences and the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University, speaking to The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Their study, recently published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02062-6"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, opens a new avenue for treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get to the root of the matter of what causes ALS to enable the development of effective drugs for this incurable disease,” Perlson said. The team used mice that had been genetically modified to serve as a “biological stand-in” for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="In world first, Israeli scientists use RNA-based gene therapy to stop ALS deterioration"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Ariel Ionescu, Dr. Lior Ankol, and lab manager Tal Pery Gradus in collaboration with Dr. Amir Dori, Senior Neurologist and Head of the Neuromuscular Disease Unit at Sheba Medical Center. Additional participants included researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and research institutions in France, Turkey, and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About ALS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative condition that affects motor neurons — the nerve cells that control muscle movement. Over time, the disease causes gradual paralysis of all muscles in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients typically lose their ability to walk, speak, swallow, and breathe, often becoming completely paralyzed while their cognitive skills remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“Most patients die within three to five years of diagnosis, due to paralysis of the diaphragm muscles and respiratory failure,” said Perlson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently some 600 ALS patients in Israel, according to &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/circumventing-israeli-law-judge-okays-als-patients-right-to-die/"&gt;Efrat Carmi&lt;/a&gt;, CEO for IsrALS, the Israeli Research Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ALS, the neuromuscular junctions, where nerve fibers meet muscle cells and transmit electrical signals from the brain to the muscles, are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perlson stated that the molecular mechanisms underlying this damage had remained unknown until now.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The microRNA that causes trouble in ALS patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study continues research from Perlson’s lab about microRNAs, the small molecules that regulate the translation of proteins and play an important role in many other cellular processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-scientists-say-step-taken-toward-finding-treatment-of-lou-gehrig-disease/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Perlson and his team found that a protein called TDP-43 formed toxic clusters at the tip of the nerve, where it meets the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;In healthy bodies, the TDP-43 helps regulate how proteins are made in cells. But in ALS, it becomes unstable. To find out why this happens, the researchers studied tissues from ALS patients, mice that mimic having the disease, and human stem cell cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their experiments revealed that muscle cells produce tiny RNA molecules called microRNA-126.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The muscle cells then send them in tiny bubbles, called vesicles, across the small gap between nerve and muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These microRNAs act like messengers that tell the nerve cells when to stop making TDP-43. Without the microRNA, TDP-43 continues to build up and becomes toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that in ALS, the muscle produces a smaller amount of microRNA-126,” said Ionescu. The decrease in this microRNA leads to an increase in the dangerous TDP-43.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excessive TDP-43 then forms toxic clusters. These clumps attack the mitochondria, the essential molecules inside cells that turn food and oxygen into energy so the cell can work, move, and stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage is so great that it gradually destroys motor neurons, “leaving patients’ muscles paralyzed,” Ionescu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the researchers added extra microRNA-126 to tissues from ALS patients and to mice with the disease, the process reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zevik Melamed, the principal investigator at the Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Neuroscience at Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Faculty of Medicine, said the study “suggests that protecting communication between muscles and nerves might be just as important as targeting neurons directly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a real shift in how we think about preventing paralysis in ALS,” Melamed, who was not involved in the study, told The Times of Israel in a written comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study can be the basis for gene therapy for ALS, Perlson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next step is taking it to clinical trials,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2839019" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, identifies a specific bacterium that may play a part in this relationship, offering a new perspective on how dietary choices can influence mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human gut is home to trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiome. This internal ecosystem communicates with the brain through a complex network of signals, often called the gut-brain axis. The composition of these microbial communities can influence mood, behavior, and brain function. This connection has led researchers to explore how external factors, like diet, might impact mental health by first changing the gut environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has already connected soft drink consumption with a range of negative physical health outcomes. Separately, other studies have shown that the gut microbiomes of individuals with depression can differ from those without the condition. For instance, experiments involving the transfer of gut microbes from depressed human patients to rodents have induced behaviors in the animals that resemble anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large, collaborative team of researchers from institutions primarily in Marburg, Münster, and Frankfurt, Germany, sought to bring these lines of inquiry together. They aimed to investigate if there was a direct link between soft drink intake and diagnosed depression, and if the gut microbiome could be the biological mechanism explaining such a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their investigation, the researchers drew upon data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Disorders Cohort Study. This provided them with a large sample of 932 participants, which included 405 patients who had a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and 527 healthy control individuals. The two groups were comparable in age and sex distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ dietary habits were assessed using a detailed food frequency questionnaire. This tool asked them to report how often they consumed a standard portion of various foods and drinks, including soft drinks like lemonade and cola, over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the severity of depressive symptoms, individuals completed the Beck Depression Inventory, a standardized self-report questionnaire. In addition, stool samples were collected from a subset of participants to analyze the composition of their gut microbiomes. The team used a genetic sequencing technique known as 16S ribosomal RNA analysis, which allows for the identification and quantification of different types of bacteria present in a sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial analysis examined the direct relationship between soft drink consumption and depression. The results showed that higher intake of soft drinks was associated with a diagnosis of MDD. This connection appeared to be driven primarily by female participants; in women, higher consumption was linked to an increased likelihood of having an MDD diagnosis, while no such effect was observed in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern emerged when the researchers looked at symptom severity. In the entire sample, greater soft drink intake was associated with more severe depressive symptoms. When the data was separated by sex, this association remained strong for women but was not statistically significant for men. This sex-specific finding prompted the team to focus their subsequent microbiome analyses exclusively on the female participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data suggests that the relation between soft drinks and depressive symptoms arises via the influence of the microbiome,” said Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah, the study’s lead author from the University Hospital Frankfurt and the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research in Cologne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to see if soft drinks affected the gut microbiome in a way that could explain the link to depression. Building on previous work that identified two bacterial genera, Eggerthella and Hungatella, as being potentially related to MDD, the team tested whether soft drink consumption was associated with the abundance of these specific microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that in women, higher soft drink intake was indeed linked to a greater abundance of Eggerthella. No such link was found with Hungatella. The analysis also revealed that higher soft drink consumption was associated with lower overall microbial diversity, which can be an indicator of a less resilient gut ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these pieces in place, the researchers performed a mediation analysis. This statistical method tests a hypothesized chain of events to see if the data is consistent with it. The proposed model was that soft drink consumption influences the abundance of Eggerthella, which in turn influences the risk and severity of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis supported this model for female participants. The abundance of Eggerthella was found to explain a small but statistically significant portion of the total effect of soft drink consumption on both MDD diagnosis (about 3.8%) and symptom severity (about 5.0%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that sugary drinks can disrupt the balance of the gut microbiome, favoring the growth of certain bacteria. “Changes in the microbiome can be influenced by diet and are therefore a potential therapeutic target,” explained Edwin Thanarajah. “Even small adjustments in consumer behavior might have a big impact, especially when considering the widespread consumption of soft drinks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study presents a detailed picture, it has several important limitations. As an observational study, it can identify associations but cannot prove that soft drink consumption causes depression. The relationship could be bidirectional. Ciara McCabe, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Reading who was not involved in the study, noted this point. “Simply, those with depression could drink more soft drinks,” McCabe told &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-on-association-between-soft-drink-consumption-and-depression-mediated-by-gut-microbiome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;. “As the authors say themselves depression is associated with increased emotional eating and preference for high sugar food, which may lead to greater soft drink consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportion of the effect explained by the microbiome was also modest. Guillaume Meric, an associate professor at the University of Bath, commented on this aspect. “The microbiome mediation is statistically significant but explains only about 4–5% of the association, which makes it an interesting hypothesis to validate with further studies,” he said. The authors contend that even mediators with small effects can be meaningful in complex systems, as they might point toward pathways that are easier to modify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other experts pointed to potential confounding factors. Andrew McQuillin, a professor of molecular psychiatry at University College London, questioned the strength of the evidence. “The effect sizes reported are very small with wide confidence intervals and the findings have not been replicated in an independent study,” he remarked. The reliance on self-reported dietary information could also introduce inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will be needed to untangle the direction of these relationships and confirm the findings. Randomized controlled trials, while challenging in dietary research, would provide stronger evidence of a causal link. Further investigation is also required to understand the sex-specific nature of the findings, which could involve hormonal differences or other biological factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the study adds to a body of evidence suggesting that diet is an important, modifiable factor in mental health. Rachel Lippert, a researcher from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrücke and a co-author of the study, sees potential in these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microbiome-based approaches such as targeted nutritional therapies or probiotic strategies might help to effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in the future,” she said. The work suggests that public health strategies aimed at reducing soft drink intake could have benefits that extend beyond physical health to include mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2839019" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Soft Drink Consumption and Depression Mediated by Gut Microbiome Alterations&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah, Adèle H.

Her diagnosis wasn’t good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, everything seemed fine – until she was 2 months old. Then, the problems began: Alex was crying 20-22 hours a day; she was having trouble digesting milk – and when her parents took her to the hospital, the reason became clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex had no brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, to be more accurate, she had no &lt;em&gt;cerebrum&lt;/em&gt;. She was born with a disease called hydranencephaly, where the biggest, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-our-brains-got-their-wrinkles-25414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wrinkly&lt;/a&gt;, most “brain” bit of the brain never develops. Her doctors told her parents that she would likely not live past 6 months old – and, indeed, that’s usually what happens for babies with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Simpson and her family celebrated her 20th birthday this year. But what is this rare disease she’s lived with? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is hydranencephaly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you visualize a brain, most of what you’re imagining is in fact just one part of it: the cerebrum. It’s admittedly a very &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; part – it’s what gives us thoughts and consciousness, among other things – but it’s not the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to appreciate in humans, because our cerebra are just so overgrown and bulbous compared to everything else, but there’s actually two other pieces of brain nestled underneath there. Right at the back, underneath the cerebrum, there’s the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-cerebellum-helps-to-recall-emotional-events-a-newly-revealed-function-65893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt; – Latin for “little brain”, this is the bit that regulates and fine-tunes movement and motor skills – and even deeper than that, the tiny &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/covid-19-damages-a-major-brain-control-center-ultra-powerful-mri-scans-reveal-76273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, where the body’s most basic functions are taken care of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="87554" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;The three parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-reference"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credit: Blausen.com staff (2014).

By four weeks’ gestation, the neural plate – the precursor to the nervous system – has already developed; within two or three weeks from that, there’s already a rudimentary brain, with distinct fore, mid, and hind sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s after this that things start to go wrong for fetuses with hydranencephaly. Normally, starting in the seventh week, those three basic divisions start to specialize further: the hindbrain births the metencephalon and myelencephalon, and the forebrain becomes the diencephalon and the cerebrum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes – very rarely – that doesn’t happen. For whatever reason, instead, the cerebrum fails to develop; babies with hydranencephaly are born with only the cerebellum and brainstem, with the rest of the cranium filled by sacs of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/snoozing-mice-reveal-one-neurotransmitter-is-crucial-for-the-brains-inbuilt-washing-machine-77541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosis and prognosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydranencephaly is very rare – it only occurs in around one in every 50,000 live births. Partly, that’s just its nature – scientists estimate it only occurs in about one in 10,000 pregnancies at all; partly, though, it’s because the majority of fetuses with the disorder never survive the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of us with the benefit of modern medicine, the discovery of hydranencephaly in a fetus often happens early. Diagnoses can be made using an ultrasound scan, which most expectant mothers would receive as routine care: “Performed during the 21 to 23 weeks of gestation,” notes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558991/" target="_blank"&gt;one 2023 writeup&lt;/a&gt; of the condition, this technique would reveal the “absence of cerebral hemispheres, replaced with homogeneous echoic material” and the preservation of other brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although most commonly used during pregnancy, this test can be also used during the postnatal period to obtain a diagnosis,” the authors add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course, this isn’t foolproof. Fetuses with hydranencephaly often exhibit normal movements from the mother’s perspective, and that pattern can continue after the birth: babies with the condition &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22799-hydranencephaly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;might appear typical at first&lt;/a&gt;, and diagnosis isn’t made until weeks or even months later, once symptoms become obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other times, it’s evident right from the start. The baby will be born with an enlarged head; soon, they can start to seize and spasm, crying far more than typical babies and feeding poorly. They &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/failure-to-thrive" target="_blank"&gt;fail to thrive&lt;/a&gt;, and rarely live past the first year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precisely how long any patient can live depends on how much of their brain is present and working – “The more developed your baby's brain is, the greater chance they might have to live past infancy,” as &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-hydranencephaly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; neatly summarizes. In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1769721222002403" target="_blank"&gt;one case&lt;/a&gt;, a woman born with the condition lived to 33 years old, but she never learned to walk and was fully dependent on caregivers; &lt;a href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(21)01019-4/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;another woman&lt;/a&gt; reached at least the age of 32, and could walk, but never learned to talk or use the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median age of survival with hydranencephaly is under 8 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has Alex Simpson survived so long?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the few people to have lived with hydranencephaly for more than two decades, then, it’s clear that Alex Simpson is a notable individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her diagnosis, made two months after she was born, “means that her brain is not there, not half a brain, her whole brain,” Alex's father, Shawn Simpson, &lt;a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/omaha-family-daughter-born-with-nearly-no-brain/69274152" target="_blank"&gt;told Omaha’s KETV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Technically, she has about half the size of my pinky finger of her cerebellum in the back part of her brain, but that's all that's there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simpson’s life is one that requires round-the-clock care: &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3401941/Little-girl-no-brain-celebrates-10th-birthday-t-wouldn-t-live-past-six-months-old.html" target="_blank"&gt;she has&lt;/a&gt; a feeding tube in her stomach and a tracheostomy tube in her throat; she can’t control her jaw or tongue, and so risks choking if she lays down at the wrong angle; she requires valium to fall asleep at night. She has, at most, impaired hearing and vision, even if her cerebellum does allow her some awareness of her surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She knows her mum and her dad, her little brother,” Shawn Simpson &lt;a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/nebraska-baby-born-with-nearly-no-brain-still-alive-10-years-later/7203181" target="_blank"&gt;told KETV back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. “She knows when good things are going on around us, she knows when bad things are going on around her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does hydranencephaly occur?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alex, as for all babies with hydranencephaly, this kind of intense care is the only treatment they will see. There’s no cure for hydranencephaly; no way to regrow or develop a patient’s missing brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the parents involved, one question must surely add to the already overwhelming stress: &lt;em&gt;did I cause this&lt;/em&gt;? And the answer, most likely, is “no”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we are still learning, hydranencephaly is presumed to be a destructive process impacting the brain," Sumit Parikh, a pediatric neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic, told &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/generalneurology/118474" target="_blank"&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/a&gt; – and it’s “commonly due to a variety of causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But exactly what those causes are, we don’t really know. It could be due to a freak infection in utero; it could be due to an environmental toxin like cocaine. Sometimes, it can occur due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, an extremely rare situation in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Simpson’s case, her doctors believe it was caused by a stroke in the womb. This, they think, cut off the oxygen supply to her developing brain – and, indeed, hydranencephaly is believed to usually be traced back to an interruption to the brain’s oxygen supply like this. That’s often due to a blocking of the carotid arteries; sometimes, the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-human-mini-brains-combine-cells-from-the-whole-brain-even-the-blood-vessels-80227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; simply can’t deliver enough oxygen for some reason. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Less commonly, genetic disorders impacting cerebral blood vessel formation have been identified,” said Parikh. “Considering we have not had comprehensive testing like whole-genome sequencing until relatively recently, it is possible that genetic causes have been underestimated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the cause, though, there’s little that parents can do to change their child’s chances of having hydranencephaly. Nevertheless, when it happens, it’s “extremely difficult,” notes the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22799-hydranencephaly" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “Families need education to understand how severe the disorder is.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:06:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPNi1ZaFctQm9ucFV1Y2c3Um1RM1hWZHl3a1JaRWxkY1h1VTZwQ055SmZqNTVDMnlMMUo4RjdlVkJtTXNPcERYLWpPWXB2U2RMMkpjQV84T2ZDYldLVXllMHA1SnltSEloWldJOGVtVDhRcXliWVFveDEtZmJ0LVVrei1Fc0lGSDJoeGxqdmNWV29iSzRiUFpMNFNLUUNBaDdyU2g2RFBXU3NzVWdEeGxMelhTYUQxbGd6bzlRWWNDOW1qc28</guid></item><item><title>里奇兰县鹿场在CWD病例后被隔离- 3000频道</title><link>https://www.channel3000.com/news/richland-county-deer-farm-quarantined-after-cwd-case/article_e0ca0248-f536-4ebc-a2e6-90ad07639c47.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

A research team from Monash University analyzed data from more than 10,800 older adults and found that people in this age group who regularly listened to music experienced a 39 percent lower likelihood of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, led by Monash honours student Emma Jaffa and Professor Joanne Ryan, examined how both listening to music and playing instruments relate to cognitive health in adults over 70. Their analysis showed that individuals who consistently listened to music, compared with those who never, rarely, or only sometimes did so, had a 39 percent reduced risk of dementia. Playing an instrument was also tied to benefits, with a 35 percent reduction in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Drawn From Large-Scale Aging Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers based their work on information from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study and the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP) sub‐study. The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who reported always listening to music demonstrated the strongest cognitive advantages. This group showed a 39 percent lower incidence of dementia and a 17 percent lower incidence of cognitive impairment, along with higher overall cognitive scores and better episodic memory (used when recalling everyday events). Those who both listened to and played music on a regular basis had a 33 percent reduced risk of dementia and a 22 percent reduced risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music as an Accessible Activity for Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jaffa noted that the outcomes of the research "suggests music activities may be an accessible strategy for maintaining cognitive health in older adults, though causation cannot be established," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings come at a time when population aging is creating new public health challenges. Longer life expectancy has led to rising rates of age‐related conditions, including cognitive decline and dementia, which places increasing pressure on families and healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Choices May Shape Cognitive Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author Professor Ryan emphasized the urgency of exploring options to help delay or prevent dementia. "With no cure currently available for dementia, the importance of identifying strategies to help prevent or delay onset of the disease is critical," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that "Evidence suggests that brain aging is not just based on age and genetics but can be influenced by one's own environmental and lifestyle choices. Our study suggests that lifestyle-based interventions, such as listening and/or playing music can promote cognitive health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Some women rush to their doctor just days after getting a positive pregnant test, but Dr. L. Joy Baker said she often sees patients for the first time just weeks or even days before they give birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqyd000a3b6newqk1i57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At least once a week,” a woman may start prenatal care well into their second or third trimester of pregnancy, said Baker, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in LaGrange, Georgia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqyd000b3b6n24wyfjkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I accept patients up until delivery, and sometimes there are patients that we have not seen at all, and they are in their third trimester, or they’re even 39 weeks,” Baker said. “I’ve done initial prenatal visits at 39 weeks and the patient delivered a week later.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqyd000c3b6n3msxzc4w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Starting prenatal care after the first trimester of pregnancy appears to be a growing yet dangerous trend in the United States, according to a new report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000d3b6nm702nh7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/about/news/us-earns-d-fourth-year-march-dimes-2025-report-card" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, released Monday by the infant and maternal health nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/index.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;March of Dimes&lt;/a&gt;, says that only about 75% of babies last year were born to mothers who started prenatal care in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the first trimester of pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000g3b6nsh9gt3e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve always known that getting that prenatal care started early is important,” said Dr. Michael Warren, March of Dimes’ chief medical and health officer. He added that now, in the United States, it’s moving in the “wrong direction.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000h3b6nfjo1dbtp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a quarter of women in this country, the first visit is not happening in the first trimester,” he said, which has been part of a &lt;a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/about/news/us-earns-d-fourth-year-march-dimes-2025-report-card" target="_blank"&gt;four-year decline&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000i3b6n271a7obw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Starting prenatal care early is vital because it “gives us the longest possible window to be able to understand how we can best support the health of that pregnant mom, whether it’s addressing chronic diseases that she might have and making sure those are appropriately managed or identifying risk factors,” Warren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziypcx001t3b6nfo4o6sbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Warren identified several systemic barriers that are preventing women from starting or maintaining prenatal care. Areas where there is limited or no access to maternity care, known as maternity care deserts, are one major driving force.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzjeqpc002w3b6nz4nrm2pv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/health/maternity-care-crisis-march-of-dimes"&gt;a third of counties in the United States&lt;/a&gt; do not have an ob/gyn, a family physician or a certified nurse-midwife. These counties also do not have birthing facilities or centers in hospitals, Warren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000j3b6n8qk8463b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those counties are home to over 2 million women of reproductive age and about 150,000 births every year in the United States,” he said. “If you live in one of those counties, you’re going to have to drive farther to get prenatal care, and when your baby is coming, you have longer to go to be able to find a place that can actually deliver.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmhzjc7vg002q3b6n68bo7w45@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-major-risk-to-mom-and-baby" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A major risk to mom and baby
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000l3b6n6ctf671t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest findings come as no surprise to Baker.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000m3b6ngo9629mc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of times, when I see patients who are second and third trimester, I always ask, ‘What kept you from getting in? What was your barrier?’ They often tell me, ‘I had trouble getting my Medicaid,’ or ‘I was moving around a lot,’ or ‘I had housing insecurity or food insecurity,’” Baker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000n3b6ncr765u1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are a variety of reasons why folks may present late to care,” she said. “But when they have chronic conditions or even conditions that started in the pregnancy – like preeclampsia or gestational diabetes – the earlier that we know, the better we’re able to treat.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000o3b6nw2sczx94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why inadequate or delayed prenatal care can put women at risk of complications or even death, and it plays a big role in the current state of maternal health in the United States, Baker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000p3b6nnbl0eadw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a doctor practicing in a small town, I definitely understand that there are often barriers to care for women who have become pregnant,” she said. “There are also barriers to care for women before they become pregnant, which I think may be even more of an issue.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000q3b6n9hj70hg8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Addressing these barriers to care remain vital for improving maternal health, she said, adding that care should start well before pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000r3b6nn7exefxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s the one area where we could really make a plan to prevent severe morbidity and mortality,” she said. “I think this is an area we need to divert more resources to.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000s3b6n5c03dz0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, Baker said, she treated a woman who came to her office for a first prenatal visit at 37 weeks, and the patient had high blood sugar levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000t3b6ndov5kvin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were doing just her initial lab work at 37 weeks, and she had a blood glucose of nearly 300,” Baker said, which was a serious concern for the health of both the mother and the baby. A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/diabetes-testing/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or above&lt;/a&gt; is typically indicative of diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000u3b6nht280qnd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We basically just needed to induce her labor right away because her sugars were so uncontrolled, which was an independent risk factor for stillbirth and a significant risk to her health, as well,” Baker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000v3b6n5vg3qldl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Had we seen her early and diagnosed her diabetes prior to pregnancy, we could have treated her, helped her control her sugars and significantly reduce the risk to mom and baby,” Baker said. “Consistent, high-quality care would have been a much better experience for her versus walking into the office one day and then being told to report to the hospital for delivery the next.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000x3b6n7w13imfu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Inadequate prenatal care can often lead to pregnancy or childbirth complications for both the mother and the baby, including preterm birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi0k7mf500053b6neppk2v0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
             The new March of Dimes report gives the United States a D+ grade for having a preterm birth rate of 10.4% for the third year in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi0jyzs400003b6nxs4ew61a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sadly, I actually have to say that there was nothing that surprised us” in the new report, said Divya Sooryakumar, the vice president of programs and impact of the maternal health nonprofit Every Mother Counts, who was not involved in the report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye000z3b6ncrellh44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One thing that I really appreciated about this year’s report was the bifurcation of the impact on preterm birth by insurance type, because that’s something that we’ve seen for a long time,” Sooryakumar said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzkrocd00033b6qmu0x99hm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She was glad this year’s report “spelled out very clearly how pregnant people on Medicaid are disproportionately impacted by the maternal health care crisis in this country.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00183b6nr5t1594f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And many women may delay care because they are not sure whether the care will be fully or partially covered by their Medicaid insurance or other insurance providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00193b6nciik8oi1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Where we need to start is reimbursing prenatal care and postpartum care through Medicaid for what it actually costs to do the work. Historically, that work has been chronically under-reimbursed,” Sooryakumar said. “And it creates an incentive for systems and those delivering care to not actually take Medicaid, and then those populations continue to face the brunt of the disparities in the system.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye001a3b6n427pdt9x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This gap in adequate care can be seen in preterm birth rates, according to the new March of Dimes report, which says that between 2022 and 2024, the preterm birth rate among mothers with private insurance was 9.6%. Among mothers using Medicaid, it was 11.7%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye001b3b6nme103pt8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medicaid covers more than 40% of births in the United States, Warren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00103b6nka9cpn0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For many women, especially those in maternity care deserts, even getting to a provider can be a major roadblock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00173b6nt3sg31x9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among its other efforts, the nonprofit organization Every Mother Counts supports a group of midwives in New Mexico who serve indigenous patients. Because of the lack of infrastructure in that area, the group’s radius for care is up to a four-hour drive. Some patients who are in labor or need prenatal care will get in their car and drive those four hours for these appointments, Sooryakumar said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi0kf0tk000a3b6nvep2c4ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also may be difficult for patients to be seen by a provider. “We know that there are all sorts of delays due to workforce shortages and shrinkage,” she said. For instance, a report published last year by the &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage" target="_blank"&gt;Association of American Medical Colleges&lt;/a&gt; projects that the nation will face a physician shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00113b6nqrxfpc1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sooryakumar added that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/dobbs-mississippi-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade"&gt;US Supreme Court’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dobbs decision in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, which overturned the right to an abortion, also appears to affect patients’ abilities to see a provider. For instance, some providers in states with more restrictive abortion laws&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have turned away patients in the first trimester “because there is a fear that if a patient miscarries, it will be labeled as an abortion or investigated as an abortion,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00123b6n09vxvaii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another barrier to care can be how safe patients feel to seek it, especially among immigrant, mixed-status or undocumented families. “During times of immigration crackdown, that is when families will delay prenatal care,” Sooryakumar said, referring to it as a cycle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00143b6n6dql0cp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2018, during the era of family separation and especially now, families go into hiding, and what that means is later and later access to prenatal care,” she said. “So what we’ve been seeing, especially over the last few years, is that all three of these factors – getting to a provider, being seen by a provider, and feeling safe, seeking care – are all systematically breaking down at the same time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye00153b6n967kh1pv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Incentive and reporting structures for &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federally-qualified-health-center-fqhc/" target="_blank"&gt;Federally Qualified Health Centers&lt;/a&gt;, which provide care to underserved communities, can also play a role in delayed care, Sooryakumar added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi0kcuol00083b6n7oz41mhy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These measures are designed to encourage early prenatal care, but an unintended consequence is that some clinics may be less able or less likely to accept patients who arrive later in pregnancy. As a result, women who seek care in the third trimester can be turned away, Sooryakumar said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye001d3b6n3i1enhfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Having accessible health care before pregnancy is crucial,” Warren said. “It allows people to receive routine preventive visits, screening for conditions, identification and treatment of chronic diseases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhziqqye001j3b6njfuaexkm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women who have chronic diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity are at “a greater risk for having a baby born preterm,” he said. And that remains a major driving force as to why the highest rates of preterm birth are concentrated in the Southeast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzj653p002f3b6nwou94zmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The Southeast is one of those areas where we have higher rates of chronic disease, for example. So it’s not surprising that those preterm birth rates are the way they are,” Warren said, adding that this is compounded by a concentration of maternity care deserts in Southeast counties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzizr6800233b6nminb8pct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But some states have been successful in improving preterm birth rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi0lb107000g3b6nzz72mm93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Warren pointed to Tennessee, where there was a high percentage of women who smoked before and during pregnancy. Smoking is a risk factor for preterm birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzj6tsz002h3b6nkj6g5ztz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They really have worked to make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/fhw/tennessee-tobacco-program/pregnancy-smoking-cessation/how-the-program-works.html" target="_blank"&gt;women to quit smoking&lt;/a&gt; and are doing a combination of educational programs and incentives, and work to make sure that it’s easy for them to quit smoking and that they’re supported in that journey along smoking cessation,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi0lhos9000i3b6nwr2euds2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research has associated the state’s smoking cessation program for pregnant women with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10995-016-2166-y" target="_blank"&gt;better pregnancy outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, including a significantly reduced risk of having an infant with a low birth weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzizr6800243b6nco04di6z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the Midwest, Illinois recognized that pregnant women may often face challenges such as poverty or housing and food insecurity, which can impact their access to care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzj77m4002j3b6nd80en680@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’ve instituted &lt;a href="https://hfs.illinois.gov/medicalproviders/maternalandchildhealth/familycasemanagement.html" target="_blank"&gt;case management programs&lt;/a&gt; where they actually have folks who will work with women during pregnancy, particularly women who are at high risk of having worse pregnancy outcomes,” Warren said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzizr6800253b6n76rd3s9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But to address the overall maternal health crisis, Warren said, there must be a national effort to ensure that women have insurance coverage across their lives and the country must “maintain a really robust public health infrastructure.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzizr6800263b6nv934xv6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He warned that should the trend of inadequate prenatal care continue, more mothers will not be there to celebrate their babies’ first birthdays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhzj958o002l3b6nlmx6p6x4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every year in this country, we lose over 20,000 babies in [the] first year of life. We lose over 600 moms, either during pregnancy or delivery, or during that first year postpartum,” Warren said. “That is not acceptable in the United States in 2025, and unless we change our course, those numbers are not going to get better. They’re going to get worse.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

And recently, it has been found to have a different effect on yet another part of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Hearing loss can be inherited through a mutation of a gene known as CPD. It secretes an enzyme that helps synthesize the amino acid arginine, which is involved in producing nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter that zaps signals from &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a43266443/fruit-fly-brain/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a43266443/fruit-fly-brain/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="neuron" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;neuron&lt;/a&gt; to neuron and through the entire nervous system. What was previously unknown is that it is also linked to inner ear functions. An international team of researchers, led by Rong Grace Zhai from the University of Chicago, began to suspect something when they saw that the same CPD mutations ran in three unrelated families affected by sensorineural hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a genetic condition that causes permanent hearing loss, and was long thought to be irreversible. It is also the most widespread type of permanent &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65355214/gene-therapy-reverse-deafness/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65355214/gene-therapy-reverse-deafness/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hearing loss" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;, cause by damage to the cochlea, or auditory nerve. Symptoms usually start at a young age and keep progressing—in fact, the most famous example of this condition might be legendary composer &lt;a href="https://www.entandaudiologynews.com/features/history-of-ent/post/the-dilemma-of-beethoven-s-deafness" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.entandaudiologynews.com/features/history-of-ent/post/the-dilemma-of-beethoven-s-deafness" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ludwig van Beethoven" data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;, whose hearing degenerated until he could no longer hear his own music. The only existing treatments are hearing aids and cochlear implants, but while these may improve hearing, they have no effect on CPD mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Our study identifies CPD as a critical regulator of metabolic signaling, linking arginine and [nitric oxide] to cochlear cell survival,” the researchers wrote in a paper published in &lt;em data-node-id="8.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/192000/192090/cache/192090.1-20250926154728-covered-e0fd13ba177f913fd3156f593ead4cfd.pdf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/192000/192090/cache/192090.1-20250926154728-covered-e0fd13ba177f913fd3156f593ead4cfd.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Journal of Clinical Investigation" data-node-id="8.1.0" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, adding that “Our in vitro and in vivo functional analyses show that dysfunction of CPD causes [nitric oxide] deficiency and apoptosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Analyzing a genetic database, Zhai and her team found more unrelated individuals with CPD mutations who experienced early onset hearing loss.

Because mice have a inner ears comparable to those of humans, they also express CPD throughout the development of the cochlea, which responds to the vibrations of sound by generating nerve signals. It is highly expressed in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11122/#:~:text=The%20cochlear%20hair%20cells%20in,brain%20arise%20from%20this%20subpopulation" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11122/#:~:text=The%20cochlear%20hair%20cells%20in,brain%20arise%20from%20this%20subpopulation" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hair cells" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;hair cells&lt;/a&gt; (which function as sensory receptors), in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3152679/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3152679/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spiral ganglion" data-node-id="9.5" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;spiral ganglion&lt;/a&gt; (a group of neurons that connect sound to perception), and in the &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.841708/full#:~:text=The%20stria%20vascularis%20(SV)%20is,is%20required%20for%20sound%20transduction" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.841708/full#:~:text=The%20stria%20vascularis%20(SV)%20is,is%20required%20for%20sound%20transduction" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stria vascularis" data-node-id="9.7" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;stria vascularis&lt;/a&gt; (tissue that keeps cochlear fluid stable so it can transduce sound).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It turned out that CPD gene mutations in mice disrupted the production of arginine and nitric oxide, along with nitric oxide signaling (mice that had the gene completely deleted did not survive). With these deficits, there was also more cell death, or apoptosis. By injecting mouse cells with arginine, nitric oxide levels were nearly brought back to normal, meaning arginine could potentially do the same in &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69082783/ancient-human-lead-poisoning/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69082783/ancient-human-lead-poisoning/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="humans" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;So, where does Viagra come in? Fruit flies have a gene known as &lt;em data-node-id="12.1"&gt;silver &lt;/em&gt;that is the fly equivalent of mammalian CPD. This gene is highly expressed in the antennae and the Johnston’s organ, which the insects use to sense gravity and hear. Mutations in &lt;em data-node-id="12.3"&gt;silver &lt;/em&gt;can be fatal to fly embryos and larvae, but adult flies with the mutation showed significant hearing impairments and had difficulties with motor coordination and gravity sensing. Mutants were then fed either arginine or both arginine and sildenafil. Arginine improved movement direction more, but feeding both drugs showed a significant improvement in the insects’ ability to sense &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a63231248/kilogram-gravity-measurement/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a63231248/kilogram-gravity-measurement/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gravity" data-node-id="12.5" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;gravity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“The use of cross-species modeling and demonstration of rescue via L-arginine or sildenafil highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the NO pathway,” Zhai &lt;a href="https://dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/192000/192090/cache/192090.1-20250926154728-covered-e0fd13ba177f913fd3156f593ead4cfd.pdf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/192000/192090/cache/192090.1-20250926154728-covered-e0fd13ba177f913fd3156f593ead4cfd.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-1kk1geb emevuu60"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “Future work will focus on developing cellular and vertebrate models for in vivo auditory testing and evaluating combinatorial therapies involving metabolic supplementation and gene delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-16" data-node-id="14" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;div data-node-id="gallery-carousel" aria-label="Gallery Carousel" aria-roledescription="carousel" role="region" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="PP0-16-0" data-theme-key="carousel-container" class="css-12a1wb0 e1kgjrvy4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1t3oi0e e1kgjrvy3"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PP0-16-0" data-theme-key="carousel-hed" class="css-4i2xvz e1kgjrvy5"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-8psjmo eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Exclusive Pop Mech Digital Issues&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-v6ym3h eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4e76c835-faea-430d-b35c-1d6bd85f7d11_1727374181.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Elizabeth Rayne" title="Headshot of Elizabeth Rayne" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1spvhkb ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Rayne is a creature who writes.

A winter chill, a dusty room or a simple viral infection can trigger a cough that settles within a few days. But when that cough lingers long after the usual remedies, it may be signalling something more important than a passing cold. Doctors describe any cough lasting longer than eight weeks in adults as a “chronic cough”, and a peer-reviewed medical review published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430791/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;StatPearls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; highlights that persistent coughing is often linked to hidden issues such as asthma, reflux disease, heart problems, or chronic lung conditions. Ignoring it might delay a diagnosis your body is trying desperately to alert you to. A lingering cough always deserves attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why a lingering cough should never be ignored&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often expect a cough to disappear as quietly as it arrived. But if it stays for weeks or becomes a daily pattern, it is no longer behaving like an ordinary symptom of a cold. According to respiratory experts, a persistent cough can be the first visible sign of issues affecting your lungs, throat, sinuses or even your heart. The reason doctors take chronic cough seriously is simple: the body rarely keeps coughing without a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Understanding what is driving that reflex can prevent more serious complications later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Winter diseases you must be careful about as days get colder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common medical causes behind a cough that won’t go away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cough that refuses to calm down is usually connected to one of several underlying conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Post-nasal drip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinus congestion sends mucus down the back of the throat, irritating the airway and triggering constant throat clearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Asthma and cough variant asthma:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people experience coughing rather than wheezing, making asthma harder to recognise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GERD):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acid rising into the throat can irritate the vocal cords and cause a dry, nagging cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic bronchitis or COPD:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often seen in smokers or former smokers, this involves long term inflammation of the airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lung infections and scarring:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after an infection resolves, leftover inflammation can continue to trigger coughing spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart-related issues:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluid buildup in the lungs from heart failure can cause a persistent, breathless cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding which category your symptoms fall into helps guide proper treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The warning signs that a stubborn cough could be serious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many chronic coughs are linked to treatable causes, certain symptoms should be taken seriously.

Whether the cause is mild or serious, a persistent cough should always be treated as a message worth listening to. Early intervention can prevent long-term complications, improve breathing, and offer peace of mind. Instead of waiting for it to fade, act early and protect your health.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both prebiotics and probiotics support a happier, healthier gut. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re wondering which is better, prebiotics help promote longer-term gut health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can get prebiotics from oats, garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus and bran cereal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health has officially gone mainstream. Between January 2018 and October 2019 alone, more than 830 articles on the topic were published in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, while many headlines hype the latest &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-you-should-do-everyday-for-better-gut-health-11782347" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-health trends&lt;/a&gt;, few actually break down the science behind them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s where we come in. With gut health in the spotlight, it seems like every supplement brand has a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prebiotic or probiotic product&lt;/a&gt; it claims is essential for your well-being. But what are prebiotics and probiotics—and is one any better for you than the other? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get to the bottom of these questions, we dug into the science to see which of these &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-better-health-according-to-gastroenterologist-8610225" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-health heroes&lt;/a&gt; reigns supreme.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both prebiotics and probiotics are important for gut health, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/postbiotics-8629252" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prebiotics may offer more long-term benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But before we dive into that, it’s helpful to know the differences between the two. Probiotics are beneficial live microorganisms that, when consumed in sufficient quantity, provide a health benefit to the host (that’s you). They are usually bacteria, but can also include some types of yeast.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prebiotics, on the flip side, are unique fibers that feed the good bacteria that already reside in your gut. So, basically, prebiotics are the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fuel that keeps your good gut bacteria happy&lt;/a&gt; and healthy.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Both prebiotics and probiotics play an important role in gut health, but I tend to place a greater emphasis on prebiotics,” explains &lt;a href="http://www.rootstorisenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kara Hochreiter, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “While probiotic-rich foods provide beneficial bacteria for the gut microbiome, these microbes are transient, meaning they pass through the digestive tract rather than taking up long-term residence.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Not to mention, supplementing with random probiotics doesn’t do much good unless you know exactly which strains your body actually needs,” she says. “When you eat a diverse, prebiotic-rich diet, you naturally create a healthy and robust ecosystem that makes additional probiotic supplementation less essential.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The interesting thing about prebiotics and probiotics is that they are often studied together. That makes it difficult to tease out whether one is better than the other, since they can work together synergistically. However, research does show that prebiotics have a few pretty stellar advantages. When they reach your gut, they increase the production of beneficial compounds, called short-chain fatty acids. Because SCFAs &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support the gut lining and immune system&lt;/a&gt; and reduce inflammation, they keep your gut healthy over the long haul.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prebiotics also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whole-grains-to-help-you-poop-11800440" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improve stool consistency and regularity&lt;/a&gt;, promoting bowel health. If that weren’t enough, certain types of prebiotics, like the beta-glucan fiber in oats, can also help lower cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prebiotics are foundational because they enhance the health of your existing microbiome,” says gut-health expert &lt;a href="https://poopedia.org/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jessie Wong, M.Acc., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “Almost everyone can benefit from gradually increasing prebiotic-rich foods—especially when combined with regular hydration, stress management and movement.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best way to reap the benefits prebiotics offer is by eating a wide variety of plant foods. However, if you’re looking for the top sources, think garlic, leeks, onions, Jerusalem artichokes, asparagus and bran cereal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics have multiple benefits, such as easing some of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome or providing protection from diarrhea while traveling or after a course of antibiotics. But they aren’t one-size-fits-all. “The benefits of probiotics are strain-specific,” says Wong. “That means one strain might help with bloating, while another helps constipation—and others may do nothing at all or even make symptoms worse. That’s why selecting a probiotic based on marketing usually doesn’t work.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What about other fermented foods, like tempeh and miso? While these may offer some health benefits, they don’t provide enough beneficial live bacteria to technically qualify as probiotics.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prioritizing gut health is key to building and supporting a healthy lifestyle for the long haul. While eating lots of prebiotic- and probiotic-rich foods is a great start, these expert-backed strategies can further promote better gut health.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Wide Variety of Plants: &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-eat-every-week-for-a-healthy-gut-8696826" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diverse, plant-rich eating pattern&lt;/a&gt; helps beneficial gut bugs thrive! Plants are naturally packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gut-healthy fiber&lt;/a&gt;. A good rule of thumb is to aim for 25 to 38 grams of fiber per day from a variety of vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. If you’re new to the fiber train, proceed slowly to reduce bloating, and be sure to drink lots of water to keep things moving. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Down: &lt;/strong&gt;How you eat is equally as important to your gut health as what you’re eating. Take time to sit down and chew thoroughly to allow your body to digest and absorb nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Consistent: &lt;/strong&gt;Just like a toddler, your microbiome loves rhythm and predictability. Focus on a consistent eating schedule, eating meals at regular times each day. If possible, try to avoid late-night eating to support better digestion and promote sounder sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support the Gut-Brain Connection: &lt;/strong&gt;Psychological stress, sleep quality and physical activity can affect the relationship between your gut and your brain. “When you calm your nervous system, you calm your gut,” says Wong. Focus on stress-management techniques that promote a well-rounded, centered you. Consider deep, diaphragmatic breathing to reduce stress and improve digestion. Try gentle movement (like a 10-minute walk) after meals to enhance digestion. And don’t forget those seven to nine hours of nightly sleep for better overall health and mood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While probiotics may seem to reign supreme over prebiotics, gut-health experts suggest this may not be the right hierarchy. Prebiotics feed the beneficial bacteria that already live in your gut, helping to build a more resilient microbiome. And you don’t need a supplement to get your fill. Focusing on prebiotic-rich foods, like oats, garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus and bran cereal, is an easy way to feed your gut the prebiotics it needs to stay in tip-top shape. While you’re at it, don’t forget to add in some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-vs-yogurt-which-is-better-for-gut-health-11797224" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotic-rich yogurt or kefir&lt;/a&gt;. Even though prebiotics may have a slight edge over probiotics, combining the two doubles your chances of gut-health success.&lt;br&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leading theories of memory describe it as being stored in the brain – similarly, some argue, to the way a computer stores memory. But this assumption relies on materialist assumptions and problematically bypasses the hard problem of consciousness. Memory is not stored in space, but in time, argues philosopher &lt;strong&gt;Victoria Trumbull&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From ancient times, philosophers have used the “storage” metaphor to describe the phenomenon of remembering. Memory is often pictured as a vast warehouse or library of experiences. In the past century, this “storage” metaphor has come to be taken literally: neuroscientists today maintain that a “memory” is simply a given pattern or collection of patterns of neural activity. This hypothesis forms a key part of the greater worldview known as “&lt;a href="https://iai.tv/articles/materialism-is-holding-science-back-auid-3364"&gt;materialism&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://iai.tv/articles/why-materialism-is-a-dead-end-bernardo-kastrup-auid-1271"&gt;physicalism&lt;/a&gt;”: in brief, the idea that reality consists solely in physical stuff, and, correspondingly, that the human mind is reducible or equivalent to the body or the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central problem with this picture of memory is that, like many descriptions of the mind, the storage metaphor is only a metaphor. It feels intuitive to say that we “store” memories like books in a library or files on a hard drive. While this is a useful metaphor insofar as it helps us to describe and express &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/articles/memory-creates-reality-and-the-self-auid-3088"&gt;what it feels like to remember&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot be anything more than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that memories are stored in the brain, we would need to be able to &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; this. But this is not a fact that belongs to the order of observation and experimentation. The most that neuroscientists can do is track cerebral activity and attempt to correlate the physical brain state to a description of concurrent mental experience. In carrying out experiments of this kind, however, the neuroscientist has already provisionally assumed that there is an exact identity or perfect equivalence between the mental state and the cerebral state. In other words, the hypothesis of localization that the neuroscientist has set out to prove has already been assumed as an initial axiom of his or her research. The correlation between brain activity and memory reports doesn’t prove that memories are stored in the brain any more than the correlation between footprints and walking proves that walking is stored in footprints, or the correlation between the piano and a sonata proves that the sonata is stored in the piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we assume that the brain stores up discrete, localisable memories, it then becomes extremely difficult to explain &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/articles/our-brains-evolved-to-survive-not-to-find-truth-auid-3406"&gt;how the brain can be said to generate, preserve, and reconstruct “representations” of this kind&lt;/a&gt;. How can the brain translate an image of experience, itself intangible and invisible, into a physical record or neural pattern? The neuroscientist is left with &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/articles/is-your-brain-really-necessary-for-consciousness-auid-3280"&gt;the philosophical challenge famously known as the “hard problem of consciousness”&lt;/a&gt;: given the complex physical machinations of the brain, whence arises the conscious experience of remembering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

We’re told to switch off our phones, meditate, dim the lights, ban &lt;a href="/topic/caffeine"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; after midday and take a magnesium supplement for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while most of us have spent years tinkering with our bedtime routines, the answer might be sitting under our noses. Specifically, on our dinner plates.What you eat, and when you eat it, has just as much impact on your ability to nod off as any blue-light screen or stressful email. Certain foods can raise your &lt;a href="/topic/heart-rate"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, spike your &lt;a href="/topic/temperature"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; or mess with the &lt;a href="/topic/hormones"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; that regulate rest, while others can lull you into slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can’t fall asleep or struggle to stay asleep, &lt;a href="/topic/salt"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; could be the root of the issue,” says Dr Katherine Hall, a sleep psychologist from Somnus Therapy. “Sodium-rich meals result in fluid retention and increased blood pressure, making it hard for the body to switch off completely after eating snacks like crisps or salted nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt doesn’t just make you thirsty. It actually changes the body’s ability to rest. “This then results in something called superficial sleep, where the sleep isn’t very deep and can often involve disturbances like going to the toilet more, as studies show this can be brought on more by too much salt in the &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit, Dr Hall explains, is your blood pressure and fluid balance. A high-sodium meal essentially keeps your body in alert mode. You might fall asleep quickly after that post-pub kebab, but your system won’t fully switch off – which is why you’ll likely wake up groggy, parched and wondering why you feel as though you’ve barely slept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Deborah Lee, from Dr Fox Online Pharmacy, agrees that our digestive systems bear the brunt of late-night indulgence. “When we eat spicy, salty or acidic foods too close to bedtime, our digestive system has to work harder when it should be winding down,” she says. “Spicy foods can raise body temperature and stimulate the release of certain stress hormones, both of which can make it harder to fall asleep. Acidic meals and high salt intake can also trigger heartburn or acid reflux, especially when lying down, which disrupts the natural sleep cycle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about what you eat, but when. “It’s a good idea to leave at least two to three hours between your last meal and going to bed,” adds Dr Lee. “This allows time for digestion and helps prevent reflux. However, it’s not just about the clock: your overall dietary pattern plays a big role too. A diet that’s high in processed, salty or spicy foods can increase inflammation and affect sleep quality over time, even if eaten earlier in the day.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/14/iStock-1344307329.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/14/iStock-1344307329.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/14/iStock-1344307329.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="That late-night curry might hit the spot – but it could be keeping you up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-458468"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;That late-night curry might hit the spot – but it could be keeping you up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to assume that eating light or “clean” before bed will help you sleep, but some of the worst offenders hide behind a halo of health. Tomatoes, soy sauce, aubergines, red wine and cheeses, for instance, are all rich in tyramine, an amino acid that can overstimulate the brain. “Tyramine is an amino acid that is normally a great addition to anyone’s diet as it stimulates natural brain activity,” says Dr Hall. “For those of us looking to get more sleep, however, it’s something to avoid completely if possible. Tyramine stimulates the production of norepinephrine, triggering the ‘fight-or-flight’ response and sending your body into a hyper-aroused state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If salt and acid rev up your blood pressure and digestion, spice messes with something even more primal: your temperature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For anyone struggling to sleep, avoid spicy foods altogether,” says Dr Hall. “Digesting various spices and chillies you have in your curries or other hot dishes can severely disrupt our body’s ability to thermoregulate, which essentially means managing our temperature. Capsaicin is the chemical in spicy &lt;a href="/topic/food"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; that causes our temperature to skyrocket, so combine this with the energy your body needs to digest the remainder of the meal, and you can really struggle getting some solid sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body naturally cools as we approach sleep – it’s part of our circadian rhythm – so raising your core temperature with a fiery curry or hot sauce-laden dinner is like flicking the lights back on just as you’re nodding off. Dr Lee adds that spicy food can also stimulate the release of stress hormones, keeping the body alert when it should be winding down. Combine that with the reflux risk of lying down too soon after eating, and you’ve got a recipe for a restless night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1wzq3bw-0 sc-1wzq3bw-3 kqnNdl gGuqvP"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-i07cwn-0 dvtoxw"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7b73b88eb27c89ab" viewbox="0 0 80 47"&gt;&lt;path fill="#eb1426" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic ‘sleepy’ foods like bananas, almonds, milk and chamomile tea all contain or promote compounds such as magnesium, calcium and tryptophan, which can help the body relax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wzq3bw-4 gIguDj"&gt;Dr Deborah Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that while some foods sabotage sleep, others can actively support it. “Meals rich in complex carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fats support the production of melatonin and serotonin: the hormones that regulate sleep and mood,” says Dr Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Classic ‘sleepy’ foods like bananas, almonds, milk and chamomile tea all contain or promote compounds such as magnesium, calcium and tryptophan, which can help the body relax.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the high-sodium, high-spice dinners that raise your heart rate and body temperature, these foods work in harmony with your circadian rhythm. Bananas and almonds are rich in magnesium and potassium – minerals that help relax muscles and calm the nervous system – while milk provides tryptophan, the amino acid used to produce serotonin and melatonin. Chamomile tea contains apigenin, a natural compound that binds to brain receptors to encourage drowsiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Lee says magnesium, in particular, is one of the most important nutrients for rest. “It supports relaxation and helps regulate the body’s stress response,” she explains. “Tryptophan and vitamin B6 are also key players, as they’re needed to make serotonin and melatonin. Zinc and calcium play supportive roles too: they’re involved in neurotransmitter function and help the brain transition into deeper sleep stages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been flirting with magnesium supplements or fancy teas, you could just start with your diet. Think leafy greens, nuts, seeds and whole grains. These foods don’t just set you up for better rest at night – they also help regulate energy and mood throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we often think of sleep as something that happens at night, Dr Lee emphasises that the groundwork is laid long before bedtime. “When blood sugar levels fluctuate too much throughout the day, it can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep,” she says. “Spikes and crashes can trigger cortisol, a stress hormone that keeps us alert. Balanced meals that combine protein, fibre and healthy fats help maintain steady energy levels, which sets the stage for more useful sleep later.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/40/iStock-696544568.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/40/iStock-696544568.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/03/12/40/iStock-696544568.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A humble banana before bed?

Science says it might just help you sleep&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut health plays a role, too. “The gut and brain are in constant communication through the vagus nerve, and a healthy gut microbiome supports the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin,” says Dr Lee. “Poor gut health, from stress, poor diet or lack of fibre, can interfere with this process and lead to disrupted sleep. A diet rich in prebiotic fibre, fermented foods and diverse plant foods supports both gut and sleep health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re genuinely hungry before bed, don’t panic – the goal isn’t to go to sleep starving. “A small, balanced snack can be helpful,” says Dr Lee. “Try something light like Greek yoghurt with berries, a banana with a spoon of nut butter or wholegrain toast with hummus. These options provide slow-release carbohydrates and a bit of protein to keep blood sugar steady without overloading digestion.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still enjoy dinner out with friends or the occasional spicy meal, but moderation and timing are key. As Dr Lee puts it, “Sleep shouldn’t come at the expense of your social life: the key is balance. If you’re having a late meal or a glass of wine, try to drink plenty of water, eat slowly and finish eating at least two hours before bed. If it’s a particularly heavy or spicy meal, a short walk afterwards can help digestion and reduce reflux risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no single superfood or quick fix that guarantees a perfect night’s rest, but there is a pattern: balance. Heavy, salty or spicy foods overstimulate the body, while those rich in fibre, magnesium and tryptophan soothe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So before you reach for another glass of red or raid the crisp cupboard, remember: your best night’s sleep might not begin in the bedroom, but in the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPaTEzMUtLX05JTDNiZDZmWG5YU3Z5ZExlcEE5ZlE0dFRwR29haW1JX1c0cjlJR2JITWFmRUhUOW9Qd1N2RVhkTjhuRWE2SktwQkVzYmdTWlRVdDNDQWFoTFY4My0yQ2dKZEh6US15Sm9SSXJBTzQ3d1RmZ2dienlzdUUtdk5vNWhGTlNRc2RxSVVIdUNhQkZaRHAwWFRaY0ZkMlJNVVg2cmhvaTAtZVpTdDN4eDFUdw</guid></item><item><title>一种常见的糖尿病药物与女性的“卓越长寿”有关- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Not only can the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; help to effectively manage type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="181787" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, but it may also give older women a better chance of living to the grand old age of 90, according to recent research – thanks, it seems, to a variety of anti-aging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in the US and Germany used data from a long-term US study of postmenopausal women. Records on a total of 438 people were picked out – half of whom took metformin to treat diabetes, and half who took a different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-experimental-drug-breaks-record-for-weight-loss-in-clinical-trials"&gt;diabetes drug&lt;/a&gt;, called sulfonylurea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are some caveats and asterisks to the study, those in the metformin group were calculated to have a 30 percent lower risk of dying before the age of 90 than those in the sulfonylurea group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/after-60-years-diabetes-drug-found-to-unexpectedly-impact-the-brain"&gt;After 60 Years, Diabetes Drug Found to Unexpectedly Impact The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metformin has been shown to target multiple pathways of aging and therefore has been postulated as a drug that may extend human longevity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that metformin initiation increased exceptional longevity compared with sulfonylurea initiation among women with type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-will-be-trialled-as-an-anti-ageing-elixir-from-next-year"&gt;around for decades&lt;/a&gt; and is considered a gerotherapeutic: a drug able to slow down various aging processes in the body.

However, scientists aren't yet sure that the drug extends lifespan, especially in humans – which is part of the reason for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research can't prove cause and effect like a randomized controlled trial (RCT) might be able to, because the participants weren't randomly assigned to one treatment or the other – rather, they were following professional advice. What's more, there wasn't a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, given no treatment. The overall sample size wasn't particularly large, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also has its strengths – for example, the average follow-up period was 14 to 15 years, extending far beyond the length a standard RCT would be able to. That's important to understand how any intervention impacts lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A key advantage of our analysis was the long follow-up period after treatment initiation enabled by examination of a cohort with extensive follow-up from midlife to ages 90 and older, which is not feasible in typical randomized controlled trials," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-simple-habits-are-key-to-slowing-aging-experts-reveal"&gt;These Five Simple Habits Are Key to Slowing Aging, Experts Reveal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCTs could follow further down the line to dig deeper into these results, the researchers suggest.

    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Many women use exercise, diet changes and supplements for menopause symptoms, but a new study suggests self-pleasure may belong in that toolkit too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Researchers at the Kinsey Institute surveyed peri- and postmenopausal women and found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002675" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;masturbation was among the highest-rated symptom-management methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Self-pleasure matters in menopause care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Surveys show that almost 90% of medical trainees &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512222001803" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel unprepared to support patients through menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;, and many women say they receive little information from their healthcare providers. Although menopause has had a rise in media coverage, research and clinical training still lag behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Menopause is important to research for many reasons, one of which is that most women going through perimenopause experience several symptoms that have been described by women as ‘highly disruptive and intolerable,’” said the authors of the latest study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;These symptoms range from sleep problems and mood changes to vaginal dryness and pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Hormone therapy can be effective, but its use has dropped, with only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378512224000926" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;~4% of women in the United States currently prescribed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; it. Concerns dating back to the early 2000s, along with side effects, continue to influence decisions. As a result, many women turn to lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Research outside of menopause has shown that masturbation and orgasm can support sleep, improve mood, reduce pain and increase genital blood flow. One study found that regular masturbation was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/386220" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;linked to lower levels of vaginal atrophy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; in postmenopausal women. Even so, no previous work has directly tested self-pleasure as a menopause symptom-relief tool, and medical conversations rarely include it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Conversations about menopause often focus on hormone therapy or lifestyle changes, but self-pleasure remains overlooked,” said co-author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://genderstudies.indiana.edu/about/faculty/graham-cynthia.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Cynthia Graham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;, a distinguished professor in gender studies at Indiana University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Graham and the team set out to learn how often women use masturbation to manage symptoms, how effective they believe it is compared with other approaches and how willing they might be to try it if a clinician suggested it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Masturbation and menopause symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The researchers ran an online survey designed to reflect the demographics of women aged 40–65 years across the US. Participants completed questions about menopause symptoms, self-pleasure, sexual history and other symptom-management strategies. Only women who were peri- or postmenopausal were included in the final analysis, resulting in a sample of 1,178 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The survey asked about 15 symptom-management strategies, including masturbation, and participants rated how helpful each approach was on a 5-point scale. They also reported which of 19 symptoms improved after masturbation. A set of questions explored doctor–patient conversations about menopause and sexual health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The team found that masturbation is not widely used as a symptom-management tool. Around 13.5% of perimenopausal women and 9.7% of postmenopausal women said they used it for symptom relief; however, 19.5% of the overall sample had never masturbated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Perimenopausal participants gave self-pleasure an average score of 4.35 out of 5, which was similar to partnered sex, sex toy use and hormone therapy, and higher than many lifestyle changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;When asked about specific symptoms, almost half of the perimenopausal women and one-third of postmenopausal women reported improvements in at least one symptom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Perimenopausal women most often cited improvements in mood swings, falling asleep and irritability, and postmenopausal women pointed to sleep problems and mood shifts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Smaller groups reported benefits for lubrication, pain, desire and headaches, and only 2.7% reported worsening symptoms, often linked to poor health or difficulty reaching orgasm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Despite only 7% of perimenopausal and 4% of postmenopausal women having ever discussed masturbation with a clinician, many said they would try it if they knew it could help – and more than half would do so if a clinician recommended it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Many women use exercise, diet changes and supplements for menopause symptoms, but a new study suggests self-pleasure may belong in that toolkit too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Researchers at the Kinsey Institute surveyed peri- and postmenopausal women and found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002675" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;masturbation was among the highest-rated symptom-management methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Self-pleasure matters in menopause care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Surveys show that almost 90% of medical trainees &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512222001803" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel unprepared to support patients through menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;, and many women say they receive little information from their healthcare providers. Although menopause has had a rise in media coverage, research and clinical training still lag behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Menopause is important to research for many reasons, one of which is that most women going through perimenopause experience several symptoms that have been described by women as ‘highly disruptive and intolerable,’” said the authors of the latest study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;These symptoms range from sleep problems and mood changes to vaginal dryness and pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Hormone therapy can be effective, but its use has dropped, with only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378512224000926" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;~4% of women in the United States currently prescribed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; it. Concerns dating back to the early 2000s, along with side effects, continue to influence decisions. As a result, many women turn to lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Research outside of menopause has shown that masturbation and orgasm can support sleep, improve mood, reduce pain and increase genital blood flow. One study found that regular masturbation was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/386220" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;linked to lower levels of vaginal atrophy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; in postmenopausal women. Even so, no previous work has directly tested self-pleasure as a menopause symptom-relief tool, and medical conversations rarely include it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;“Conversations about menopause often focus on hormone therapy or lifestyle changes, but self-pleasure remains overlooked,” said co-author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;a href="https://genderstudies.indiana.edu/about/faculty/graham-cynthia.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Cynthia Graham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;, a distinguished professor in gender studies at Indiana University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Graham and the team set out to learn how often women use masturbation to manage symptoms, how effective they believe it is compared with other approaches and how willing they might be to try it if a clinician suggested it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;Masturbation and menopause symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The researchers ran an online survey designed to reflect the demographics of women aged 40–65 years across the US. Participants completed questions about menopause symptoms, self-pleasure, sexual history and other symptom-management strategies. Only women who were peri- or postmenopausal were included in the final analysis, resulting in a sample of 1,178 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;The survey asked about 15 symptom-management strategies, including masturbation, and participants rated how helpful each approach was on a 5-point scale. They also reported which of 19 symptoms improved after masturbation. A set of questions explored doctor–patient conversations about menopause and sexual health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A street lamp outside your window, the orange charging light on a plug adapter next to your nightstand, a flash of your phone late at night indicating you’ve received an email—these artificial light sources would never occur in nature, and recent studies suggest they harm your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of artificial light at night were linked to increased stress-related activity in the brain, inflamed arteries, and a higher risk of heart disease, according to a preliminary study presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial light at night, or nighttime light pollution, is a nearly universal feature of modern cities, according to the study. This first-of-its-kind study reviewed brain scans and satellite images to show a biological pathway linking nighttime light exposure to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that environmental factors, such as air and noise pollution, can lead to heart disease by affecting our nerves and blood vessels through stress. Light pollution is very common; however, we don’t know much about how it affects the heart,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; study senior author Shady Abohashem, head of cardiac PET/CT imaging trials at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;450 adult patients underwent identical PET/CT scans, and all of whom were without heart disease and no active cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a routine imaging test at my hospital,” Abohashem said. “The CT portion provides detailed anatomy, while the PET portion reveals metabolic activity in tissues. Using both imaging techniques together allows for the measurement of brain stress activity and arterial inflammation in a single scan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that people exposed to higher levels of artificial light at night had higher brain stress activity, blood vessel inflammation and a higher risk of major heart events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information was collected from medical records and evaluated by two cardiologists who were blinded, meaning they were unaware of any information that could influence their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater the artificial night light exposure, the higher the risk of heart disease development. Every standard deviation increase in light exposure was associated with about 35% and 22% increased risk of heart disease over five- and 10-year follow-up periods, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These associations remained after accounting for traditional risk factors and other socio-environmental exposures like noise pollution and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, these heart risks were higher among participants who lived in areas with additional social or environmental stress, such as high traffic noise or lower neighborhood income. Over a 10-year follow-up period, 17% of participants had major heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIOHACKING STOIRES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Device from MIT Startup Helps People Fall Asleep–Putting Your Mind on ‘Do Not Disturb’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/device-from-mit-startup-helps-people-fall-asleep-putting-your-brain-on-do-not-disturb/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Device from MIT Startup Helps People Fall Asleep–Putting Your Mind on ‘Do Not Disturb’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found a nearly linear relationship between nighttime light and heart disease: the more night-light exposure, the higher the risk. Even modest increases in night-time light were linked with higher brain and artery stress,” Abohashem said. “When the brain perceives stress, it activates signals that can trigger an immune response and inflame the blood vessels. Over time, this process can contribute to hardening of the arteries and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to counter the effects of artificial light at night, he suggested that cities could reduce unnecessary outdoor lighting, shield streetlamps or use motion-sensitive lights. On a personal level, “people can limit indoor nighttime light, keeping bedrooms dark and avoiding screens such as TVs and personal electronic devices before bed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RETURN TO NATURE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="A Daycare Rewilded its Yard and the Children Became Healthier: Now the Whole Nation Is Doing it" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/a-daycare-rewilded-its-yard-and-the-children-became-healthier-now-the-whole-nation-is-doing-it/" rel="bookmark"&gt;A Daycare Rewilded its Yard and the Children Became Healthier: Now the Whole Nation Is Doing it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings are novel and add to the evidence suggesting that reducing exposure to excessive artificial light at night is a public health concern,” said Julio Fernandez-Mendoza, director of behavioral sleep medicine at Pennsylvania State University, Hershey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study had several strengths, including using state-of-the-art PET/CT imaging to measure brain stress and artery inflammation, combined with satellite light data and long-term follow-up for heart events. The CT/PET scans allowed them to see the inflammation coalesce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SURVIVING MODERNITY: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Merely Watching Scenes of Nature Can Reduce Pain, Says New Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/merely-watching-scenes-of-nature-can-reduce-pain-says-new-study/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Merely Watching Scenes of Nature Can Reduce Pain, Says New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the study also has several limitations. Importantly, it is an observational study, an analysis of previously collected information; therefore, it cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between any of the variables reviewed. Second, the study included participants who received health care at only one hospital system, which means the participant group may not represent a diverse group of people, and the findings cannot be generalized to represent a larger population group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know too much exposure to artificial light at night can harm your health, particularly increasing the risk of heart disease. However, we did not know how this harm happened,” Fernandez-Mendoza said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in her 60s, Ford had been diagnosed with lupus years earlier. It’s a mysterious autoimmune disease that drives inflammation as the body’s own immune system fights tissue and organs instead of foreign intruders like viruses and bacteria. Symptoms are a rollercoaster, from hair loss to joint pain that afflicted Ford so badly that she had to quit the job she loved. Strange rashes also broke out on her legs — then quickly disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 1.5 million Americans have lupus and almost all — 90% — are women  There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms, but the troubling side effects can include osteoporosis and eye damage. More rarely, lupus can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a fun disease&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; at all,” said Ford, now 77, who lives in the northern Solano County city of Dixon. “You never know when it’s going to exacerbate. And for no reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-94amudz6" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_94amudz6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause of lupus has eluded medical researchers for decades. But this week a team of Stanford Medicine researchers claim they’ve cracked the code, a development some independent lupus experts described as a “major breakthrough” that could lay the groundwork for a potential cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/24/stanford-ucsf-launch-cancer-research-and-care-collaboration/"&gt;Stanford, UCSF launch cancer research and care collaboration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210"&gt;In a paper&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine, the Stanford researchers said they have connected the dots between lupus and the Epstein-Barr virus, a virus 95% of Americans carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, that common virus infects certain white blood cells that are part of the immune system until, ultimately, more and more cells are recruited into a battle against the command centers of cells in one’s own body.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Betty Tsao, a prolific autoimmune disease researcher and professor of medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, said other biological factors may complicate the race to cure lupus. But she described the Stanford research team’s paper as “a major breakthrough” and said the study is “convincing” in illustrating the biology behind lupus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an exciting time,” Tsao said. “And we hope we will have much better therapy options for patients in a very short horizon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Robinson, professor of immunology and rheumatology at the Stanford medical school, who is the study’s senior author, said the “breakthrough” reveals “the key missing link for how EBV causes lupus,” using the acronym for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery may reveal new possibilities for effective prevention and treatment. Currently, doctors offer lupus patients a wide range of medications with limited results and a slew of possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;By identifying the biological process that leads to lupus, Robinson said he and his colleagues can pursue treatment to interrupt the immune system’s misguided — and dangerous — attack against the body it is designed to protect. In particular, the co-authors plan to use a targeted sequencing technology to identify and remove the white blood cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would “effectively cure lupus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s now the mission of EBVio Inc., a privately-held biotech company co-founded by Robinson and two of his Stanford colleagues. On Wednesday, Robinson said they did not have immediate plans to take the company public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make a good drug,” Robinson said. “We’re still pretty early-stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study landed as other scientists advance early research into &lt;a href="https://www.lupus.org/resources/car-t-cell-therapy-for-lupus"&gt;the application of a cancer treatment to lupus patients.&lt;/a&gt; In that approach, CAR T-cell therapy, white blood cells called B cells are removed en masse from the body. That could put lupus into remission, but at the cost of a weakened immune system, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area and Northern California, the new research was greeted with gratitude and praise in the community of people living with lupus, or those supporting a family member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By tying lupus to the Epstein-Barr virus, the Stanford paper “represents a transformative moment for millions of people living with this devastating disease,” said Thomas Bakewell, executive director of the Lupus Foundation of Northern California. “This finding brings us closer than ever to understanding the ‘why’ behind lupus and, importantly, opens the door to new pathways for prevention and cure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of a cure for lupus would “truly be amazing,” said Shauntay Davis-Patterson, 48. The Sacramento parent of two adopted boys knows all too well the journey of living with lupus, over the course of 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis-Patterson has contended with joint paint so severe that she couldn’t walk, hair loss, hospitalizations and bouts with chemotherapy. Lupus has attacked her kidneys so viciously that she’s waiting for a transplant. On top of that, she’s endured the “toxic” side effects of medication intended to help her. Prednisone, a steroid, improved her symptoms, but at the cost of osteoporosis, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all kind of suffer in silence a lot because people don’t understand what we go through,” said Davis-Patterson, who runs a support group for lupus patients as part of the lupus foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford also developed osteoporosis, a brittleness and weakness in bones, because of Prednisone. And Plaquenil, which eases pain and swelling, can cause eye damage in patients who are older or have taken the drug for many years. Every six months, Ford has a doctor examine the health of her retinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, big picture, both women consider themselves blessed. Davis-Patterson said she is grateful she can run after her boys, and that she was diagnosed quickly all those years ago. Some have to navigate the health system for years to nail down a diagnosis, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ford is grateful that she’s as healthy as she is — even after two hip replacements. On Thursday, she laughed and brushed off talk of her symptoms and the pile of pills she has to take every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really not that bad,” she said. “I think I’m one of the lucky ones, actually.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, scientists and physicians increasingly reported a little-known health threat: peanut allergies. Estimates from the time suggest that only 0.4% of children had a peanut allergy. But the tide, it seemed, was changing — and changing fast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Canadian doctors published what is likely the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/more-people-are-experiencing-severe-food-allergies-than-ever-before-108124"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1268069/"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, recounting how a 24-year-old woman with a known nut allergy died moments after biting into a piece of cake topped with hazelnut icing. Hundreds more studies followed, documenting not only a rise in peanut allergies but an increasing number of people with allergies so severe that they resulted in death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans took notice. Newspapers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3700803/#R13"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; alarming stories: “Peanut Allergies Have Put Sufferers on Constant Alert,” read one 1995 Wall Street Journal headline; “Nut Allergy Girl’s Terror; Girl Almost Dies from Peanut Allergy,” reported the Daily Mirror.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that by 1997, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db121.htm"&gt;3.4%&lt;/a&gt; of children were allergic to at least one food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to these rising allergy rates, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/106/2/346/62820/Hypoallergenic-Infant-Formulas?token=2a7afc11-81ed-4ac4-9e02-bd0adfa7e1b8"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommending that parents avoid exposing infants to common food allergens until at least one year of age, and that nursing mothers also avoid consuming those foods. The guidelines’ authors acknowledged a lack of scientific evidence underlying their recommendations, including the push to delay introducing nuts until children were 3 years old. But the guidelines, they wrote, seemed “reasonable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, this guidance was “gospel” among pediatricians and parents, according to medical experts who spoke with Straight Arrow News. However, skeptical scientists later disproved these recommendations, prompting the AAP to retract its guidelines in 2008 and reverse them in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By then, an untold number of parents had withheld peanuts and other allergenic foods from their kids, increasing the risk of food allergies. Outside of its policy reversal, however, the AAP offered little public acknowledgment of how its earlier recommendations may have contributed to the rise in peanut allergies. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/opinion/medicine-allergies-research.html"&gt;debacle&lt;/a&gt; went down in the record as another misstep, fueling the public’s waning trust in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-toll-of-food-allergies"&gt;The toll of food allergies&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) estimates that today&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/food-allergy#:~:text=NIAID%20is%20the%20lead%20institute,severe%20and%20life%2Dthreatening%20response."&gt;8%&lt;/a&gt; of children and 11% of adults — some &lt;a href="https://www.foodallergy.org/resources/facts-and-statistics"&gt;33 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans — have at least one food allergy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For some, a food allergy is a minor inconvenience; for others, it is a life-threatening condition. &lt;a href="https://www.jenniferprotudjer.ca/our-team.html"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Protudjer&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba, has spent years studying the effects of food allergies on individuals and communities. She and her team estimated that individuals with allergies and their families spend up to $1,700 more on allergy-friendly foods per year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent study estimated that food allergies cost &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/13696998.2025.2563462?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#d1e347"&gt;$22,234&lt;/a&gt; per patient per year, totaling $370 billion annually, when considering direct medical costs, household out-of-pocket expenses for specialty foods and broader societal costs such as lost work or reduced household productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another study found that the odds of being food insecure were 39% greater among families whose kids have food allergies, compared to those without them, Protudjer told Straight Arrow News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with food allergies and their caregivers even have a poorer quality of life, studies have found, and may suffer from food allergy anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We think that burden stems from the persistent threat of exposure to a food to which children might be allergic, but it also stems from the fact that the management of food allergy typically requires avoidance of the food in most or all forms,” Protudjer said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guideline-reversal-nbsp"&gt;Guideline reversal &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the AAP released its guidelines, the number of children with a peanut allergy continued to rise; rates more than &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2010/rate-of-childhood-peanut-allergies-more-than-tripled-between-1997-and-2008"&gt;tripled&lt;/a&gt; from 1997 to 2008. In January of that year, the AAP &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/121/1/183/71045?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Pediatrics_TrendMD_0"&gt;revised&lt;/a&gt; its position, noting that current evidence did not support withholding allergenic foods from infants or nursing moms. But the new guidance stopped short of instructing parents to feed their infants these foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-520101" srcset="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg 1920w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=300,106 300w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=768,272 768w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=1024,363 1024w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-02.jpg?resize=1536,544 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later in 2008, British researchers published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19000582/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found the prevalence of peanut allergies among Israeli children — who commonly ate products containing peanuts from a young age — was 0.17% while the rate among U.K. children was 1.85%. The study led by &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/gideon-lack"&gt;Gideon Lack&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at King’s College London, presented landmark evidence debunking the guidance to avoid peanuts and other allergens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Lack led another critical study in which researchers randomly assigned 640 infants to either avoid or consume peanuts for the first five years of life. Researchers selected infants who either had egg allergy, severe eczema or both — conditions that predisposed the babies to develop a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, 13.7% of the children who avoided peanuts developed a peanut allergy, compared with 1.9% of children who ate peanuts. Researchers concluded that introducing infants to peanuts and other allergenic foods prevented allergies, contradicting the AAP’s earliest guidance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2017, NIAID formally published new &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5226648/"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; instructing parents to introduce peanut-containing foods around six months of age. For higher-risk infants, such as those with eczema or egg allergy, parents were instructed to introduce foods containing peanuts even earlier, starting at four months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of children who developed food allergies dropped sharply, from 1.46% of children studied before the new guidelines to 0.93% after, a recent &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/5/e2024070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found. That translates to almost 60,000 fewer children developing a food allergy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-520100" srcset="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg 1920w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=128,72 128w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=288,162 288w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=480,270 480w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325-GFX-SANOG_Peanut-Allergies-03.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rate of kids developing a peanut allergy, specifically, fell by 46%. The shift was so significant that eggs overtook peanuts as the most common allergen among children. The study contributed to a growing body of evidence suggesting that withholding certain foods from infants may spur, rather than prevent, food allergies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lack-of-accountability-and-erosion-of-public-trust"&gt;Lack of accountability and erosion of public trust&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trust in science is waning. Fewer than 60% of Americans believe science has a mostly positive effect on society, and only 73% are confident that scientists act in the public’s best interests, according to a Pew Research Center &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12478942/#:~:text=Overall%20change%20in%20trust%20in,(Cohen's%20d%20=%200.02)."&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a major inflection point. However, the reversal of earlier guidance on peanut allergies has also highlighted how shifting advice and a lack of accountability can erode public trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some have criticized the AAP for releasing guidelines based on “consensus statements and groupthink rather than evidence‐based medicine,” as one medical ethics researcher &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11976139/#apa70022-bib-0001"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hindsight is always 20-20, and I agree a lot of times we make guidelines based on very little data. And that’s what happened in 2000,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=17229"&gt;Ruchi Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics and the director of the Center for Food Allergy &amp;amp; Asthma Research at Northwestern University, told Straight Arrow News. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think there was just a lot of fear, because we started getting these headlines in the news of people dying from peanut exposure. And so, you know, I hate to blame anyone, but we really just didn’t know,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gupta stressed that the guidelines were developed at a time of uncertainty and had no malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everybody’s doing their best. I don’t think anyone’s trying to put something out there that, you know, may not be correct or may do harm,” she said. “And that’s our first thing: Do no harm. So, like with the peanut thing, once we saw a rise, I think the instinct of every pediatrician is do no harm, protect our babies, you know. And so that was an easy way to potentially do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine major allergens — milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans and sesame — &lt;mark class="has-inline-color"&gt;account for 90% of food allergies&lt;/mark&gt; in the U.S., according to the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2025/11/03/peanut-allergy-public-health-study"&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt;, including a representative from the AAP who spoke with Straight Arrow News, noted that those original guidelines were more of a sidenote embedded in a report about hypoallergenic infant formulas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There wasn’t really a huge focus on peanuts, but there was a comment in the report that, based on some hypothesis-generating types of data from what was available at the time, that for kids with high-risk developing food allergy, that they might benefit from delayed introduction,” Dr. Drew Bird, chair of the AAP’s’ Section on Allergy and Immunology, told Straight Arrow News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know that I necessarily call that a huge endorsement by the AAP to change the way kids are fed. But regardless, that is how it evolved. It seems that that became a bit of the gospel that was communicated to pediatricians or that was interpreted. And over time, it became kind of widespread that parents should delay introduction of allergenic solids, including peanuts, until they were older,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors of the original guidelines do head off their recommendations with the following statement: “Conclusive studies are not yet available to permit definitive recommendations. However, the following recommendations seem reasonable at this time…” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci, who served as the director of NIAID from 1984 to 2022, characterized the AAP’s guidelines as a “wrong call.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t make the recommendation,” Fauci &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DQChRMVjkwQ/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS in 2019. “I wouldn’t say it was an error. I think what it was, it was a judgment call, that in the retrospect was the wrong call.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gupta pointed out that the AAP still maintains current recommendations around infant feeding that are not supported by scientific evidence. She pointed to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/patiented/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/ppe_schmitt_222/82460/Solid-Foods-for-Infants-Baby-Foods?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; that instructs parents to introduce infants to foods &lt;a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/news-stories/experts-question-need-to-wait-days-between-introducing-new-solid-foods-to-infants/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; at a time every three to five days.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“Why are we saying that when there’s still no data around that?” she asked. “You’re reducing the diversity in their diet at that really critical age, that early age where their immune systems are developing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gupta and her colleagues are working to change these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think a lot of our guidelines make no sense, you know, and don’t have any data behind it,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-do-we-know-now-about-the-causes-of-food-allergies"&gt;What do we know now about the causes of food allergies?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists still do not fully understand food allergies or their risk factors. Some studies have linked the higher risks of food allergies to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36733768/"&gt;C-section&lt;/a&gt; deliveries and increased &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(19)31037-1/fulltext"&gt;antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; during early childhood. Other scientists have found that breastfeeding may lower infants’ risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many aspects of modern life likely factor in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the sun exposure we are not getting, it’s the foods we are not eating and the foods we are eating, it’s the chemicals we are exposed to, it’s the pollutants in our air, it’s the stress in our lives,” said &lt;a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/doctors/waheeda-samady-3250/"&gt;Waheeda Samady&lt;/a&gt;, a physician, professor and the codirector of clinical research at Northwestern University’s Center for Food Allergy and Asthma Research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is all of it combined that is probably causing our bodies to be dysregulated and cause these allergic processes,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while introducing infants to allergenic foods as soon as they are able to eat solids has been shown to reduce overall rates of food allergy, it does not guarantee prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists are starting to gain some clarity around how food allergies develop. One leading theory centers around how infants are first exposed to a potential allergen. Infants who are first exposed through their skin — for instance, a mother eats peanuts before touching her infant and some peanut oil residue transfers onto the baby’s skin — are more likely to develop an allergy than those who are exposed through ingesting peanut butter, Samady said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When an infant is first introduced to an allergen through their gut, they build tolerance rather than develop an allergy, Samady explained. This may be why feeding infants foods as early as possible is key: It allows exposure through their gut rather than their skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-should-parents-handle-allergens"&gt;How should parents handle allergens?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the average child, Samady instructs parents to start feeding their infant as soon as they are ready to eat, meaning they can sit up, hold their head up, and show an interest in food. Once an infant is ready to eat, parents should offer them a variety of foods as long as they are safe and do not present a choking hazard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re concerned about food allergies, then all the more reason to give them and to give them often. Don’t avoid any food, certainly not peanut butter, egg and milk. There’s now evidence that all three of those foods, if given early, you can avoid food allergies,” she told Straight Arrow News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists also recommend giving allergenic foods more often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You want to avoid what I call the ‘one and done,’ which is like, ‘We gave him peanut butter at 5-and-a-half months. He really liked it. It was good, and then we never gave it again,’” Samady said. “That is not enough to prevent food allergies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Straight Arrow News</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNWGZtTTFkWUJoMWxLOXJRSEZuYkgzazRvajVCWlM0b3lJZlZQU05XTm5lSVFwMER1cWtyR1RDZzZ0SGRWQWtiMzRVNEVsVEUwTmNMM3VXX0x6SmYzN29tWi1XSlF1dG95Z3QtX05Hei1iQXR3X2ktdks3WFN3ZV95d1NUY3lNR201VEgtTDVETVRzVWtIVGh6MmhqaUlQNDVFc0dFaHhDb3M4dWdYSG1LTmI4Y1ZXejVieEZwZVVn</guid></item><item><title>吃土豆如何帮助保护您的心脏并降低疾病风险-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/how-eating-potatoes-may-help-protect-your-heart-and-lower-disease-risk/articleshow/125382984.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes rarely make it into conversations about healthy food, mostly because people picture chips, creamy mash or buttery roasted trays at Sunday lunch. Yet the potato itself, before it is drowned in oil or salt, is far more nutritious than many realise. Researchers have been taking a closer look at what this simple root actually offers, and the findings are surprisingly positive. A peer-reviewed study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38763265/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; followed thousands of adults over time and found that people who ate more potatoes had a slightly lower risk of cardiovascular disease and early death. It suggests that the humble potato, when cooked sensibly, might play a small but helpful role in long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;keyword id="24704376" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="health-benefits-of-potatoes" source="keywords"&gt;health benefits of potatoes&lt;/keyword&gt; for long-term heart protection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people associate heart-healthy foods with obvious choices like leafy greens, berries and oats. Potatoes rarely appear on that list, yet they contain nutrients that directly support cardiovascular function. They are naturally high in potassium, a mineral that helps regulate blood pressure by counteracting the effects of sodium. Their fibre content also contributes to smoother digestion and better cholesterol control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers who examined dietary data noticed that people who regularly ate potatoes in cooked, non-fried forms often had slightly healthier heart profiles. This does not make potatoes a miracle cure, but it shows that they can fit comfortably into a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the health benefits of potatoes come from their nutrient-rich profile&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes contain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vitamin-c" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, vitamin B6, magnesium, antioxidants and resistant starch. Each of these plays a different part in keeping the body functioning smoothly. Vitamin C helps protect cells from oxidative stress. B6 contributes to nervous system health and supports metabolism. Resistant starch, which forms when potatoes cool down after cooking, behaves like a prebiotic. It feeds beneficial gut bacteria and improves overall gut balance, which researchers increasingly connect to immune strength, reduced inflammation and chronic disease prevention. When you stop viewing potatoes as empty carbs and start seeing their full nutritional picture, they become far more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What research says about the health benefits of potatoes for cancer prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some early studies suggest that potato compounds, particularly antioxidants like chlorogenic acid and certain plant chemicals found in coloured potato varieties, may help reduce cellular damage linked with cancer. However, most of these findings come from laboratory research rather than large human studies. Scientists are cautious about drawing strong conclusions, but they agree that including antioxidant-rich foods in the diet supports long-term cell protection. Potatoes can contribute to that mix, especially when eaten alongside vegetables, legumes and whole grains. The important message is balance. Potatoes can play a supportive role, but they should not be seen as a standalone defence against disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why preparation affects the health benefits of potatoes more than people realise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the negative assumptions about potatoes come from how they are prepared rather than the potato itself. Frying them in oil, covering them in cheese or pairing them with heavy, salty toppings alters their nutritional value dramatically. Steaming, baking, boiling or roasting with minimal oil keeps their natural nutrients intact. Leaving the skin on boosts fibre and mineral content. Even something as simple as letting cooked potatoes cool before eating increases resistant starch levels. The cooking method determines whether potatoes support health or work against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the health benefits of potatoes support blood sugar balance and weight control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often worry that potatoes raise blood sugar too quickly, but the body’s response depends heavily on how they are cooked, the portion size and what they are eaten with. When paired with protein, vegetables or healthy fats, the rise in blood sugar is steadier and more controlled. Fibre and resistant starch slow digestion and improve fullness, which can support healthier eating patterns and weight balance. These effects contribute indirectly to better heart and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simple ways to maximise the health benefits of potatoes in everyday meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small changes can make potatoes a healthier part of daily meals. Choose baked, roasted or boiled potatoes instead of fried ones. Enjoy them with herbs, olive oil, lemon or yoghurt instead of heavy cream or butter. Pair them with vegetables and lean proteins for balanced meals. Cold potato salads made with light dressings provide extra resistant starch. Eating the skin, when washed properly, ensures you get more fibre, potassium and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes will never replace leafy greens or pulses, but they do not need to. Their strength lies in being accessible, versatile and surprisingly nutrient-dense. Current research shows encouraging links between potato consumption and heart health, and early evidence suggests there may also be benefits for cancer prevention. Prepared sensibly, potatoes can be a valuable part of a balanced diet. The next time you add potatoes to your plate, remember they are far more than just a side dish. They can actively support your long-term wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

They are all solid core exercises, but working on the ground can feel less inviting as you get older. Maybe your knees don’t appreciate getting down and back up, or you find it uncomfortable pressing against the floor, even with one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-yoga-mats" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-yoga-mats"&gt;best yoga mats&lt;/a&gt;.

This day of action builds on powerful momentum, with countries and partners uniting to launch ambitious vaccination campaigns, expand screening and treatment services, and accelerate progress toward eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual commemoration highlights a critical opportunity: cervical cancer – the fourth most common cancer in women – claims over 350 000 lives each year, yet it is a disease that we have the tools to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Day supports the core pillars of the WHO’s global elimination strategy: vaccinating 90% of girls against human papillomavirus (HPV), screening 70% of women, and treating 90% of those with pre-cancer and invasive cancer. It serves as a critical platform to strengthen advocacy, accelerate service delivery, and mobilize resources to ensure every woman and girl has access to life-saving care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2018, I was proud to launch the global call to action on cervical cancer elimination, and I'm even prouder now to see what was once a distant dream becoming a reality," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "More and more countries are scaling up HPV vaccination, improving screening, and expanding treatment, bringing us closer to a future free of cervical cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This momentum is underscored by the announcement from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and its partners, who estimate that the ambitious goal to reach 86 million girls by the end of 2025 has been met, reflecting a broader wave of country action to advance national elimination plans and expand access to screening and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries are marking World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day with a wave of actions on multiple fronts. Vaccination is scaling up through campaigns in Sierra Leone and Liberia targeting over 1.5 million girls. Screening efforts are also intensifying, with Sierra Leone planning a mass campaign across all 16 districts, followed by an awareness walk. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, advocacy is taking center stage as survivors lead a week-long promotion of self-sampling HPV testing, a key innovation for expanding screening access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past year has seen significant country-level action, providing a powerful foundation for the new annual commemoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Angola: Launched an HPV vaccination campaign in October for girls aged 9–12 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China: Added HPV vaccine into its national immunization programme, scaling up vaccination to all 13-year-old girls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cuba: Launched HPV vaccination in October 2025 for all girls in Grade 4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghana: Held a nationwide vaccination campaign in October 2025 for girls aged 9–14 years, aiming to reach 2.4 million girls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indonesia: Hosted the Second Global Forum for Cervical Cancer Elimination and reaffirmed its commitment to eliminating cervical cancer by 2030 through bold national targets (90-75-90), a strong partnership ecosystem, and substantial investments in vaccination, screening, and treatment under its &lt;a href="https://www.iccp-portal.org/sites/default/files/plans/National%20Cervical%20Cancer%20Elimination%20Plan%20for%20Indonesia%202023-2030_compressed.pdf" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;National Cervical Cancer Elimination Plan 2023–2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nepal: Ran a nationwide HPV vaccination campaign targeting girls aged 10–14 years in February 2025, to mark the introduction of the HPV vaccine in the national immunization schedule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nigeria: Launched a nationwide cervical cancer elimination effort, with the First Lady, Senator Oluremi Tinubu committing US$ 700 000 through the ‘Renewed Hope Initiative’. The investment further affirms Nigeria’s leadership and support for WHO’s elimination targets, reflected also in its co-leadership of the resolution establishing World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pakistan: Launched the national HPV vaccine introduction through a campaign targeting girls aged 9–14, reaching over 9 million girls in what is to date the largest single HPV campaign any country has every conducted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rwanda: Through &lt;em&gt;Mission 2027&lt;/em&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.moh.gov.rw/index.php?eID=dumpFile&amp;amp;t=f&amp;amp;f=117508&amp;amp;token=aa4f520402b85aed5c078c640c13d577f8886467" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Accelerated Plan for Elimination&lt;/a&gt;, the country is rapidly expanding nationwide screening and treatment services to meet the 90-70-90 targets by 2027, three years ahead of the global goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spain: Through the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), Spain’s three-year investment is supporting the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative to strengthen access to HPV vaccination, screening, and treatment in countries of the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;South Africa: Placed cervical cancer elimination on the global stage as part of its G20 health agenda, reaffirming the country’s steadfast support for the WHO Global Strategy. The country also co-led the resolution establishing World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day and is finalizing its National Strategic Framework for Cervical Cancer Elimination, to be launched later this year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tajikistan: Launched HPV vaccination for all girls aged 10–14 years in its routine immunization schedule from October 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tunisia: Introduced the HPV vaccine into its routine immunization programme for 12-year-old girls in April 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Across WHO Western Pacific Region, Unitaid and WHO have expanded their partnership to strengthen cervical cancer prevention and treatment programmes, supporting equitable access to screening and treatment services for precancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries worldwide are accelerating efforts to expand access to HPV vaccination, screening, and treatment, advancing toward the 90-70-90 targets of the Global Strategy.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and its partners, estimate that the ambitious goal to reach 86 million girls by the end of 2025 has been met. The number of girls to be verified based on the official WHO/UNICEF HPV vaccine coverage estimates will be released in July 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That gorilla is the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/how-much-is-health-spending-expected-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.kff.org/health-costs/how-much-is-health-spending-expected-to-grow/" aria-label="$5.6 trillion our nation spends on healthcare"&gt;$5.6 trillion our nation spends on healthcare&lt;/a&gt; each year, a figure that exceeds the total economic output (GDP) of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29" aria-label="every nation except China"&gt;every nation except China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a country, we need to stop counting passes long enough to observe how the gorilla negatively impacts people everywhere: in Washington, in boardrooms, in workplaces and in rural communities. Only then can we confront the gorilla head on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;1. The Gorilla In Washington&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Congress, lawmakers spent more than a month debating how to reopen the government. The fight centered on whether to continue funding the enhanced premium tax credits that have made coverage more affordable for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/aca-credits-health-care-subsidies-government-shutdown-7f7a3609bf78dd7e43be9a041a090220" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://apnews.com/article/aca-credits-health-care-subsidies-government-shutdown-7f7a3609bf78dd7e43be9a041a090220" aria-label="roughly 20 million lower-income Americans"&gt;roughly 20 million lower-income Americans&lt;/a&gt; who purchase coverage through the online health exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats argued that ending those payments in 2026 would cause premiums to spike and make care unaffordable. Republicans warned that continuing them would add nearly $400 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Both believed they were protecting Americans from financial harm. And both were right. If the cost of providing medical care isn’t reduced, neither the federal government nor the average family will be able to afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Peterson Center, the &lt;a href="https://www.pgpf.org/article/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.pgpf.org/article/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries/" aria-label="United States spends $14,885 per person each year on medical care"&gt;United States spends $14,885 per person each year on medical care&lt;/a&gt; while the next highest-paying nation, Switzerland, spends $9,963 per person with far better clinical outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MWrh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. could cut the spending gap between American and Swiss healthcare in half, our nation would save $700 billion annually. Those savings could help maintain ACA subsidies, lower out-of-pocket costs for families and reduce federal deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the gorilla inflicts financial damage far beyond just the ACA exchanges.  Between federal funding cuts and eligibility changes, analysts warn that &lt;a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/insights/our-research/2025/03/how-many-expansion-adults-could-lose-medicaid-under-federal-work-requirements.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.rwjf.org/en/insights/our-research/2025/03/how-many-expansion-adults-could-lose-medicaid-under-federal-work-requirements.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" aria-label="millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid"&gt;millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; will become uninsured starting in 2026. Meanwhile, because federal law limits Medicare payment growth to the rate of inflation, hospitals make up lost revenue by charging private insurers and their enrollees more (already about &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1144-2-v2.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1144-2-v2.html" aria-label="250% of Medicare rates"&gt;250% of Medicare rates&lt;/a&gt;). Ultimately, employers and workers will pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;2. The Gorilla In Corporate America &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s C-suite leaders are conducting the business equivalent of counting passes. Instead of confronting the cost of medical care itself, they’re focused on comparing premiums, raising deductibles and choosing plans with narrower physician networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without major changes in how care is delivered, no plan will remain affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/2025-employer-health-benefits-survey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.kff.org/health-costs/2025-employer-health-benefits-survey/" aria-label="average cost of family health coverage"&gt;average cost of family health coverage&lt;/a&gt; will approach $30,000 next year, with employers paying about $24,000 and workers responsible for the rest. A projected 9% premium increase means employers and employees together will spend roughly $2,500 more next year per worker — limiting wage growth, hiring and investments in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America doesn’t have an insurance problem. It has a medical cost crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;3. The Gorilla In The Workplace&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While workers focus on wages, benefits and job security, the same cost crisis threatening businesses and government is about to hit them hard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of U.S. adults receive health insurance through an employer. But as medical costs rise, companies are turning to automation and generative AI to reduce their expenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.eweek.com/news/us-layoffs-2025-ai-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.eweek.com/news/us-layoffs-2025-ai-job-cuts/" aria-label="1 million U.S. jobs have already vanished"&gt;1 million U.S. jobs have already vanished&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 and even more are set to disappear in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon offers a vivid example: the company eliminated 14,000 office and professional roles and announced plans to combine robotics with generative AI to replace as many as three-quarters of its warehouse workforce. New, higher-skill jobs will be created to maintain the robots, but far fewer (and not for the same people who were displaced).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When workers lose employer-based insurance, they don’t stop getting sick. They turn to Medicaid or subsidized exchange plans. That strains government budgets, lowers hospital reimbursements and pushes insurers to raise commercial premiums even higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless the cost of medical care drops dramatically, the gorilla’s impact will reverberate throughout society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;4. The Gorilla In Rural Hospitals &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost crisis is devastating people everywhere, but perhaps nowhere more than in rural America. Over the past two decades, &lt;a href="https://ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=110927" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=110927" aria-label="150 rural hospitals have closed"&gt;150 rural hospitals have closed&lt;/a&gt; or stopped offering inpatient services. &lt;a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hundreds-rural-hospitals-risk-closing-center-healthcare-quality-payment-reform/723555/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hundreds-rural-hospitals-risk-closing-center-healthcare-quality-payment-reform/723555/" aria-label="Another 700 facilities"&gt;Another 700 facilities&lt;/a&gt; (nearly one-third of those remaining) are at risk of shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With small patient populations and high fixed costs, many rural hospitals can no longer provide inpatient care. But instead of reducing the high cost of care delivery, most communities pursue short-term relief: emergency grants, temporary bailouts and added Congressional funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These efforts can delay closure, but they don’t change the math. Even when hospital beds are empty, the buildings must be staffed, heated, insured and maintained, turning every day into a financial loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To survive, the model will have to change, and painful sacrifices will be necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;3 Solutions For Addressing The Gorilla Everywhere &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid a systemwide collapse, our nation will need to tackle healthcare’s invisible gorilla: the $5.6 trillion cost of care delivery. Structural reform, not minor tweaks, will be required to cut $700 billion a year in medical spending. The good news? Three already exist: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="subhead3-embed"&gt;A Leaner Hospital Footprint&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;America has too many inpatient facilities providing duplicate services at high fixed costs. A more sustainable system would consolidate low-volume hospitals and eliminate overlapping specialty programs in crowded markets. It would create regional centers of excellence that deliver superior outcomes at half today’s cost and transition small rural hospitals into 24-hour emergency and urgent-care hubs supported by telemedicine and reliable, low-cost transportation systems connected to larger facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on these gorilla-busting solutions, check out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="subhead3-embed"&gt;Preventing Diseases Before They Happen &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, more effective control of chronic disease could reduce healthcare spending by up to $1.8 trillion by preventing as many as half of all heart attacks, strokes, cancers, and kidney failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three pragmatic opportunities stand out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expand the primary-care workforce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow the government to negotiate drug prices for all medications, including GLP-1 compounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use generative AI tools to empower patients and expand home monitoring. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every life-threatening complication avoided is a hospital admission, ICU stay or surgery that never happens — and is never billed. For more on these solutions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="subhead3-embed"&gt;Paying For Value, Not Volume&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s fee-for-service system rewards hospitals and clinicians for doing more, not doing better. Capitation — payments made directly to physician groups and hospitals — incentivizes providers to prevent disease, avoid complications and maximize patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When healthcare organizations receive a fixed amount to care for a population, they benefit most financially by keeping patients healthy. Under capitation:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevention is rewarded, not ignored.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic diseases are managed earlier and better, before complications develop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care shifts to the most effective, efficient settings, including centers of excellence and low-cost, convenient virtual platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitation at the delivery-system level creates a virtuous cycle: healthier patients, fewer complications and dramatically lower cost. For more:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single group — elected officials, businesses, insurers, clinicians nor patients — can fix our nation’s healthcare. Success will require all stakeholders to overcome their inattentional blindness and confront the gorilla together. The only question is how much worse things must become before they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Forbes</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 09:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOS3NvX0pQUE9tekt3TU9zSjVwb1N2VDNIS2N0RkZnSWFieUdhZzF2RGxBV0t2aHBIUGVzTmZCcTE5b25ueW1JSjNiWjBSQUk5cnRTUGR5akFBM1E4MHhTU01EdUFqSDFmelF1ZjdNaHdnMm5NTjNjMUN5eGdEWk5xejJkYjVzd3FtbmJWek9YNGVKdkQ1YTExY0pYOTFia19TdU83TjlaU2szOGVaOHdz</guid></item><item><title>缅因州专家警告说，今年的流感季节可能会更糟-波特兰新闻先驱报</title><link>https://www.pressherald.com/2025/11/17/flu-season-could-be-severe-in-maine-and-around-the-u-s/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		&lt;p&gt;A strain of the influenza virus that’s not a precise match for the vaccine has been spreading in the U.K., Canada and Japan, among other countries, and could sicken many in the U.S. this flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flu is on our doorstep, and &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/02/19/weekly-influenza-cases-nearly-double-in-maine-in-last-three-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;soon it will be knocking on our door,&lt;/a&gt;” said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth. “It may be a more severe season than normal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mills said H3N2 tends to be a more potent strain, especially in older adults, which can result in more hospitalizations and illness in long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maine reported 17,793 flu cases during the 2024-25 flu season, which runs from October through May, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. So far this year, Maine has recorded 90 cases of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists each February predict what the predominant circulating strains will be for the following influenza season. Because it takes time to manufacture and distribute the vaccines, sometimes the predictions are not exact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every once in a while we see a shift in the virus that makes the vaccine not a great match,” said Anna Krueger, a Maine CDC epidemiologist. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the message from public health officials hasn’t varied: Get your flu shot, if you haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dominant circulating strain in the Northern Hemisphere is Influenza A H3N2, according to the World Health Organization. Small variations in the H3N2 strain – called subclades – took scientists by surprise when they &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/01/08/flu-surging-in-maine-covid-19-prevalence-also-very-high/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;emerged at the end of the flu season&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean the flu vaccine doesn’t work at all. It will still offer protection, especially from severe illness, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, Krueger said, other strains of the flu virus, such as Influenza A, H1N1 or Influenza B, may become the predominant strain at any time during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “It’s too early to tell if any one strain will dominate,” Krueger said. “There’s no typical flu season, but many times we will see Influenza A in the early season, and Influenza B later.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flu cases caused by H3N2 have tripled in the U.K., according to news reports.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;“Since it’s emerged, (H3N2) is rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the northern hemisphere,” Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization’s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Krueger said people can get the flu shot and the updated &lt;a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/09/25/fall-covid-19-shots-available-in-maine-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; during the same appointment. Both vaccines are widely available at doctor’s offices and pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to getting vaccinated, to avoid flu, “stay home when sick and practice good hand hygiene.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations are available to protect against RSV, another seasonal respiratory illness. RSV vaccines are available for those 50 and older, and those who are between 32 to 36 weeks pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a slow build-up of insulin resistance, years before diagnosis.” She further breaks down what’s really going on beneath the surface:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dipika, “When you eat multiple times a day (even ‘healthy’ snacks), your insulin never gets a break.” She explains that constantly elevated insulin levels push the body into fat-storing mode:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High insulin means your body constantly stores fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low insulin means your body burns fat for fuel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this imbalance leads to symptoms many people ignore, yet they’re clear warnings of rising insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early signs you may be developing insulin resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dipika says these are the signs most people notice but don’t connect with prediabetes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/belly-fat" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="belly fat"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; that refuses to go&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Energy crashes after meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight gain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin tags, cravings, and constant bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/17/original/graphic_1763366179398.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="To address early diabetes signs, Dipika Rampa advises on meal structure, emphasising fibre and protein, post-meal activity, and muscle building.(Google Gemini)" title="To address early diabetes signs, Dipika Rampa advises on meal structure, emphasising fibre and protein, post-meal activity, and muscle building.(Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;To address early diabetes signs, Dipika Rampa advises on meal structure, emphasising fibre and protein, post-meal activity, and muscle building.(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simple habits that can help reverse insulin resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dipika emphasises, “You can reverse this naturally by making small but powerful shifts.” Her recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1️⃣&lt;strong&gt; Stop grazing all day:&lt;/strong&gt; Eat 2–3 balanced meals with no snacks in between&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2️⃣&lt;strong&gt; Add fibre before carbs:&lt;/strong&gt; Slows glucose spikes and keeps you full&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Prioritise protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Ensure every meal includes a strong protein source&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Move after meals:&lt;/strong&gt; Even a 10-minute walk helps lower blood sugar&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5️⃣&lt;strong&gt; Build lean muscle: &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s your body’s best insulin regulator,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

                Cognitive function tends to get worse as we age. But both mental and physical exercise can help fight that decline.

   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have found the first compelling evidence that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines as people age. The results of this 10-week study back earlier animal research showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. And other studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can improve thinking and memory. So how does it all work? And by &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; does it all work?
