It’s not just a “smoker’s disease” non-smokers are increasingly being diagnosed too, thanks to air pollution, passive smoke, and genetic factors. The scary part? Early symptoms often feel harmless, a lingering cough, breathlessness, or fatigue that most people brush off. But catching it early makes all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month is about spreading awareness, encouraging regular screenings like low-dose CT scans for those at risk, and reminding everyone that quitting smoking really does save lives. Even better, lung health can bounce back with time, good nutrition, and clean air habits. So if you’ve been ignoring that cough or skipping your health checks, maybe November’s the perfect time to start paying attention,because your lungs are literally your life’s breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;8 yoga poses to improve lung capacity and strengthen respiratory muscles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Associate Director &amp;amp; Unit Head, Surgical Oncology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Chairman, Surgical Oncology, Andromeda Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the early warning signs and symptoms of lung cancer that people often overlook?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people dismiss the early signs of lung cancer because they resemble common chest or seasonal issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cough that lingers for weeks, mild chest discomfort, hoarseness, or breathlessness on routine activities can all be early indicators. Some may notice fatigue or recurrent chest infections. Even small traces of blood in sputum should never be ignored and need medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, lung cancer is often hard to detect as the symptoms are considered to be minor. The symptoms include a cough which persists for more than three weeks, blood in sputum, shortness of breath without explanation, frequent chest infections, pain in the chest or back, changes in the voice, loss of weight, or tiredness. These symptoms should always be taken seriously, particularly by smokers or those living in polluted areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does smoking increase the risk of lung cancer, and are non-smokers equally vulnerable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Both the experts say:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals — many of which are carcinogens that damage DNA in lung cells. The longer and heavier a person smokes, the greater their chance of developing lung cancer. But non-smokers aren’t completely safe — prolonged exposure to air pollution, secondhand smoke, or genetic factors can also trigger cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most powerful step to prevent lung cancer is to quit smoking completely—there’s no safe limit. Avoid secondhand smoke, reduce exposure to air pollution and workplace chemicals, and keep your home well-ventilated. Use air purifiers, clean-burning fuels, and wear protective masks on high-pollution days. People with a history of heavy smoking should discuss annual low-dose CT scans with their doctor for early detection. Regular health checkups and vaccinations for flu and pneumonia further support long-term lung health. Striking out smoking and improving air quality together create a strong defense against lung damage and cancer," advise the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does diet, exercise, and overall lifestyle influence lung health and cancer prevention?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good nutrition and regular exercise make a real difference. Foods rich in antioxidants—like leafy greens, fruits, and nuts—help protect cells from damage. Physical activity keeps the lungs strong and supports better oxygen flow. Avoiding processed foods, alcohol, and polluted environments also goes a long way in preserving lung health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life that is well-balanced is the main factor to lung immunity. Include antioxidant-rich food such as fruits, green leafy vegetables, turmeric, and nuts in your diet and at the same time cut down on fried or processed foods. Dedicate 30 to 45 minutes for daily exercise which will increase your lung capacity. If you are at a healthy weight, restrict alcohol intake, and practice relaxation methods and deep-breathing exercises such as pranayama, then your lungs will be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should ex-smokers do to lower their long-term lung cancer risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not start smoking again and have yearly lung check-ups. People between 50-80 years old with a history of heavy smoking may consider getting low-dose CT scans. Along with this, eating healthy, staying active, and avoiding exposure to pollutants and smoke from others are some of the measures that can be taken. These actions will bring down the risk of lung cancer in ex-smokers and promote good respiratory health," recommends Dr Goel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even after quitting, it’s important to stay committed to a healthy lifestyle. Eat well, exercise regularly, and go for periodic health checks. Discuss lung screening with your doctor, especially if you smoked for several years. The body continues to heal over time—lung function and risk both improve steadily after quitting," advises Dr Pachaury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the biggest myths or misconceptions about lung cancer that you’d like to correct?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth is that lung cancer only affects smokers, but anyone can develop it — though smoking remains the leading cause. Non-smokers face risks from air pollution, secondhand smoke, and genetic factors. Another misconception is that quitting smoking doesn’t help once damage is done, which is completely false. The benefits of quitting begin within weeks, and the risk keeps dropping every year. Early detection offers the best chance of cure, and newer therapies continue to improve survival. Persistent cough or breathlessness should never be ignored, and no herbal remedy can reverse the DNA damage caused by smoking, say the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxNY2RQVFd1ZVlzdHRSQTQ4TEJjbGQzLW5QWUd2TFNLSWh1Tm5sUzloVllLUmFKTUFpeEF3RkVSVkM1WWZ0THBKOTdNNWNoOGZySDREejBpVXdYV1ZKUkNMeWpGZ2NsWHJxWng4QnJBWWpsbXg5cFdfZzlxUzlfdVVQMFNfbVQ1Q01kaDFHZk5ITG5OYl94UHI3Z0g0c2ZlNkNTVzVHWEFtcHBnZVYxQ3htVnd3YWhDdjgyclRLLTEyUWJBbERWWEZRMnJic2kwdWZaNC1DNFZsam41TmdURHNTM2RpSG5tbWhGb01yeGwyR2M3NlhfZVFDTmxSeG5FRGROanNqdzhTbTdicHdlblp2WFFlUkxsVmxDNERhcnczT0FEZEFQZmtF</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，分区可能是您大脑的冲洗周期- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/zoning-out-may-be-your-brains-rinse-cycle-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We're all familiar with the feeling of zoning out, especially when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;we're sleep-deprived&lt;/a&gt;. A new study suggests these brief wanderings of attention are our brain's attempts to catch up on maintenance that usually happens while we snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), used brain measurements taken by both electroencephalogram (EEG) caps and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periods of zoning out – or "attentional failures", in the words of the study – were accompanied by a wave of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-vital-fluid-protects-your-most-important-organ-what-happens-if-it-fails"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; (CSF) flowing out of the brain, before it returned a second or two later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;Fragments of Bacteria in Our Gut May Lull Our Brains to Sleep at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns matched the waves of CSF that usually happen during &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;. The thinking is that this nightly fluid flow helps wash away waste products that build up during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn't see them," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Laura Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, they come with an attentional trade-off, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179946" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CerebralSpinalFluidFlowWhenAwake-642x314.png" alt="A graph with two lines, one red and the other blue, charting fluid flows in the sleep-derived versus well-rested brain.

(Yang et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants were each tested twice: after a night of restful sleep and after a night in the lab with no sleep at all. Unsurprisingly, their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt; during the study tests was generally worse when they hadn't gotten any shut-eye the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While zoning out occasionally happened &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;after a full night's slumber&lt;/a&gt;, it was much more common after the participants had stayed awake all night. It's almost as if the brain is trying to catch up with a burst of microsleep, at the temporary cost of your mind's focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179832" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow.jpg" alt="Brain scan charts" class="wp-image-179832 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow-600x493.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179832" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at CSF flow and periods of zoning out ("omissions") after a full night of sleep and after a night of no sleep. Higher flows were recorded when reaction times slowed down (C; data from one test run is shown). (Yang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Neurosci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Zinong Yang, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your brain's fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that sleep is absolutely essential to our health and well-being. Missing out on these periods of rest increases &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-deprivation-can-be-deadly-here-s-what-sleeping-less-than-7-hours-per-night-does-to-your-body-and-brain"&gt;our risk of disease&lt;/a&gt;, causes impairments in certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-an-alarming-pattern-in-the-brains-of-sleep-deprived-kids"&gt;parts of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, and changes our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/being-sleep-deprived-actually-changes-the-way-we-see-other-people"&gt;perspective on the world&lt;/a&gt;. And this study shows some of the ways the brain tries to catch up with missed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the outflow and influx of CSF was the most notable physiological change accompanying attentional failures, the researchers also found that breathing and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-pattern-in-your-pulse-could-signal-future-cognitive-decline"&gt;heart rate slowed&lt;/a&gt;, and pupil size got smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn't investigate these findings in much detail, but have a hypothesis that periods of zoning out may affect the body as a whole, possibly managed by a single control system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest to us," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lewis, "that there's a unified circuit that's governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain – our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world – and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02098-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"One of my gym friends is on [weight loss] jabs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Baxi says he refused, asking him what he would do after losing 10kg on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Stop, and the weight comes back. Keep going, and without exercise you'll start losing muscle instead. These medicines aren't a substitute for a proper diet or lifestyle change," he told him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Such conversations are becoming increasingly common as demand for weight-loss drugs explodes in urban India - a country with the world's second-largest number of overweight adults and more than 77 million people with Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Originally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs are now being hailed as game changers for weight loss, offering results that few previous treatments could match. Yet their growing popularity has also raised difficult questions - about the need for medical supervision, the risks of misuse and the blurred line between treatment and lifestyle enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"These are the most powerful weight-loss drugs we've ever seen. Many such drugs have come and gone, but nothing compares to these," says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Two new drugs dominate India's fast-growing weight-loss market. One is semaglutide, sold by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk as Rybelsus (oral) and Wegovy (injectable) - while Ozempic (injectable) has been approved for diabetes in India but is not yet available for obesity. The other is tirzepatide, marketed by American drugmaker Eli Lilly as Mounjaro, primarily for diabetes but increasingly used for weight loss in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Both belong to a class known as GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger. By slowing digestion and acting on the brain's appetite centres, they make people feel full faster and stay full longer. Taken once a week, most of these drugs are self-injected in the arm, thigh or stomach.

Prolonged use without exercise or strength training can also strip away muscle along with fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Also, not everyone responds to GLP-1 drugs, and most plateau after losing about 15% of their body weight. Side effects range from nausea and diarrhoea to rarer risks such as gallstones, pancreatitis and muscle loss. India's high-carb, low-protein diet already fuels sarcopenic obesity - the loss of muscle alongside fat gain - and weight loss without adequate protein or exercise can make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"With all the media hype and social media buzz, these drugs have become something of a craze among affluent Indians eager to shed a few kilos," says Dr Baxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The frenzy, a Delhi-based physician recalls, was evident even at a recent medical conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Three months after the launch of a new drug, I'd treated about a hundred patients. A colleague said he'd done over a thousand - most using imported jabs bought on the black market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;India's anti-obesity drug market has surged from $16m in 2021 to nearly $100m today - a more than sixfold jump in five years, according to Pharmarack, a research firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Novo Nordisk leads the market with its semaglutide brands, with Rybelsus alone accounting for nearly two-thirds of the market since its 2022 launch, according to the firm. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro), launched earlier this year, had become India's second-bestselling branded drug by September, according to Pharmarack. Each monthly injectable pen - four weekly doses - of these drugs costs between 14,000-27,000 rupees ($157–300), steep for most Indians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg via Getty Images A Public Health Foundation of India worker conducts a blood glucose test for a patient during a free door-to-door screening program funded by Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Co. at a home in the farming village of Thana kalan, Haryana, India, on Thursday, July 13, 2017.

Come March, the patent for semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy - expires here, potentially unleashing a flood of cheaper generics and making them more accessible. Jefferies, an investment bank, calls it a "magic pill moment" for India, predicting the semaglutide market could reach $1bn with the right pricing, uptake, and government incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"What we have heard is that nearly a dozen companies are already ready with generic versions of Rybelsus, the oral drug," says Sheetal Sapale, vice-president at Pharmarack. "But as affordability improves, the risk of misuse rises too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors tell stories of patients being put on high dosage of weight-loss drugs by gym trainers, dieticians and beauty clinics with no authority to prescribe them. Some online pharmacies are delivering drugs after a cursory phone consultation in the absence of a prescription. Beauticians offer "bridal packages" promising rapid slimming before the big day. There are fears of spurious medicines flooding the market. Federal minister Jitendra Singh has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2157298" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;"advised caution"&lt;/a&gt; on the new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"One patient asked me if these new medicines could help his daughter lose seven kilos before her wedding - in three months," recalls Dr Bhaumik Kamdar, a Mumbai-based chest physician. "He wanted to know if they really work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One challenge in India, doctors say, is the way people perceive obesity - and how that shapes attitudes toward weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Most don't realise that obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease," says Dr Muffazal Lakhdawala, a Mumbai-based bariatric surgeon.  "Many people with chronic obesity try crash diets, lose some weight, then regain even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Here, if you're overweight, people assume you're well-fed and affluent. We've gone so far in avoiding the elephant in the room that we've normalised it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Obesity, doctors warn, is a gateway to a host of diseases. "It's linked to at least 20 cancers, infertility, osteoarthritis and fatty liver - now one of the leading causes of cirrhosis," says Dr Lakhdawala. Yet, despite it affecting nearly one in eight people globally, there's still no universal consensus on how to define or classify obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The arrival of these drugs has changed the conversation - obesity is now being treated as a disease, not just a lifestyle issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors across specialities are now turning to weight-loss drugs for more than just obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Two men performing squats with dumbbells in an open outdoor environment.

From just 200 procedures in 2004, the number soared to 40,000 in 2022 - a 200-fold rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Surgeons like Dr Lakdawala now run multidisciplinary programmes where patients on weight-loss drugs are first guided by endocrinologists, nutritionists, and psychologists for three to six months. "We don't hand out drugs casually," he says. "Those who don't respond to the drugs or have severe obesity are then considered for surgery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His message to the growing number of urban Indians seeking quick fixes is blunt: "Don't use the drugs for cosmetic weight loss - use it for life-threatening weight gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And for those chasing quick fixes to shed just five or 10kg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He has simpler advice: "Cut out sugar - it's the biggest evil.

			&lt;p&gt;Specially engineered 'young' immune cells could help to reverse the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-critical-age-when-your-thinking-begins-to-decline"&gt;effects of aging&lt;/a&gt; and the damage to brain cells caused by diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="179027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their natural state, these immune cells are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononuclear_phagocyte_system"&gt;mononuclear phagocytes&lt;/a&gt;, and they flow around the body, cleaning up waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we get older, however, these immune-cell cleaners &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2020.12.003"&gt;get a bit sloppy&lt;/a&gt;, clearing away less cellular debris and triggering more inflammation than before. Inflammation and protein aggregation are features of many age-related diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-in-the-brain-may-reveal-alzheimers-years-in-advance"&gt;including Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the US produced replacement squads of mononuclear phagocytes, using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"&gt;human induced pluripotent stem cells&lt;/a&gt; – starter cells that can be reprogrammed into many different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mice-hippocampus-enzyme-discovery-anti-aging-therapy"&gt;transfusions of blood&lt;/a&gt; or plasma from young mice improved cognitive decline in older mice, but that is difficult to translate into a therapy," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Clive Svendsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our approach was to use young immune cells that we can manufacture in the lab – and we found that they have beneficial effects in both aging mice and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg" alt="Immune cells graph" class="wp-image-179030 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask-600x608.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Older mice injected with 'young' immune cells (Aging iMP) performed as well as younger animals (injected with saline as a control) on novel object location tasks.

Like microglia, these mossy cells can be hit by old age and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers of mossy cells decline with aging and Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist and lead author Alexandra Moser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did not see that decline in mice receiving young mononuclear phagocytes, and we believe this may be responsible for some of the memory improvements that we observed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers originally hypothesized that mononuclear phagocytes could be part of the reason that blood plasma and bone marrow transfusions have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3569"&gt;the rejuvenating effects&lt;/a&gt; they do, and that idea was supported by the results here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the engineered immune cells that Moser and colleagues injected into mice didn't appear to reach the animals' brains, so the researchers figured the observed effects must be down to something produced by fitter, stronger mononuclear phagocytes circulating in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'young' cells may have released anti-aging proteins or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_vesicle"&gt;tiny parcels involved in cell-cell communication&lt;/a&gt;, called extracellular vesicles, that made their way to the brain, reducing inflammation and boosting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques From Brains of Mice Within Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that most of the benefits observed here were in the older mice, not the mice engineered to display signs of Alzheimer's disease. There was also plenty of Alzheimer's-related brain damage, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein&lt;/a&gt; buildup, that wasn't repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-develop-in-unique-ways-that-explain-some-mysteries-left-by-mice-models"&gt;no guarantee we'll see the same effects&lt;/a&gt; in human brains either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those limitations, the early signs of this approach are promising. If derived from a patient's own cells, engineered mononuclear phagocytes could alleviate some of the drawbacks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-blood-group-after-a-50-year-mystery"&gt;blood plasma&lt;/a&gt; transfusions and bone marrow transplants, so there's plenty of potential for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings show that short-term treatment improved cognition and brain health, making them a promising candidate to address age- and Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center neuropathologist Jeffrey Golden, who wasn't directly involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202417848"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"That's when they did the CAT scan, and that's when I got the phone call."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still remember the phone call," Lynita continued. "He was so calm.  He said 'So, it was not an ulcer.  They just told me I have stage 4 pancreatic cancer.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three short weeks later, Mark lost a very short battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silent killer shows very few symptoms before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say maybe 2-3 weeks prior to diagnosis.  His acid reflux had gotten tremendously more aggressive," Lynita said.   "He was belching more.  He had fatigue.  Then, like a week or two prior, we noticed bloating in his stomach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had no clue it would literally be three weeks from the time he was diagnosed to the time that he passed," Lynita said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/mark-spain-beloved-abc13-anchor-and-community-figure-dies-after-battle-with-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Spain, beloved ABC13 anchor and community figure, dies after battle with cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is rare; just 1.6% of us are at risk of being diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you don’t often see symptoms early on, according to Centra oncologist Dr. Susannah Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger." class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/0x316/90/60c63b2f-9f81-4ffa-bf2b-db149c68e756-thumbnail_IMG_2085.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think something that's really important to remember for pancreatic cancer or anything is that you really have to listen to your body," Cooper said. "I wouldn't ignore any symptoms.  Especially symptoms that persist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to symptoms like sudden weight loss, abdominal pain, clay-colored bowels or chronic diarrhea, jaundice, or yellowing of the skin or eyes, fatigue and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a family history of pancreatic cancer, genetic counseling can be a tool for early detection and treatment, according to Kelsey Newell, a genetic counselor with Centra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, genetic testing would be offered to those patients very shortly after their diagnosis so we can try to get a better understanding of any genetic mutations they carry that can help us be better informed of their treatment plan," Newell said.  "And identify targeted options for their therapy.  Also, provide that risk information to their family members."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery to remove the cancer and chemotherapy can help survival rates, but only 15-20% of cases are diagnosed at an early enough stage to be treated before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when I started in oncology, we had very little treatments for pancreatic cancer," said Dr. Cooper ."Over the last 5-10 years, we've gotten better and better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper said they've come a long way in developing innovative ways to help survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually have medications that can block those mutations and work specifically to attack your tumor," Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Kunk, an oncologist at UVA's cancer center, said cancer vaccines are also in clinical trials right now to help cure more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having those patients undergo the same chemotherapy and then injecting a personalized cancer vaccine as well as an immune therapy medication to help rev up one’s immune system  to recognize those cancer proteins and mount a response to them and go after and kill all of them," Kunk explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer you should consider: cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and chronic pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor about potentially being screened if you are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)" class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media/e72c0a07-da0d-430a-b2ed-bb0cb87f15ff-large16x9_AnchorMarkSpain2.png?1652040520167"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynita doesn't know when Mark's cancer started--just that his symptoms presented too late in the game to offer any chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was one of the most aggressive cases they had seen in a while," Spain said.

Reporting in the journal Neurology Open Access, the team also warned that people with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;both gum disease and cavities are at an 86 per cent greater risk of a stroke compared with those who have good dental habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/flossing-your-teeth-once-a-week-cuts-risk-of-stroke-by-one-fifth-d8lcqbb3q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flossing your teeth once a week ‘cuts risk of stroke by one fifth’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The latest study monitored 5,986 adults in their fifties and sixties, none of whom had suffered a stroke when the investigation started, over 20 years. After accounting for variables such as age, body mass index and smoking, which all affect oral health, they found that those who visited their dentist regularly were 81 per cent less likely to have the gum disease and cavities tied to serious cardiovascular events, such as fatal heart disease and stroke, which cuts blood supply to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This study reinforces the idea that taking care of your teeth and gums isn’t just about your smile; it could help protect your brain,” said Souvik Sen, a professor of neurology and lead author of the paper. “People with signs of gum disease or cavities should seek treatment not just to preserve their teeth, but potentially to reduce stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Taking good care of your teeth could even reduce your risk of dementia. A study in Neurology found gum disease and tooth loss were tied to shrinkage in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that plays a role in memory and Alzheimer’s disease. There’s evidence, too, that the delicate bacterial balance in the mouth, known as the oral microbiome, may be implicated in memory loss and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a study of 115 midlifers published this year&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Anne Corbett, a professor of dementia research at the University of Exeter, found that certain types of bacteria in the mouth are associated with better memory, focus and attention, while others are linked to poor brain health and dementia. In future, she says, it could lead to the development of DIY tests to detect early signs that someone is at elevated risk of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-foods-to-eat-and-avoid-for-maintaining-healthy-teeth-mpbsw2jq8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The foods to eat and the ones to avoid for healthy teeth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The potential for profiling dementia risk through at-home sampling is exciting,” Corbett says. “It is possible that the [oral] microbiome could form part of a battery of tests that would be used for this purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oral hygiene — brushing twice a day and using floss or interdental brushes — remains the most important step, but thinking beyond that with steps that can improve our teeth and gums is increasingly considered a powerful way to protect against disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“People see their general health as separate from their oral health,” Sikka says. “They don’t see the mouth as connected to the body, yet the mouth-body connection is extremely strong.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Here’s how you can improve the health of your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Make sure you get plenty of omega-3 fats in your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.13"&gt;&lt;div id="30c4c9d4-a187-47cf-ba51-f1240d283fb5"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon have anti-inflammatory effects on the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We are all encouraged to eat more fatty fish for general health, but many of us don’t realise that the benefits of the essential healthy omega-3 oils they contain extend to improvements in our oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon, sardines and mackerel have anti-inflammatory effects on the body,” Shahid says. “Some studies show that when people with gum disease take omega-3s alongside dental treatment, their gums heal a little better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One recent investigation in the journal Scientific Reports suggested that combining omega-3 supplementation with regular exercise had a potent effect on lowering inflammation and helping the immune system to fight off chronic tooth root infections. It also helped to protect teeth from bone loss. The NHS recommends we eat at least one portion of oily fish a week. “Other good sources of omega-3 fats include flaxseed and walnuts,” Shahid says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Take a daily beetroot shot and eat your leafy greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some beneficial oral bacteria are known to play a key role in turning nitrate to nitric oxide, which has been shown in numerous studies to relax and widen blood vessels and improve blood flow around the body, including to the brain. Research by Anni Vanhatalo, professor in the faculty of health and life sciences at the University of Exeter, and Corbett has shown that eating plenty of nitrate-rich foods, including beetroot, can help with that process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In ongoing studies looking at the effects on oral health of taking a daily beetroot shot for 12 weeks Vanhatalo and Corbett have found that nitrate supplementation causes changes in mouth bacteria that are associated with healthier blood vessels and brain function as we age. They have also seen that levels of many harmful species of bacteria linked to inflammation decrease when beetroot shots are consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We have shown that chronic nitrate supplementation [with beetroot shots] increases the proportion of nitrite-producing oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says. “This change is particularly beneficial in older people because as we age, our ability to produce nitric oxide via alternative pathways decreases.” Beetroot shots are one option, but leafy greens such as spinach, rocket and other salad leaves are also good sources of dietary nitrate. “We know that a nitrate-rich diet such as the Mediterranean diet or Dash diet is an effective intervention to reduce the proportion of potentially harmful oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Regularly exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Staying fit has benefits for your oral health, as a recent review in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care demonstrated. Dental researchers looked at the effects of regular intense physical exercise — running, cycling, swimming and competitive sports — and found that the physically active “have lower levels of inflammatory biological markers, which is linked to better oral health”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They also revealed that regular exercise has a positive effect on salivary antigens, substances in saliva that can trigger a positive immune response, as well as improved oral muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Exercise improves blood flow, lowers levels of inflammation in the body that exacerbate gum disease, and helps control conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure that can make gum problems worse,” Shahid says. “While a workout in the gym won’t clean your teeth, staying active supports the gums and tissues that keep them in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Get plenty of fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Few of us get the recommended 30g of fibre a day that the NHS says we need for good health. We tend to think of fibre as improving our gut health and digestion, but its effects are far-reaching and by increasing our intake with more wholegrains, fruit and vegetables, we may inadvertently boost the health of our teeth and gums. A review by dental experts from Australia, New Zealand and India found that people who consumed 22-30g of fibre daily had less swelling of the gums, less plaque build-up and stronger tissues surrounding the teeth. It suggests “a fibre-rich daily diet may offer promise as a complementary approach for the prevention and management of periodontal diseases”, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Crunchy foods such as celery, raw carrots and peppers promote oral health not just because of the immune enhancing antioxidants they contain, but because they physically scrub the teeth as you chew them. Think of them as nature’s own interdental brushes, Sikka says. “All high-fibre foods act a bit like a natural cleanser as they rub against your teeth when you chew,” he says. “In addition, the chewing they require stimulates saliva production, which, in conjunction with good brushing and flossing habits, helps to remove plaque from the teeth.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Eat cheese after a meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.33"&gt;&lt;div id="f2f1573e-c34a-417a-b1f3-38a2d47f51b0"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Cheese helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Cheese is good news for your oral health. “It is not only rich in calcium and phosphorus, which strengthen your tooth enamel, but cheese also helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth,” Sikka says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Consuming a small piece of cheese after eating acidic foods or drinks — ultra-processed foods and fizzy drinks — can help to raise pH levels in the mouth, reducing levels of bacteria that over a long term can lead to decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a small trial at Western Kentucky University researchers gave participants 28g of mild cheddar 60 seconds after they had sipped some cola. Tests showed that the cheese helped to “provide a protective shield around the teeth that fights the release of acids”, the researchers wrote. Cheese also increases the flow of saliva, preventing bacteria from sticking to tooth surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Consider a deep-cleaning treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Data from the latest Adult Oral Health Survey commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care suggests that in England 19 per cent of adults and up to 28 per cent of those aged 55-64 said they had been told they had gum disease. Gum disease can be treated on the NHS — national guidelines include deep cleaning under local anaesthesia as part of the programme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Marco Orlandi, honorary associate professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, recently published findings of a two-year clinical trial in the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;European Heart Journal that found that this type of deep cleaning can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 10 per cent each year compared with those who underwent a routine scale and polish. By reducing the amount of gum inflammation and bacteria entering the bloodstream, the deep cleaning helped to slow the thickening of the carotid arteries, the blood vessels supplying oxygen to the

In severe cases, it can lead to abscesses, perforation, or bowel obstruction, which could require surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for developing diverticulitis is over 50, with studies showing mean ages of around 52 to 64 for diagnosed cases. But trends could be shifting, the new study shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From looking at more &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx"&gt;than 5.2 million&lt;/a&gt; hospitalizations included in the National Inpatient Sample, the researchers found a troubling surge in severe diverticulitis cases among Americans younger than 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that the proportion of younger patients admitted with complicated diverticulitis rose from 18.5 percent to 28.2 percent, a 52 percent relative increase over the 15-year period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, roughly 16 percent of the 5.2 million patients hospitalized for diverticulitis in that timeframe were under 50, classifying them as early-onset cases. Past research suggests the Western diet, with processed foods and a high red meat consumption, could be to blame for the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Diverticulitis is the inflammation or infection of small pouches called diverticula that form in the wall of the colon. It typically causes abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers in the new study noted that the reasons behind the rise in early-onset diverticulitis remain unclear, other studies have made the link to certain lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A large‑scale lifestyle and genetics study by Mass General Brigham in 2025 found that individuals with a healthier lifestyle (non‑smoking, a BMI less than 25, higher physical activity, higher fiber intake, lower red meat consumption) had substantially lower risk of diverticulitis, even if they had a high genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile several studies, particularly a large-scale twin 2012 study conducted in Sweden, have linked diverticulitis to genetics, with estimates suggesting that 40 to 53 percent of the risk is heritable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study further highlighted differences between younger and older patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset patients generally had lower mortality rates, shorter hospital stays - about a quarter of a day less on average - and lower hospital costs, roughly $1,900 less per admission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, younger patients were more likely to need invasive interventions, with 29 percent higher odds of a colectomy (a surgery to remove part or all of the colon) and 58 percent higher odds of needing the area to be drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colectomy is a surgical solution for severe, complicated, or recurrent diverticulitis, not a solution for all cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For milder cases, treatment typically involves antibiotics and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the proportion of younger patients undergoing colectomy decreased from 34.7 percent to 20.3 percent, suggesting that more cases are being managed successfully earlier on without surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author and fourth-year medical student at UCLA Shineui Kim said of this finding: 'While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they're paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actor Josh Gad, 44, said using a GLP-1 drug for weight loss caused him to get diverticulitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that further research is 'urgently needed' to explore exactly what is behind the boom in early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study appears in the journal Diseases in the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend, the researchers said, mirrors similar increases in colorectal cancer among younger Americans, raising public health concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An investigation by the American Cancer Society (ACS) found that after a stable 15-year trend, diagnoses of local-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) rose dramatically in adults aged 45 to 49 years old between 2019 and 2022 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among this age group, cases were increasing one percent annually from 2004 to 2019, but that increase accelerated to 12 percent per year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people 20 to 39 years old, CRC incidence has increased steadily by 1.6 percent annually since 2004 and by two percent and 2.6 percent annually since 2012 among adults 40 to 44 and 50 to 54 years old, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, from 2021 to 2022, there was a 50 percent relative increase in diagnoses, rising from 11.7 per 100,000 people to 17.5 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This steep increase was driven by the detection of early, local-stage tumors, which increased from 2019 to 2022 by 19 percent per year for colon cancer and by 25 percent per year for rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Monica - who does not give her last name - found it difficult to get doctors to listen to her health concerns. The Australian, who is currently living in Croatia, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last year when she was 31 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study's lead author Elizabeth Schafer attributed the rise in colon cancer diagnoses to new recommendations that lowered the screening age for the disease. A second ACS report found CRC screening among US adults 45 to 49 years of age increased by 62 percent from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended age to begin CRC screening was lowered from 50 to 45 by the ACS in 2018 and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) followed suit in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This guy’s very first troponin was 21.00. TWENTY-ONE. The highest we’ve ever had up till then was an 8.00. The guy should’ve been dead ages ago, but he somehow pulled through. Don’t ignore chest pains, people."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Also, just wanna clarify that the hospital I work for is a tiny-ass, 25-bed, rural-community critical care hospital. Definitely not a place with dedicated cardiologists, cath lab, bedside assays, or even a big test menu, period. Bare basics! And the guy did, somehow, end up surviving."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LimeGap/" target="_blank"&gt;LimeGap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the cause of covid-19, isn’t the only coronavirus in the world we should be keeping our eye on. Scientists appear to have just discovered a new branch of coronaviruses in Brazilian bats that could have the tools needed to spill over and infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large team of researchers in Japan and Brazil identified the possible zoonotic threat in a preliminary study released last week. The viral relative appears to be genetically distinct from other coronaviruses yet shares a feature with SARS-CoV-2 that may allow its kind to infect human cells. The findings suggest there are plenty of native bat coronaviruses in the wild with the potential to cause new epidemics in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The high diversity of viruses in bats therefore positions them as a key taxonomic group for zoonotic disease surveillance,” the authors &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684489v1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, presented as a preprint on the website bioRxiv.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A key similarity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even prior to the emergence of covid-19 more than five years ago, scientists had been worried about &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-not-ready-for-the-next-pandemic-1839169413"&gt;coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; causing the next big pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, its earlier ancestor SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are coronaviruses that successfully became human pathogens over the past two decades; all three belong to the betacoronavirus genus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the study researchers, however, almost everything we know about the diversity of this genus is based on data collected from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, with little genetic sequencing of such viruses in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To help remedy this gap in knowledge, the team analyzed gut tissue samples collected from 70 bats in three sites across Brazil between May and August 2019. They found the new virus in a Parnell’s mustached bat (&lt;em&gt;Pteronotus parnellii&lt;/em&gt;) and completely sequenced its genome.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Based on their analysis, the virus—which they coined BRZ batCoV—is different enough genetically to represent a previously unknown subgenus of betacoronavirus. Until now, five subgenera had been identified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the virus also appears to have something important in common with SARS-CoV-2: a functional furin cleavage site (FCS) at the S1/S2 junction of its spike protein. In fact, the FCS in BRZ batCoV is only different by a single amino acid compared to the one in SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;How worried should we be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCS in SARS-CoV-2 is one of the features that helps it to infect humans. So finding something very similar in this new virus is certainly troubling. The researchers also note that other bat betacoronaviruses are known to have an FCS in the same location, suggesting it’s relatively easy for this feature to pop up in these viruses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another concerning aspect is that since there’s so little surveillance of Brazil and other areas in the Americas, it’s more than possible that BRZ batCoV and similar viruses have been circulating under our noses for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The new research hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, a vital part of vetting any new study. The researchers also point out that they haven’t directly examined the infectivity of BRZ batCoV, a caveat that limits how much we can know about its risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hence, although the presence of an FCS is clearly significant, any discussion of the zoonotic potential of this virus should be limited,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, this sort of research should be seen as an early warning signal. While the origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being debated—even if &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/virologists-and-epidemiologists-back-natural-origin-covid-19-survey-suggests"&gt;most virologists&lt;/a&gt; are in the natural camp—many human diseases do first start off as zoonotic germs that successfully jump from animals to people (case in point, the&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1472041/#:~:text=Additional%20SARS%20cases%20resulted%20from,virus%20to%20humans%20(60)."&gt; original SARS&lt;/a&gt;). Bats and the viruses they carry are a prime suspect for causing the next big pandemic, and it’s urgent that we better track what’s out there, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our study provides a broader understanding of the phylogenetic and functional diversity of bat coronaviruses as well as their zoonotic potential,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing the risk of a life-altering neurodegenerative disease by almost half sounds like it should require some sort of miraculous medicinal intervention, but an increasing number of scientific studies suggest it could be as simple as listening to music. In October 2025, the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published a study that found an incredibly strong association between mental health in old age and one’s connection to music. The study observed participants who both listened to music and played an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        
            &lt;p id="sv-video-container"&gt;
              
            &lt;/p&gt;
        
                
            



&lt;p&gt;Scientists discovered a 39% reduction in &lt;a href="https://americansongwriter.com/the-surprising-scientific-link-between-dementia-and-hit-songs-by-elvis-presley-abba-and-spice-girls/"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; in individuals who reported they “always” listened to music as opposed to “never,” “rarely,” or “sometimes.” Those who documented themselves as “often” or “always” playing a musical instrument saw a 35% reduction in dementia risk. Individuals who did both showed a 33% reduction. Listening to and playing music also helped reduce the risk of non-dementia cognitive decline. Interestingly, the study found stronger correlations between decreased dementia risk and music in individuals with over 16 years of education, as opposed to those with 15 years or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study published three months earlier, a different group of researchers found that the brains of older individuals who regularly played an instrument responded to stimuli in a manner that more closely resembled that of younger brains. Their non-musical counterparts, on the other hand, showed greater cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn’t need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training,” the study’s co-author, Dr. Yi Du, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/brain-musical-instrument" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told BBC Science Focus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-music-with-this-added-might-reduce-dementia-risk-even-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music With This Added Might Reduce Dementia Risk Even More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Listening to music of any kind can help reduce the risk of dementia in older individuals. But multiple studies suggest that listening to a specific frequency in tandem with one’s favorite music could be even more effective in minimizing the potential for cognitive decline. Researchers have long touted the benefits of 40 Hz stimulation with both light and sound can reduce Alzheimer’s disease pathology and symptoms in both mice and humans. In 2024, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457224000223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins School of Nursing&lt;/a&gt; found that combining participants’ favorite music with a 40 Hz stimulus further reduces the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Johns Hopkins researchers asked the study participants to listen to their “40 Hz music” for a minimum of one hour per day, preferably three hours before bed. By combining individuals’ favorite music with 40 Hz therapy, participants were more receptive to the treatment, which appears to minimize or reduce dementia-like symptoms. According to the study, this can “improve usability and practical enjoyment” of this specific type of therapy. (Because if a therapy is so unpleasant that no one wants to use it, then what’s the point?)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things we can do to maintain our health as we age, and not all of them are always pleasant. And while we’re by no means undermining the importance of eating specific foods, avoiding others, abstaining from alcohol or other drugs, and regularly exercising, listening to music seems to have just as many benefits for our mental health and is arguably way more enjoyable than some of those aforementioned risk-reduction activities. Happy listening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spending too much time being sedentary is the number one habit to break to burn visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smart exercise strategies such as starting small, setting a timer and variety can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition, sleep and stress management are all helpful in reducing visceral fat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Plank Challenge may be all over social media. But there’s another reason to burn off belly fat that has nothing to do with sculpting killer abs. Belly fat, technically known as visceral fat, can spell bad news for your health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve never heard of visceral fat before, this type of fat burrows deep into your abdomen, where it surrounds organs like the liver and intestines. That doesn’t just make your belly rounder. Visceral fat also cranks out inflammatory proteins that increase the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, your lifestyle habits can have a big impact on the amount of visceral fat you carry. If you’d like to trim belly fat and improve your health in the process, read on to learn the No. 1 habit to break to reduce visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re sitting down reading this, then stand up immediately. Then get ready for this … being too sedentary is the No. 1 habit you need to break ASAP to reduce visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why? Most of us are not nearly active enough (and spend way too much time sitting!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While physical activity guidelines recommend engaging in at least 150 minutes of activity per week, less than half of us actually meet these recommendations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yet, research reveals that increasing physical activity may be one of the best ways to stop the progression of diseases triggered by excess body fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By increasing movement, you can build lean body mass, which helps to increase overall resting metabolism, promoting more favorable body composition,” says &lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Movement also enhances fat metabolism and regulates insulin levels, helping the body burn stored fat more effectively.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Burning visceral fat may require some strategies. Here are some expert tips on how to do it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small: &lt;/strong&gt;Visceral fat may be stubborn, but you don’t have to run a marathon to get rid of it. “If you're new to regular movement, start with just 10 to 15 minutes of an activity you enjoy, like a walk around your neighborhood, dancing or yoga,” says &lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Fit in movement throughout the day in small ways, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking farther away, or taking the long way to the coffee machine at work to add more steps to your day,” adds Palinski-Wade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buddy Up:&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to make it a habit is to repeat it daily until it’s as normal as brushing your teeth. Bannan recommends teaming up with a friend to make your movement habit stick. “Celebrating small wins, like reaching a daily step goal, can build momentum and make it easier to stay active in the long term,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a Timer: &lt;/strong&gt;“Every 30 to 60 minutes, set a reminder to stand up, stretch or walk around for a couple of minutes,” says Bannan. “This breaks up long periods of sitting and helps stimulate circulation and muscle activity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace Around the House:&lt;/strong&gt; Palinski-Wade recommends walking while talking on the phone instead of sitting. “This way you are using time you already have to fit more movement into your busy day,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump Some Iron: &lt;/strong&gt;“Strength training is one of the best things you can do to offset visceral fat,” says Palinski-Wade. “Aim to add strength training one to two times per week, focusing on major muscle groups to improve strength and lean body mass.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix Up Your Workouts: &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training isn’t the only way to burn visceral fat. Research has found that three aerobic or interval workouts per week are also effective for reducing belly fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-reducing-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Tips for Reducing Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, moving is key, but there are even more steps you can take to lose visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log Those Zzz’s. &lt;/strong&gt;“Just one poor night of sleep can increase appetite and insulin resistance, making you more likely to eat excess calories and triggering your body to store more visceral fat versus burning it,” says Palinski-Wade. In addition to practicing good sleep hygiene, these&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291992/6-sleep-habits-that-can-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; healthy sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; can also help with weight management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chill Out.&lt;/strong&gt; “Mindfulness activities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindful eating &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stress-reducing practices&lt;/a&gt;, like meditation or deep breathing, can help lower cortisol levels, a hormone linked to visceral fat accumulation,” says Bannan. “Managing stress through mindfulness can be an effective way to support your body’s ability to burn fat, particularly in the abdominal area.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;“Adding more fiber to your diet can help to balance blood sugar, which in turn can lessen insulin resistance that stores visceral fat,” says Palinski-Wade. “In addition, dietary fiber helps to curb appetite and may promote weight loss, further lowering visceral fat levels.” Plus, high-fiber foods are often rich in antioxidants, which may offset inflammation and reduce stress hormones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Skimp on Fat.&lt;/strong&gt; It may sound counterintuitive, but in order to lose visceral fat, you have to eat healthy fats. “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fish-to-eat-for-weight-loss-8670654" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/a&gt; is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve fat metabolism,” says Bannan. “Including salmon or other fatty fish, like mackerel, sardines, herring or trout in your diet a couple of times a week can support your efforts to reduce visceral fat while also promoting heart and brain health.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no magic pill to reduce visceral body fat. However, nutrition experts agree that simply moving more can improve your body composition and reduce visceral body fat. And you don’t have to log hours in the gym to see results. While strength training and aerobic activity are excellent ways to burn belly fat, going for regular walks with a friend or scheduling movement breaks into your workday are great ways to incorporate more activity into your day. The goal is to rack up those 150 minutes of physical activity each week. And if you still want to do the Plank Challenge, well, that’s great too!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several lots of a prescription ADHD medication have been recalled due to "failed dissolution specifications," the Food and Drug Administration announced last week.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries of New Jersey recalled certain bottles of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules, a generic version of Vyvanse that was sold nationwide. The recall was initiated on Oct. 28 and given a Class II risk level by the FDA on Oct. 30.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Class II classification indicates that the recalled medication “may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,” but the risk of serious health consequences is low.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries recalled the medication due to “failed dissolution specifications,” meaning the drug did not dissolve as expected in laboratory settings, which could make it less effective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The manufacturer did not issue a press release about this recall, so there are no specific instructions for medication users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it's not recommended to stop ADHD medication abruptly, as it could cause withdrawal symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Check your medications at home, and if you have any bottles affected by the recall, don’t take them. Instead, contact your healthcare provider or pharmacy for guidance on obtaining a replacement bottle or refund.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p class="custom-html embed-container mv-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle isn’t the only city that’s faced difficult neighborhood conversations when deciding where to locate services aimed at helping people in mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan King County Council &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/king-county-council-approves-plans-funding-for-capitol-hill-crisis-center/" class="content-link"&gt;voted last month to place a walk-in mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; — a location that sparked discussions in the surrounding neighborhood and heated public comments at council meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the center say the facility is needed in the neighborhood, which struggles with disorder tied to homelessness, drug use and mental health. But some local residents, business owners and real estate owners voiced concern about how the center might affect public safety in the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://dchsblog.com/2025/10/01/listening-to-local-voices-community-engagement-for-the-seattle-crisis-care-center-location/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;King County says it has held nearly 60&lt;/a&gt; community conversations, presentations, walking tours and other events focused on the Capitol Hill location, some in the neighborhood say the county hasn’t sufficiently engaged with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. cities have also navigated community relationships and dealt with pushback as they seek to build centers adjacent to residential areas and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can Seattle learn from other cities’ experience? Similar centers in Denver and Milwaukee can provide lessons on managing relationships and operating a center successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008117-1353473057" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008117,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=300x226 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1024x772 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=768x579 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1536x1158 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2048x1544 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1020x769 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1560x1176 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2040x1538 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=375x283 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588","caption":"King County plans to site a new mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill, at a former Polyclinic building located at 1145 Broadway.

Almost half of residents are below the poverty line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Valley has a lot of publicly subsidized affordable housing, and a lot of families, said Jeanne Granville, president of the Sun Valley Community Coalition. Census data shows that more than half the population is under the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city’s vision for the center had a lot in common with &lt;a href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/crisis-response/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;DESC’s Crisis Solutions Center&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle — it would accept people via referrals from law enforcement and other first responders. People could access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city contracted with WellPower, a large mental health provider in Colorado, to operate the center. WellPower also partners with the Denver Police Department to send mental health professionals to calls alongside police. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were not necessarily the program that the neighborhood wanted,” said Ellen Todd, WellPower’s associate director for crisis services. “They wanted a youth program coming in, and this was not it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008046-2031076544" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008046,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1536x1024 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2048x1365 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1560x1040 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2040x1360 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"Inside the Behavioral Health Solutions Center in Denver, patients can access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit.

They didn’t really understand how the center would be structured or what it would do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a better understanding of who it was going to be, how it was going to serve folks, how it was going to operate was really important,” Granville said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the center opened, the community coalition and the provider worked with a mediator from the city to draft a &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/public-health-and-environment/documents/cbh/solutioncenter_goodneighboragreement.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Good Neighbor Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It outlined requirements WellPower (formerly named the Mental Health Center of Denver) and the city of Denver must follow, including 24/7 security staffing, the creation of a neighborhood advisory committee, and regular reporting on the center’s use. It also banned the center from admitting registered sex offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King County will require every center’s operator to create a good neighbor agreement with the surrounding community. For Capitol Hill, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell &lt;a href="https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/08/COS-CCC-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;has also asked the county&lt;/a&gt; to partner with Seattle police on a security assessment and plan for ongoing safe operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good neighbor agreements are really a useful tool to sit down and walk through those concerns and be proactive,” Granville said. “If there are things that come up, how will they be addressed quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wellpower.org/behavioral-health-solutions-center/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;The Behavioral Health Solutions Center opened in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and has had “very little effect” on the neighborhood, Granville said. Initially, WellPower held monthly meetings the neighborhood could attend; now they’re just quarterly “because things have been going so well,” Todd said. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;There’s a key difference from the center planned in Capitol Hill: Patients can’t walk in on their own. WellPower operates a walk-in crisis center in another part of the city, which served about 2,300 people in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville thinks a walk-in center would have been a “very different situation” that the Sun Valley community wouldn’t have been receptive to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the solutions center served 777 people. WellPower creates a discharge plan for every patient and offers Lyft rides or bus tickets to the next location they’re going to, Todd said. If they need shelter, they can stay in adjacent temporary housing for up to 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient transportation and discharge planning have also been questions in King County. The county has said money is designated for postdischarge stabilization, which will include staff to take patients to follow-up appointments and transportation to get them to their home, a shelter or another treatment facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville said the Sun Valley neighborhood’s safety concerns haven’t come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already know that there are people who are experiencing behavioral health and substance use crises in your neighborhood,” Todd said. “We are here to help them and to provide those services. Without us, people are walking around and they’re still experiencing a behavioral health or substance use crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Credible messengers&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unique requirement of Wisconsin’s involuntary treatment system led to a new emergency mental health center in Milwaukee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has a law that applies to large counties: People brought in on an involuntary mental health hold (which in Wisconsin, can only be initiated by police) must be assessed by a physician within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a mental health-specific emergency center plays a key role in streamlining the system, said Michael Lappen, Milwaukee County’s behavioral health administrator. It allows law enforcement to bring patients to a facility that’s specifically designed to evaluate and treat them, without putting that burden on generalized hospital emergency rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milwaukee County had for decades run a crisis emergency department as part of a larger mental health complex in Wauwatosa, a suburb west of the city. In 2018, it decided to outsource inpatient psychiatric care to Universal Health Services — but the private company declined to take responsibility for the emergency department, &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/solutions/2019/08/16/milwaukee-county-could-lose-its-psychiatric-crisis-center/1819222001/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the old mental health complex moved toward closure, the county had to figure out how to open a designated emergency center — “the thing that makes the system work here,” Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parcel was available next to the county’s human services building in the King Park neighborhood. The neighborhood is mostly residential and has some low income housing; it’s close to downtown, but separated by Interstate 43. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available property was also in the center of the need for mental health care. Data showed that 70% of people admitted to the county’s mental health crisis center were from the 53205 ZIP code (where the property is located) or one of nine adjacent ZIP codes, Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Lanier, a pastor in Milwaukee, was part of the county’s Mental Health Board and had previously launched a &lt;a href="https://wjlanier.com/miracle-mental-health-2/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;mental health ministry&lt;/a&gt; working to decrease stigma in the city’s Black community. He helped the county spread the word about the center with the community through listening sessions and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It increased their credibility and relationship with the community because we were credible messengers,” Lanier said. “That strong relationship with our network bore a lot of relational fruit. It’s extra significant in a city like Milwaukee that’s known for being highly segregated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lappen and Lanier said there wasn’t much pushback from the neighborhood community where the center was planned. Lanier appreciated the county’s intentionality in engaging during the planning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes that community engagement is thought of as an afterthought or an appendage to a process that’s already foregone,” Lanier said. “Because of our relationships and advocacy, that allowed for a richer process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://mentalhealthmke.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Mental Health Emergency Center&lt;/a&gt; opened in September 2022 and has averaged about 8,000 visits per year. Adults and youth can access medication and short-term care to help them stabilize; the average adult stay is seven hours, Lappen said. If patients need more intensive treatment, the center will help transfer them to inpatient care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of patients come in voluntarily and half are brought in on involuntary treatment holds. The county pays half of the operating costs and the rest is split among local hospital systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being adjacent to downtown is helpful, Lappen said, because people are able to access other services to get meals or shelters. There’s a large hospital two blocks away, where patients can be transferred if they need more intensive medical care. It’s also much faster for law enforcement and other first responders to bring patients in for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We went from being where nobody was to where 70% of the patients actually live,” Lappen said. “That’s why it’s working out so well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They haven’t seen increased crime or negative outcomes around the center, Lappen said. The effects have actually been positive: Fewer people living outside in the neighborhood, fewer people in crisis, less crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, Lanier said, the community has said the facility should be bigger so it could serve more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us, this is the bridge to get to service, and it makes the community better and healthier,” Lappen said. “If your community embraces that getting help actually shouldn’t be stigmatized, it should be celebrated, then you’ll see a culture where that’s accepted.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was, as my sports medicine doctor counseled, “time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since I was a teen, it had been my primary form of exercise and stress relief. But for months, I had been ignoring small signs of encroaching decrepitude: the popping and grinding in my right knee and hip joints whenever I stood up, bent down or took the stairs. The medical term for this is crepitus, yet I kept stubbornly persuading myself that I was still a “young” fiftysomething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I had imbibed the common positive ageing message: “50 is the new 30.” Yet as far as the cells that make up my knee and hip tendons and cartilage are concerned, 50 is still very much 50. So much for the popular idea that our overall “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/well/live/biological-age-testing.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;” can be far younger than our chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, I had done everything experts recommend – eat well, sleep well, exercise – and yet my doctor was still telling me it was time to adapt to my changing body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My physiatrist told me that many of his gen X patients, now in their late 40s and 50s, have bought into the idea that age shouldn’t be a factor when it comes to what exercise they do or how they do it. Each trendy sport or exercise sends a new wave of us into his office and others like it. For instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31796221/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly 91% of people showing up to the emergency room with injuries related to playing pickleball were over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many people approach their physical fitness as if they were a decade or two younger. My GP told me that patients over 50 are often frustrated by any suggestion that their routines might have to change. I started to see this denial of physical realities everywhere. One of my colleagues injured her shoulder doing CrossFit, then re-injured herself a few months later doing the same routine. A friend who has practiced yoga for decades fractured her chin in a fall from crow pose. When I suggested she modify her routine, she scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How do I stay healthy in my 50s, 60s and 70s?","elementId":"2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jul/23/how-stay-healthy-50s-60s-70s-ageing-tips-advice"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a medical anthropologist, I wondered: had anti-ageing messaging accidentally created a new problem? Was our generation at risk not from under-exercising, like the boomer and silent generations before us, but from over-exercising?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-our-bodies-change-as-we-age" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How our bodies change as we age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Finkelstein, a geriatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine, loves that people in their 40s, 50s and 60s have internalized that exercise is important for healthy ageing and longevity. That being said, there are some practical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our muscle mass and our performance peak in our mid-30s,” Finkelstein said, “and start to naturally decline after that. We do need to be flexible in terms of what we’re doing and expecting of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As we edge past 45, we begin to lose critical muscle mass, which can decrease our strength and balance. Decreases in bone density can leave us more vulnerable to stress fractures from repetitive motions and stress. The cartilage in our joints thin, while tendons and ligaments stiffen. All of this means we’re more prone to injuries during physical activity. Recovery takes longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The thing that people don’t know and don’t learn,” Dr Rosanne Leipzig said, “is that ageing begins at birth, and your abilities are definitely going to change.” Leipzig knows quite a lot about this process, both as a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and as someone in her 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You reach a maximum for your muscle mass, bone strength, ability to remember a list of words, all in your 30s. And everything starts to decline after that,” she said. “Ageing doesn’t mean that you can’t do what you did previously, but you probably can’t do as much in the same time period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most experts agreed that messages like “50 is the new 30” can be helpful if they convince people not to write themselves off as they age. It’s OK to push ourselves a bit physically. But the flip side is an assumption that a 50-year-old body isn’t different from a 30-year-old body. It is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable,” Finkelstein said. “We need to change our expectations and we need to change how we exercise as we get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-adapt-to-ageing-bodies-and-avoid-injury" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to adapt to ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing bodies and avoid injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In midlife, we should all learn to be more in tune with our bodies. That might mean taking more recovery time between intense workouts, doing more stretching and integrating more weights into our fitness routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A healthy adaptive approach to exercising as we age might involve regular self-monitoring and assessment of how our bodies feel both during and after workouts, and seeking input from a qualified medical professional when we start to notice any signs or symptoms of an encroaching problem, such as pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leipzig suggests that physicians begin conversations about adjustments by asking patients what it is they love about an activity they’re holding on to. A tennis player might really love the social aspect. In that case, they could switch to pickleball – which is less taxing, but similar – with a complementary strength-training and stretching regimen to prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But since risk of injury naturally rises as we age, it’s also important to have a backup plan for if and when we overdo it. When I talked to Dr Melissa Leber, associate professor of orthopedics and emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine, she had just finished working at the US Open. Leber has a lot of experience dealing with athletes – both professional and amateur – who have pushed themselves a bit too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Some people are really good at adjusting and they’re comfortable with their bodies changing,” Leber said. “Others go hardcore. I’ve seen some patients who don’t even want a day off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, if you’re a runner with an injury, try a modified strength-training routine and a lower-impact activity, like swimming. Then, when you start running again, run fewer times a week or for shorter distances. To avoid injury or overuse, experts recommend one or two rest days a week, at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strength training is also very important. “The stronger you are,” Leber said, “the more you will avoid injury and falls. And when you do fall, you will fall differently. Your balance will be better, and you’ll recover from injury faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a rule, Leber advises that someone in their 50s should spend 50% of their total exercise time on strength training and 50% doing cardio. By age 60, that metric should be 60% strength and 40% cardio. By 70, cardio should only comprise 30% of a workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of the experts I spoke to agree that pain should never be ignored – and it’s never a good idea to push through the pain without seeing your doctor. That being said, Finkelstein pointed out that most general physicians aren’t all that well-trained in exercise physiology. For specific recommendations pertaining to exercise regimens, it’s better to see a physiatrist, specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation or certified physical trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I wish we were all better trained in that,” Finkelstein said, “because it’s so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To compound this, conversations about how to maintain muscle mass, bone health, aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness take more time than the average physician can spend with their patients. Many people fill that gap with advice from fitness influencers online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cultivating-realistic-expectations-of-ageing" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating realistic expectations of ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Finkelstein worries about the effect of the media – especially social media, with its legions of wellness and anti-ageing influencers. “Take these supplements, do this exercise program, join this fitness routine: you name it, people are serving it up,” she said. “I worry a lot about that in terms of the reliability of those people and the science behind what they’re offering, and people being vulnerable to that because you want to do what you can to stay healthy and youthful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Popular media also loves to feature “superagers” – people whose mental and/or physical abilities are comparable to people 20-30 years younger. And while it’s good to see, say, an 87-year-old running a marathon, it may lead to false expectations about normal ageing. Superagers are rare; only about 10% of the general population fit all the criteria for inclusion in the category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting … that things are going to change&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, it’s not very realistic for those of us in our middle age or older to think we’ll rack up those personal bests forever. As the experts kept pointing out, the best approach to exercising as we age is realistic and adaptive. A runner who adapts to the changes of their ageing body and trains effectively may still be able to run the Boston marathon, but the time it takes for them to cross the finish line will necessarily lengthen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Part of the problem might be optimism bias. While we may logically understand that bodies change, we don’t think we are actually changing. Maybe that’s because we’re living in a culture that is obsessed not only with longevity, but with looking younger. The number of cosmetic procedures has &lt;a href="https://americanmedspa.org/news/isaps-releases-2024-global-survey-results-ranks-surgical-and-nonsurgical-procedure-popularity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased 42.5% globally&lt;/a&gt; over the last four years, and Americans spent an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/cosmetic-surgery-market" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$20bn on cosmetic surgery&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting the fact that things are going to change,” Leipzig said. “People are in better shape in general than they ever have been, if they’re privileged enough to be able to take care of their needs, but it leads them to think they will never die. It leads to ageism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And that’s the rub: being overly concerned with how much “younger” you are for your age is just another form of bias – one that you can hold against your future self. “Fifty is the new 30” simply underscores our misconception that being healthy means not ageing at all. It would be healthier if we occasionally reminded ourselves that ageing is a privilege; that “50 is 50” and “80 is 80” – and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOQWVTNzBBM215N2tUUUxmN2FKcDRKbXdDSzBibHZDU25QUnlacmRIMFlyN2hsMXVYMWM0SlphX09qNjhuS1BFSTQyRjc0ZGRMbGdEZFFJdlJYT0NJbnZyUlprQUZRZWFrSmw3Q3JmY2xhYlFxbEc0cVpoX2MyYmMzNEx5ZVB0cEhjUjZLTEpDRQ</guid></item><item><title>VEXAS综合征炎症和髓样偏倚的独立机制-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09815-0</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Abs1-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somatically acquired mutations in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were recently identified as the cause of the adult-onset autoinflammatory syndrome VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X linked, autoinflammatory, somatic)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in VEXAS lead to clonal expansion within the HSPC and myeloid, but not lymphoid, compartments. Despite its severity and prevalence, the mechanisms whereby &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause multiorgan autoinflammation and hematologic disease are unknown. Here, we employ somatic gene editing approaches to model VEXAS-associated &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in primary macrophages and HSPCs. &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt;-mutant macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli underwent aberrant apoptotic and necroptotic cell death mediated by Caspase-8 and RIPK3-MLKL, respectively. Accordingly, in mice challenged with TNF or LPS, the UBA1 inhibitor TAK-243 exacerbated inflammation in a RIPK3-Caspase-8-dependent manner. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt; mutation in HSPCs induced an unfolded protein response and myeloid bias independently of RIPK3-Caspase-8. Mechanistically, aberrant cell death of &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt;-mutant macrophages coincided with a kinetic defect in Lys63/Met1 (i.e., linear) polyubiquitylation of inflammatory signaling complexes. Collectively, our results link VEXAS pathogenesis with that of rarer monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes; highlight specific ubiquitin-associated defects stemming from an apical mutation in the ubiquitylation cascade; and support therapeutic targeting of the inflammatory cell death axis in VEXAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:45:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1qZ2Nicm5PR0NBSTNCZ185eEotYkZpZDdqeUo0MzJ4UU84Y1pNTHJGdUxtY0t6UmphSVloUTl6dzVvVjBvMTZ5VlNkQWc3SUpQOUhjdHNDemtNWUx4N0Nj</guid></item><item><title>新的研究将褪黑激素与心力衰竭联系起来，但专家表示不要惊慌失措-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/03/melatonin-heart-failure-sleep-aid/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ILAJW3UZBCKRJD6OQXSXDLR7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A study that reviewed health records for tens of thousands of adults with chronic insomnia found that people who took prescribed melatonin for more than a year had a higher chance of heart failure over five years compared with people who were identified as nonusers, the American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/long-term-use-of-melatonin-supplements-to-support-sleep-may-have-negative-health-effects?preview=6f74&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" target="_blank"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.

It is considered extremely rare, with its true incidence unknown because it is often misdiagnosed or overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This doesn't just trick a breathalyzer. Fermenting yeast, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11354181/Fatal-fungi-releases-list-dangerous-fungal-pathogens-growing-threat.html"&gt;typically Candida albicans&lt;/a&gt;, creates real alcohol in the bloodstream, leading to the same stumbling, slurring and mental impairment as if Jane had been drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-ad7bf510-b42f-11f0-8154-a97bfc676553"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; immunologist who works with ABS patients, told the Daily Mail: 'It's quite powerful to have somebody that literally didn't take a drink of alcohol and is failing a breathalyzer test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell pointed to a clear pattern in his auto-brewery syndrome patients. Every single one had recently taken antibiotics, which are known to disrupt the gut's natural balance of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;After taking antibiotics and acid reflux medicine, teacher and mother Jane began fermenting carbs into alcohol in her gut. This condition caused her to fail breathalyzer tests twice while completely sober (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics wipe out both harmful and beneficial gut bacteria, creating a void that allows Candida yeast to proliferate unchecked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, after grabbing a cupcake to eat on her way home, a quick burst of sugar to carry her through dinner time, Jane soon felt bloated in her stomach and her concentration had become cloudy. Before she knew it, she had run a red light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A police officer pulled her over, suspecting she was drunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her denial, a breathalyzer test confirmed his suspicion, leading to a citation and a court summons for a DUI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a second, equally baffling incident in which a police officer pulled her over, she was desperate for a medical explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It would be weeks before Jane’s doctor could issue and explain the diagnosis, auto-brewery syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A specific yeast in her gut, Candida, was fermenting the carbohydrates in her food, effectively brewing alcohol inside her own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it all may have stemmed from antibiotic use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Once she was diagnosed with ABS, Jane finally had an explanation for her crippling fatigue, her brain fog and slurred speech, especially after eating carb-heavy foods (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent New York City immunologist, told the Daily Mail that nearly all of his patients with Candida overgrowth have a history of long-term antibiotic use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell told the Daily Mail that widespread over-prescription of antibiotics ‘is a little bit heartbreaking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘I see a lot of young people who've been on tetracycline for six months for acne, or I see people for chronic Lyme disease, the chronic sinus and bronchitis patients and the urinary tract patients. I'm not a believer that long-term antibiotics help those patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients journey to his New York City clinic reporting the same core symptoms: stubborn fatigue, brain fog, and bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For some, this progresses to full-scale intoxication, including dizziness, slurred speech, and blood alcohol levels sufficient to fail a breathalyzer test despite complete sobriety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He first rules out conditions like anemia. If standard tests are normal and the patient has a history of triggers like antibiotics or acid blockers, he uses a 15-questionnaire to help confirm a diagnosis of Candida overgrowth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He categorizes the condition into four stages. It typically begins with digestive issues like bloating after high-carb meals, then progresses to localized problems such as chronic sinusitis, vaginitis and unexplained rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell said: ‘Patients that I would see with chronic sinusitis and sometimes the other symptoms, like the GI symptoms, they're like, oh my god, I’ve seen an [ear, nose and throat doctor] for two years. He keeps on giving me antibiotics, he gives me steroids and I've had two operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then all of a sudden, I treat them for the Candida overgrowth and their sinuses get better and their fatigue gets better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Candida albicans, the yeast that causes ABS, is now a WHO "priority pathogen" because of its drug resistance. Though normally harmless in the gut, it becomes dangerous in immunocompromised individuals &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third stage involves debilitating neurological symptoms, such as severe brain fog that can be so intense that patients have had to leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell added: ‘I have these 20-year-olds say, ‘I have to leave my job. I'm working in finance and I can't do the rigors of what I need to do,’ and I work with them and they get better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most severe stage encompasses systemic illness, including profound chronic fatigue and body-wide pain similar to fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell's treatment begins with antifungal medication and a strict 30-day, low-carb diet to starve the yeast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then repairs the gut using targeted vitamins and nutrients to reduce inflammation and repopulate the microbiome with beneficial bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And in similar individuals who walk further, taking 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day, decline slows by an average of 7 years. The work also offers hints to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;how exercise alters the brain&lt;/a&gt; to offer this protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The very encouraging takeaway is that even a little bit of exercise seems to help,” says Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, a physician-scientist specializing in memory disorders at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and a co-author of the study, which was published on 3 November in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. The research indicates that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03513-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03513-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people don’t need to take 10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt;, a goal that is often touted but might be hard for some older individuals to attain, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steps towards prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team ran regular checks on 296 people participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a programme that is investigating the early stages of Alzheimer’s. None of them had signs of cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Over a period of up to 14 years, the team periodically assessed the participants — whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 — using cognitive tests and brain scans. Participants were also asked to wear pedometers to measure how many steps they took each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of people at a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease usually show an abnormal build-up of two proteins: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;amyloid-β and tau&lt;/a&gt;. Although the relationship between the two proteins is not fully understood, amyloid-β levels begin to increase first, followed by tau levels. Cognitive decline seems to be more closely tied to the accumulation of tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of taking 3,000 to 7,500 steps per day were apparent only for participants with high baseline levels of amyloid-β in their brains. Their mental decline was slowed — by 3 to 7 years — compared with participants who were sedentary. The researchers didn’t see any further slowing of mental decline in participants who took more than 7,500 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A large study from Massachusetts found that &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/9900/neurodevelopmental_outcomes_of_3_year_old_children.1392.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;babies whose mothers had COVID-19 while pregnant&lt;/a&gt; were slightly more likely to have a range of neurodevelopmental diagnoses by age 3. Most of these children had speech or motor delays, and the link was strongest when the mother was infected late in pregnancy and in boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in risk was small for any one child, but because millions of women were pregnant during the pandemic, even a small increase matters. The study doesn't prove that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes autism or other brain conditions in the fetus, but it suggests that infections and inflammation during pregnancy can affect how a baby's brain grows, something scientists have seen before with other illnesses. It's reason to help pregnant women avoid COVID-19 and to keep a close eye on children who were exposed in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital examined medical records from more than 18,000 mothers and their children born between March 2020 and May 2021, before vaccines were widely available. Because everyone giving birth during that period was tested for COVID, the team could clearly see which pregnancies were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5% of those mothers had COVID while pregnant. Their children were modestly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition by age 3 than those whose mothers weren't infected, even after accounting for differences in maternal age, race, insurance status, and preterm birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link appeared strongest when infection occurred in the third trimester and among boys. Still, the vast majority of children in both groups showed typical development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was a very clean group to follow," said Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General and one of the study's authors. "Because of universal testing early in the pandemic, we knew who had COVID and who didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say COVID, which causes a powerful immune response in some people, fits the biological pattern seen with other infections in pregnancy. Dr. Alan Brown, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University, who studies maternal infection and brain development, explained, "COVID would be a very strong candidate for it to happen because the amount of inflammation is very extreme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How might infection affect brain development?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still piecing together how various types of infections in pregnancy affect fetal development. Severe illness can cause inflammation that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3978" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disrupts brain growth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1307582110" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;trigger preterm birth&lt;/a&gt;, which carries its own risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a long history of evidence showing that maternal infection can slightly raise the risk for many neurodevelopmental disorders," said Dr. Roy Perlis, the vice chair for research in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edlow's lab is investigating how infection and inflammation may interfere with brain development. In a healthy brain, immune cells help shape developing neural circuits by trimming away extra or unnecessary connections, a process known as "synaptic pruning," which sculpts the brain's wiring. When a mother's immune system is activated by infection, inflammatory molecules can reach the fetal brain and alter the pruning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag3194" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; support Edlow's hypothesis. When scientists trigger inflammation in pregnant mice, their offspring often show changes in how brain cells grow and connect, changes that can alter learning and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why late pregnancy and why boys?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Edlow and Perlis' study, the link between COVID and developmental delays was strongest when infection occurred late in pregnancy, during the third trimester. That's also when the fetal brain is growing most rapidly, forming and refining millions of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we think of organ development, we think earlier in pregnancy, but the brain is an exception in this regard, where there's a massive amount of brain development in the third trimester. And that continues after birth," said Perlis. "It is entirely plausible that the third trimester is a period of vulnerability specifically for brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone agrees the third trimester is uniquely vulnerable. Dr. Brian Lee, a professor of epidemiology at Drexel University, cautioned that because most mothers in the study were tested at delivery, there were simply more late-pregnancy infections to analyze. "That gives the study more power to find a difference in the third trimester," he said. "It doesn't prove earlier infections aren't important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found stronger effects in boys. That pattern is familiar: boys are generally more likely than girls to have speech or motor delays and to be diagnosed with autism. Researchers suspect that male fetuses may be more sensitive to stress and inflammation before birth, though the biology isn't fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study can and can't show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow and Perlis are careful to say the study shows an association, not proof that COVID infection in pregnancy causes developmental problems. &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(22)00264-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Many other factors&lt;/a&gt; could explain the link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mothers who get sick with COVID may also have other health issues, like obesity, diabetes or mental health conditions, that increase the risk of developmental delays in children. "Persons with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20806" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mental disorders&lt;/a&gt; are much more likely to get COVID. Women with mental disorders are much &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536042/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more likely to have kids with neurodevelopmental problems&lt;/a&gt;," Lee said. "Mothers with &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;worse physical health&lt;/a&gt; are also at higher risk of having children with neurodevelopmental problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee's research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159114004528?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;even infections before or after pregnancy can be linked to autism&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that shared genetics or environment, rather than the infection itself, could be at play. That's why experts say much larger, longer studies are needed to understand the extent of any risk from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow, Perlis and their team plan to follow the children in their study as they grow older to see whether early differences persist or fade. They're also studying how inflammation during pregnancy affects the placenta and fetal brain, and how to counteract those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this study followed pregnancies from early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available, it doesn't answer whether vaccination changes the risk. But other research offers reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large national study in Scotland &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352464225000082" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found no difference in early developmental outcomes&lt;/a&gt; between children whose mothers were vaccinated and those who weren't. Another study in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2814106" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found the same&lt;/a&gt;: no link between prenatal COVID vaccination and developmental delays through 18 months. Both align with decades of data showing that vaccination during pregnancy is safe for both the mother and the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is a short spike… your immune system revs up, then it goes back to normal," said Edlow. "COVID [infection] is much more prolonged, unpredictable, and people can get… a dysregulated immune phenomenon that really doesn't exist in vaccine responses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for parents and clinicians&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since late 2020, there's been widespread confusion and misinformation about the safety of COVID vaccination during pregnancy. Some women have hesitated to get vaccinated out of fear it might harm their baby. But the evidence since then has been clear: the COVID vaccine is safe in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;strongly recommends COVID vaccination&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-protects-newborn-babies-cdc-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;both mother and child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the broader lesson is that pregnancy is a period of vulnerability, and prevention matters, not only &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-study-unvaccinated-pregnant-women-stillbirth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;for COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but other infections as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Janet Currie, a professor of economics at Yale University, said these risks remain "underappreciated," despite decades of evidence. "Even though the flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, very few pregnant women get it," she said. "Physicians seem to be reluctant to vaccinate pregnant women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Gil Mor, scientific director of the C.S. Mott Center for Human Growth and Development at Wayne State University, put it, "Protecting the mother is protecting the long-term health of the offspring. … The best intervention is vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A century-old echo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that what happens in the womb can shape life after birth began with studies of famine, like the Dutch Hunger Winter in the final months of World War II. Between 1944 and 1945, as German forces blockaded the western Netherlands, rations fell to just a few hundred calories a day. Thousands died of starvation, and women who were pregnant during that period gave birth to babies who later faced higher risks of &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/84/6/595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)07244-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/495981" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. The episode became a cornerstone of the "&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)90710-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fetal origins&lt;/a&gt;" idea, that deprivation or stress in pregnancy can have lifelong effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.25.3.153" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1918 flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; broadened that idea to infection. Babies exposed to influenza in utero later showed small but lasting &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/507154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;differences in education and earnings&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first signs that illness during pregnancy could affect brain development. Research in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997382/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2727135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953611006368" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691044/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28371628/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; found similar impacts. Some argued that those findings reflected the &lt;a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disruptions of World War I&lt;/a&gt;, not the flu itself. But &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;later studies&lt;/a&gt;, including those from the &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41304838" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/494237" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, have strengthened the case for a biological effect, reinforcing that the infection itself, not wartime upheaval, was the key driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't simply influenza that can alter fetal neurodevelopment," Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UW Medicine, explained. "Many types of infections… in the mother can be transmitted as a signal to the fetus, which can alter its brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century later, the same question has returned with COVID: could infection during pregnancy subtly shape how children grow and learn? The new Massachusetts General Hospital study offers an early look at the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

The research indicates that using playful or childish terms for genitals in everyday life is linked to more negative outcomes, while using vulgar terms during sex is connected to more positive sexual experiences. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-025-01619-w" target="_blank"&gt;Sex Roles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many scholars and educators believe language shapes our body image, this idea has rarely been put to the test. A team of researchers led by Tanja Oschatz of Johannes-Gutenberg-University and Rotem Kahalon of Bar-Ilan University aimed to provide the missing scientific evidence, particularly regarding the terms women use for their genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years, both feminist scholars and sex educators have emphasized that language matters—that the words we use to talk about our bodies can shape how we feel about them. Yet, despite this widely accepted idea, there was surprisingly little empirical evidence showing how this plays out with regards to women’s genitals,” Oschatz told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although there were studies from 20 year ago that catalogued the many terms women use to describe their genitals, no one had examined whether using different terms is actually linked to women’s feelings, attitudes, or behaviors. Our first goal was to close this gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Secondly, we wanted to update previous findings on women’s genital naming. Language is constantly evolving—especially around gender, sexuality, and the body. What women call their genitals today may carry different meanings and social implications than it did two decades ago, and we wanted to capture this contemporary picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their study, the researchers surveyed 457 women from the United States with diverse ages. Participants were asked what terms they most commonly use to refer to their genitals in two different scenarios: a general, non-sexual context and a partnered, sexual context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women also completed a series of questionnaires designed to measure their feelings and attitudes. These included scales assessing their genital self-image, their overall sexual pleasure, orgasm frequency, attitudes toward oral sex, and certain health-related behaviors, such as the use of vaginal cleaning products and their openness to labiaplasty, a type of cosmetic genital surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After collecting the terms, the researchers performed a content analysis and grouped the words into nine distinct categories. These categories included anatomical (e.g., “vagina,” “vulva”), vulgar (e.g., “pussy”), playful/childish (e.g., “hoo-ha,” “vajayjay”), and euphemisms (e.g., “down there,” “private parts”), among others. The team then used statistical analyses to see if using terms from a particular category was associated with the participants’ self-reported attitudes and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, non-sexual contexts, the study found that a majority of women, about 75%, reported using at least one anatomical term, with “vagina” being the most frequent. However, playful/childish terms and euphemisms were also common, each used by roughly 15% of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that genital naming among women is very diverse—and that it depends strongly on the context,” Oschatz explained. “For example, when women were asked, ‘What term do you generally use?’, the majority mentioned at least one anatomical term such as ‘vagina’ or ‘vulva.’ In contrast, when asked what term they use in a sexual context, most women reported using more informal or vulgar terms like ‘pussy.’ Compared to data from twenty years ago, we also found that the term ‘vulva’ (referring to the outer parts of women’s genitals) and words referring to the clitoris have become more common, suggesting a more differentiated and anatomically informed vocabulary today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that women who used playful/childish terms tended to report a more negative genital self-image. This connection appeared to extend to other areas as well. The use of these terms was also linked to a lower perception of a partner’s enjoyment of giving oral sex, a greater likelihood of using vaginal cleaning products, and a higher interest in getting labiaplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a more negative genital self-image helped explain the connection between using playful terms and the greater openness to labiaplasty, as well as the lower perceived partner enjoyment of oral sex. This suggests that the negative feelings women have about their genitals may be a key factor driving these other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that the words women use are indeed related to their attitudes and experiences,” Oschatz told PsyPost. “Women who used childish terms such as ‘hoo-ha’ or ‘vajayjay’ tended to report more negative feelings about their genitals. These terms were also linked to sexual and health behaviors and attitudes—such as a more negative perception of partner’s oral sex enjoyment, greater use of vaginal cleaning products, and higher openness to labiaplasty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed the terms women used in a sexual context with a partner, the linguistic landscape changed significantly. In this setting, the most common category was vulgar terms, with nearly 45% of women reporting their use. The most frequent word in this category was “pussy.” Anatomical terms were the second most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that using vulgar terms during sex was associated with positive sexual outcomes. Women who used these terms reported experiencing greater general sexual pleasure, more frequent orgasms, and a stronger desire to receive oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Context really matters,” Oschatz emphasized. “The associations between language and attitudes differed depending on when the terms were used. For instance, childish terms were linked to more negative feelings only when used in non-sexual contexts, but not during sexual ones. Interestingly, using the word ‘pussy’ in sexual contexts was associated with greater sexual pleasure and more frequent orgasms. This suggests that a word once considered derogatory may now be reclaimed by many women and carry an element of empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what researchers expected, the use of euphemisms was not associated with a negative genital self-image or any other adverse outcomes in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that using euphemisms—vague and indirect terms like ‘own there’ or ‘private area’—was not associated with more negative attitudes toward women’s own genitals,” Oschatz said. “We had expected that these terms might carry an element of shame or discomfort, which could be linked to a more negative genital self-image. However, our findings suggest otherwise. Instead, it was really the use of childish language that was related to negative feelings and attitudes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study has some limitations. The participants were predominantly white and highly educated, so the findings may not apply to women from other racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds where language and cultural norms may differ. The research was also focused exclusively on cisgender women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because the study shows a correlation, it cannot determine causation. It is unclear if using certain words influences a woman’s feelings and behaviors, or if her existing feelings and behaviors influence her choice of words. It is also possible that the relationship works in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these dynamics in more diverse populations and use methods that help establish the direction of the relationship over time. Researchers also suggest a deeper exploration into the complex nature of reclaimed terms to better understand how and when they contribute to a sense of genuine empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors note that the findings have practical implications, particularly for health and education. Discouraging infantilizing language and promoting the use of accurate anatomical terms in medical, educational, and family settings could help reduce shame and improve body literacy and well-being among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-025-01619-w" target="_blank"&gt;Vagina, Pussy, Vulva, Vag – Women’s Names for Their Genitals are Differentially Associated with Sexual and Health Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tanja Oschatz, Verena Klein, Veronica Kovalcik, and Rotem Kahalon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:07:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNRkc0MlcybVd6bmduYmRQeFREUC1LYzFJbUhpbGd1UXJUYWZfOUc3eWxqbURVTG9rOGdBaV8waWF6b3dIbTBWelZKaTFZV2tBaUhtRC1jR0g0T0F5MFhEbGxQUks1R3Q1cXBoZG1OSDduR3BTSUxaZlZqdWFselZiVVFTSlVsUmZyc2JwOGFSRGkyQXktNzAtWVVGdkRnelhuOG5MOEI3M0J3VmgzcU80ZA</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现，人类的心脏可以自我修复-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/11/03/human-heart-fix-itself-icahn-school-of-medicine-mount-sinai/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;When someone has a heart attack or heart failure, heart muscle cells are lost and the heart cannot replace them and there is no current way to grow new heart muscle cells after damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one million people in Britain are living with heart failure, with around 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year and the only options are medications to help manage symptoms, stents, valve repairs, heart bypass or a transplant. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/heart-disease/"&gt;Heart diseases&lt;/a&gt; are currently the second-largest cause of death in Britain each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new technique harnesses the power of a naturally-occurring gene called Cyclin A2 or, CCNA2, which plays a critical role in cell division and growth during foetal development but ceases activity shortly after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reactivating this gene enables the production of new cardiomyocytes – heart muscle cells – which can repair damaged areas of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team inserted the gene into a harmless virus and tested it directly in living adult human heart cells in culture from 41 and 55-year-old hearts. They used time-lapse imaging to analyse the heart cells with CCNA2 and saw that they began to divide successfully, keeping their structure and function and demonstrating normal protein and calcium activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that CCNA2 helps heart cells “turn back the clock” by reactivating growth genes so they can divide and repair the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chaudhry said: “This is the culmination of nearly two decades of work. We pioneered the concept that the heart could be regenerated by reawakening dormant cell division genes, and now we’ve brought that vision one step closer to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to deliver a therapy that allows the heart to heal itself after a heart attack or in heart failure, reducing the need for transplants or mechanical devices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are now seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials of CCNA2 therapy in patients with heart disease. The research was published in the journal Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

Because energy needs change continuously, mitochondria must constantly fine-tune their activity to keep up. This adaptability depends in part on the nutrients available to the cell. Yet until recently, scientists did not fully understand how nutrients influence this process of energy adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research group led by Professor Dr. Thorsten Hoppe at the University of Cologne's Institute for Genetics and the CECAD Cluster of Excellence on Aging Research has now identified a new biological pathway showing how the amino acid leucine strengthens mitochondrial performance. Their work reveals that leucine stabilizes important mitochondrial proteins, enhancing the organelle's ability to produce energy. The study, titled "Leucine inhibits degradation of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to adapt mitochondrial respiration," was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Leucine Supports Energy Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine is one of the essential amino acids, meaning it must be obtained through food. It is a key component of protein synthesis and is abundant in protein-rich foods like meat, dairy products, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The researchers found that leucine helps protect certain proteins on the outer membrane of mitochondria from breaking down. These proteins are vital because they transport other metabolic molecules into the mitochondria to generate energy. By preserving them, leucine allows mitochondria to work more efficiently, resulting in higher energy output within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were thrilled to discover that a cell's nutrient status, especially its leucine levels, directly impacts energy production," said Dr. Qiaochu Li, the study's first author. "This mechanism enables cells to swiftly adapt to increased energy demands during periods of nutrient abundance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that a protein called SEL1L plays an important role in this process. SEL1L is part of the cell's quality control system that identifies and removes faulty or misfolded proteins. Leucine seems to reduce the activity of SEL1L, which decreases the breakdown of mitochondrial proteins and improves mitochondrial performance. "Modulating leucine and SEL1L levels could be a strategy to boost energy production," said Li. "However, it is important to proceed with caution. SEL1L also plays a crucial role in preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins, which is essential for long-term cellular health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications for Health and Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the wider impact of their findings, the researchers studied the process in the model organism &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;. They discovered that problems in leucine metabolism can impair mitochondrial function and even cause fertility issues. When the team examined human lung cancer cells, they found that certain mutations affecting leucine metabolism actually help cancer cells survive, highlighting an important factor for future cancer treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These discoveries show that the nutrients we consume do more than simply fuel the body -- they actively influence how energy is produced inside cells. By uncovering how leucine affects mitochondrial metabolism, the study points to potential new therapeutic targets for conditions linked to reduced energy production, including cancer and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research received support through Germany's Excellence Strategy as part of CECAD and from several Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Additional funding came from the European Research Council via the ERC Advanced Grant "Cellular Strategies of Protein Quality Control-Degradation" (CellularPQCD) and from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Equids, members of the horse family including horses, donkeys and zebras, share curious features called chestnuts. Found on every horse, they appear as toughened growths on their limbs, and can be clipped back if they grow too large. Anyone following the charming and rugged farrier Sam Wolfenden on TikTok will have seen his expert chestnut clipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chestnuts are fascinating little entities – &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41012771/"&gt;remnants of toe pads&lt;/a&gt; that were present in the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/prehistoric-520"&gt;prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; relatives of both domestic and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/wild-horses-44720"&gt;wild horses&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also unique to each animal; you can think of them as an individual fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chestnuts are made of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079642515000596"&gt;keratin&lt;/a&gt;, the same material found in the outer layer of skin. It’s protective, waterproof and durable, giving resilience and strength. It’s also found in hair and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-your-nails-can-tell-you-about-your-health-232687"&gt;nails&lt;/a&gt;, which allow for important functions like trapping heat and providing sensory information to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Samuel Wolfenden is a farrier who often shares social media posts of chestnut removals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hooves and horns of animals are no different. Keratin-based and developed from the skin, they are designed for functions such as protection or even as weapons in battle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keratin therefore plays an important role across both human and animal species. And since we’re all built from similar biological materials, it may not surprise you that humans can develop horns too – though not quite like a horse or goat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Human horns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-guidance/cutaneous-horn"&gt;Cutaneous horns&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;cornu cutaneum&lt;/em&gt;, are compacted keratin masses that grow outward from a person’s skin. Their typically curved shape and hardened texture make them look like the horns of a goat, sheep or cow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can vary in colour from yellow to brown to grey. Their relative shade depends on the amount of pigment and dead cells trapped within the keratin as it builds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous horns develop from skin lesions of various kinds, and many are harmless. Several common benign lesions such as &lt;a href="https://patient.info/skin-conditions/warts-and-verrucas-leaflet/seborrhoeic-warts"&gt;seborrhoeic keratoses&lt;/a&gt; – warty swellings extremely common in older people – can develop into these “horns”. So can other warts, including those caused by the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/hpv-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-common-virus-linked-to-cancer-263678"&gt;human papilloma virus (HPV)&lt;/a&gt;, a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes and can lead to either warts or, in rarer cases, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39896306/"&gt;16-20%&lt;/a&gt; of cutaneous horns are malignant, developing from skin cancers such as &lt;a href="https://www.kingstonandrichmond.nhs.uk/patients-and-families/patient-leaflets/squamous-cell-carcinoma-scc"&gt;squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. This form of cancer starts in the outer layer of the skin and can invade deeper tissues if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others arise from premalignant conditions: skin changes that have not yet become cancerous but have the potential to do so. A prime example is an &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/actinic-keratoses/"&gt;actinic (or solar) keratosis&lt;/a&gt;, which can later develop into squamous cell cancer, sometimes forming a horn but often not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the cells within the lesion become denatured, losing their normal structure and function. This uncontrolled growth can lead to excessive keratin production, occasionally resulting in the formation of a horn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who develop cutaneous horns, whether benign, premalignant or cancerous, tend to share some &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cutaneous-horn"&gt;similar risk factors&lt;/a&gt;. These horns are far more common in older adults and in those with fair skin, and they often appear on sun-exposed areas such as the head or face, suggesting that ultraviolet (UV) light plays a major role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun damage is a key cause of all skin cancers including &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/melanoma-skin-cancer/"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;, the most dangerous form. Unlike squamous cell cancer, melanoma originates in pigment-producing cells and spreads more aggressively through the body if not caught early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Grow to astonishing sizes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cutaneous horns appear in stranger places, including the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11719372/"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40896729/"&gt;genitals&lt;/a&gt;. And because they can sometimes be linked to cancer, anyone who notices one should see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their appearance can be distressing, especially when they form on visible areas like the face, and they may also cause discomfort or irritation. &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-horn"&gt;Treatment&lt;/a&gt; usually involves surgical removal of the horn and a small amount of surrounding skin, a procedure known as excision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cutaneous horns can grow to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36742859/"&gt;astonishing sizes&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, an elderly woman in China made headlines because of a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/107-year-old-chinese-grandmas-devil-horn-credited-for-her-long-life/"&gt;large cutaneous horn&lt;/a&gt; that grew from her forehead, reaching ten centimetres over seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have earned nicknames like “unicorn horns” when they sprout from the centre of a person’s forehead. Alternatively, &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7473687/Indian-man-74-four-inch-devil-horn-removed-head.html"&gt;a patient in India&lt;/a&gt; was reported to have a “devil’s horn” growing from the top of his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the record for the biggest cutaneous horn probably &lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/114789-longest-human-horn"&gt;belongs to Madame Dimanche&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Widow Sunday, in the early 19th century. This French woman’s horn stretched nearly 25cm, hanging past her chin before it was removed. A wax cast of both her face and the horn are now displayed among other anatomical curiosities in the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever notice a hard, growing bump that looks even faintly horn-like, don’t wait. Get it checked by your GP in order to guide the most appropriate treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caffeine and sugar-spiked energy drinks promise a quick pick-me-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet experts say that frequently consuming these drinks could be harming your liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you need a little extra energy, try a cup of unsweetened coffee or tea instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching for a caffeinated drink can help kickstart your day or power you through an afternoon slump. In fact, 90% of us consume caffeine on a daily basis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But if you usually get your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061814/are-energy-drinks-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine kick from an energy drink&lt;/a&gt;, it could spell trouble for your liver health. “Energy drinks are defined as over-the-counter commercial beverages with high caffeine content that are advertised to boost energy, including mental alertness and physical performance,” says &lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;  While they may seem like harmless, fizzy alternatives to coffee, they affect your body–and your liver–very differently than the average cup of joe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to find out what the experts have to say about energy drinks and your liver health, plus their suggestions for healthier alternatives to keep you energized. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-energy-drinks-may-be-harming-your-liver"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Energy Drinks May Be Harming Your Liver &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can Deliver Lots of Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine is a natural stimulant that can help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-for-more-energy-today-11770029" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;feel more energized and alert&lt;/a&gt;. But you can have too much of a good thing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that adults consume no more than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;400 milligrams of caffeine per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A 12-ounce energy drink can contain anywhere from 40 mg of caffeine on the low end, to 250 mg on the high end (and 16-ounce cans may pack even more). So, if you down a couple of cans a day, you could be consuming &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-sources-of-caffeine-8647888" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;unhealthy amounts of caffeine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What does all of this mean for your liver? As your body’s primary detoxification system, your liver has to process that flood of caffeine. While the occasional energy drink isn’t likely to cause liver problems, regularly drinking large amounts of highly caffeinated ones could lead to liver injury over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Coffee, by comparison, has been linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-liver-health-11800733" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better liver health&lt;/a&gt;, most likely due to its more than 1,000 bioactive compounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To complicate matters, energy drinks can be marketed as supplements. When they are, they aren’t required by law to list their caffeine on the Nutrition Facts panel. That means you could be getting a lot more caffeine than you bargained for.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can be Packed with Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It doesn’t help that energy drinks are super-sweet, says &lt;a href="http://gooseberry-health.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Isabel Balady, RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike naturally bitter coffee or tea, it’s easy to guzzle a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/102230/shocking-levels-of-sugar-in-8-popular-beverages/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sugary-sweet energy drink&lt;/a&gt; just like soda. Those sugars may be great for providing an initial rush of energy. But it’s usually short-lived and can leave you feeling drained later on. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since your liver is responsible for ensuring that your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar levels remain steady&lt;/a&gt;, consuming too much added sugar day after day can adversely impact your liver health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research has found that regularly drinking sugar-sweetened beverages–like energy drinks–can cause fat to build up in the liver. This may lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/having-diabetes-can-increase-your-risk-of-liver-disease-heres-what-you-can-do-to-help-8399481" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nonalcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; (NAFLD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Over time, this can impair liver function and cause inflammation,” explains &lt;a href="http://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske, M.S., LN, CNS&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much sugar are we talking about? Some energy drinks pack 54 to 62 grams of sugar per 16-ounce can. To put that into perspective, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting added sugar to no more than 10% of daily calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s roughly 12 teaspoons (or 50 grams) of added sugar for someone who eats about 2,000 calories a day. So, should you be reaching for a sugar-free energy drink instead? While these may seem like a healthier choice, there’s new evidence that even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-surprising-drink-that-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-disease-11705434" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;artificially-sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt; may raise your odds of liver disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can Contain Harmful Doses of Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy drinks often contain a cocktail of supplemental ingredients like vitamins and minerals, as well as herbs like guarana and ginkgo biloba. These ingredients are often marketed as “natural,”  which makes them seem wholesome. But it’s your liver's job to process them all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One seemingly innocent ingredient commonly added to energy drinks is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, B vitamins play an active role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291451/will-vitamin-b12-give-me-energy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. However, energy drinks often contain considerably more than we really need, even to the point that they may be harmful to your liver. For example, niacin is an important B vitamin, but too much of it can potentially lead to liver toxicity. Some research has even linked high-niacin energy drinks to the development of hepatitis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthier-alternatives"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Healthier Alternatives &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The occasional energy drink is OK for most healthy people. However, if you’re frequently relying on their higher wattage to keep you awake and alert, it may be time to find a healthier alternative, like one of these: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee:&lt;/strong&gt; Many people love the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine boost of a cup of joe&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee also happens to be packed with loads of health-promoting compounds. Some of these may actually lower the risk of liver disease when consumed in moderate amounts, says Balady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea: &lt;/strong&gt;While green and black tea have less caffeine than coffee, they contain an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866840/foods-to-eat-to-stay-energized/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;energy-boosting amino acid&lt;/a&gt; called L-theanine. This amino acid has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7907172/what-are-nootropics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;promote attention and focus&lt;/a&gt;, without the jitters of caffeine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water: &lt;/strong&gt;Being dehydrated can leave you sluggish. Instead of reaching for caffeine, try a glass of water first. If plain water is a turn-off, Vaske recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-ingredient-to-upgrade-your-water-fruit-11783370" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;water infused with a little fruit&lt;/a&gt; to support hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Fat Milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Sure, milk doesn’t contain caffeine. But that doesn’t mean it can’t give you a bit of the energy you’re looking for. Thanks to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-electrolytes-8645417" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;electrolytes, like potassium&lt;/a&gt;, milk is an excellent choice for fending off dehydration. Plus, its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;natural sugars&lt;/a&gt; can boost energy levels while its protein helps sustain them for longer. A winning combo if you ask us! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Marketed as energy in a bottle with enticing flavors like “Watermelon Wave”, “Sherbet Swirl” or “Punched Hardcore Apple,” it’s no wonder energy drinks are skyrocketing in popularity. While they may seem like innocent alternatives to coffee, experts warn that their combination of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-drink-too-much-coffee-in-the-am-11758446" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, added sugars and supplemental ingredients can pose potential health risks for your liver. While the occasional quick fix of an energy drink is OK for most of us, making them your go-to could spell trouble for your health, especially your liver. Next time you need a kick, grab a cup of unsweetened coffee or tea. They’re loaded with compounds that protect your liver and are likely lower in caffeine than most energy drinks. Plus, they’re naturally sugar-free. No matter which drink you choose for energy, don’t forget the basics, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, adequate hydration and plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy, whole foods&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll keep your energy levels up in the long run, far better than any drink can.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1FVU4wVXlSdTJHdVl3Q08zTTYzT2VZTXZBYkZWYjZBbWtNSzJGVjU2bWNoTkJwNWlJdzhmZHBNY1BtYXAxQW1RaE1ZdnBUM2RDZVZYenZGODY5VXV3cDUwRUZITUVZWkRzOUQ1OHl1dDFCb1Q2YmRjbDFiVEY5QQ</guid></item><item><title>健康影响者依赖垃圾科学- UnHerd</title><link>https://unherd.com/newsroom/wellness-influencers-are-relying-on-junk-science/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pianocontentwrapper"&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;There’s a new kind of health revolution happening online. Forget rushed GP appointments and overbooked clinics — today’s health experts are wellness gurus who wear yoga pants, talk cortisol levels, and sell empowerment. Last week, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/birth-control-hormone-health-78f15942?mod=hp_lead_pos10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the latest outlet to show how “hormone balance” and “wellness” have become both diagnosis and cure, promising that better sleep, clearer skin and calmer moods can be achieved through supplements and an unwavering commitment to this new lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before people dismiss this movement, it’s important to remember that beneath the soft lighting and wellness tonics lies a harder truth — a growing number of women have justifiably lost faith in medicine. They’re tired of being misunderstood, overprescribed, or told that their problems are “just hormones”. And into that space has swept the wellness industry — part rebellion, part exploitation of women’s worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s little wonder that many women are looking elsewhere for answers, not from experts in white coats, but from each other. Former athlete and registered nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatthemenopause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jessica Barac&lt;/a&gt; was hit with crippling anxiety, extreme fatigue, and sudden crying jags during an unexpected perimenopause in her late 30s. Unimpressed by the information available, she began sharing her experiences of the non-medicalised wellness industry online. Now, more than a million people follow her advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories like hers explain why the wellness economy has exploded. Wellness isn’t a medical revolution so much as a beautifully branded rebellion. The dull, sensible advice of your harried GP — sleep well, eat healthily, exercise often — has been replaced by glossy promises of health and happiness through supplements and tonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wellness industry has extended far beyond vitamins and minerals. Los Angeles photographer Masha Maltsava has cleared her home of “forever chemicals”, swapped her cookware for cast iron, and banished her polyester leggings. She now tracks her stress levels with an Oura ring and uses AI to interpret her lab results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But herein lies the problem with relying on the wellness industry. What began as a justifiable search for better information has morphed into a multi-million-pound industry. This is where “first, do no harm” collides with “buyer beware”. The tragedy is that women aren’t wrong to seek better or non-pharmaceutical care for certain ailments — the worry is that they’re being sold certainty in place of science. It’s easy to mock those who turn to influencers instead of doctors, but in a world that demands answers, someone will always be waiting to sell you one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take 28-year-old content creator Carly Hataway, who spoke to the &lt;i&gt;WSJ&lt;/i&gt; about her experience. After years of trying to understand her hormones and why she seemed to be so affected by fluctuations, she wasn’t convinced when her doctor told her to go back on the pill. So she turned instead to an alternative health practitioner who ordered a battery of blood and urine tests. “I finally figured out that my cortisol was really high and that my progesterone and my oestrogen [sic] were low,” said Hataway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, of course, she posted the results to her 70,000 TikTok followers. The flood of support that followed shows why this world is so seductive: rejecting your doctor’s bad advice feels like independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great irony in all this is that the wellness ecosystem is driven by profit. Influencers with something to sell thrive on creating a sense that their target market is missing something in their lives. All the while, the efficacy of the wellness industry is increasingly questionable. Little of this is evidence-based, and most of the research is extremely limited. Influencers often lean heavily on phrases like “preliminary findings” and “emerging science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this trend exposes is a broader collapse of trust in expertise. In this case, the old medical paternalism hasn’t been replaced by better self-guided care, but by naked consumerism resting on junk science.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), "An estimated 1.4 billion adults aged 30–79 years worldwide had hypertension in 2024; this represents 33% of the population in this age range." However, high blood pressure often doesn't show clear symptoms until it is too late. "An estimated 600 million adults with hypertension (44%) are unaware that they have the condition," the WHO states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so, your lifestyle-- which includes your everyday diet plays a huge role in managing it. Certain foods can help relax blood vessels, reduce sodium levels, and improve heart health, while others can silently push your blood pressure higher. Thus, making simple changes in your food habits can show great effects on your overall well-being. Here we list some of the best foods one should have and the worst foods one should avoid for high blood pressure (BP):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>X世代对食物上瘾--以及为什么它比其他世代更能杀死他们--《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-fitness/gen-x-ultra-processed-food-diet-industry-b2856329.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 bxpovR sc-jbiisr-1 sc-1wfc891-0 fooWDH" id="main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="big-letter"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;oe &lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/tim-spector-joe-wicks-killer-protein-bar-channel-4-b2840149.html" title="Tim Spector: Joe Wicks’s ‘killer’ protein bar is getting attention, but this is what he’s getting wrong about UPFs"&gt;Wicks&lt;/a&gt; and Dr Chris Van Tulleken, creating the world’s most harmful protein bar in Channel 4’s &lt;em&gt;Licensed to Kill &lt;/em&gt;last month, made headlines. The sweeteners, goo, flavouring and other industrially produced edible substances they poured into an innocent-looking and apparently extremely tasty fake chocolate bar, have been linked to diarrhoea, other gut issues, an increased risk of stroke, cancer, and what Van Tulleken describes with alarming confidence as “early death”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nation trembled. But who should have been trembling in a very specific way? &lt;a href="/life-style/gen-x-ai-jobs-redundancy-b2815946.html" title="Why Gen X might be the winners in the AI job revolution as their children flounder"&gt;Generation X&lt;/a&gt;. Snagged silently between the gobby social media hoggers of baby boomers and millennials, those of us who’d been paying attention to US medical journals (a very specific subset, admittedly) would have seen, just one week previously, a paper from the University of Michigan, which discovered that this has all affected Gen X’s &lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/winter-health-cold-flu-sad-diet-tips-b2850703.html" title="Feeling run down? Try these six nutrition-packed ways to eat your way to better health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; in a very unique way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s only the second piece of research in the US looking at the intersection between older age groups and ultra-processed food (UPF), and it points out that Generation X were the first generation to have UPF feature heavily in their diets from an early age. The results are clear. Twenty-one per cent of women and 10 per cent of men in &lt;a href="/life-style/gen-x-retirement-poverty-b2794622.html" title="We’re not done yet: Why Gen X has a right to retire in dignity, not poverty"&gt;Generation X &lt;/a&gt;meet criteria for addiction to UPFs, outweighing other addictions like alcoholism (1.5 per cent) and smoking (4 per cent ). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “ultra-processed foods”, just in case you’ve not come across it, was defined by the Nova food classification system, developed by researchers at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. It defines food in four categories depending on what’s been done to it during its production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unprocessed or minimally processed foods include fruit, vegetables, milk, fish, eggs and other foods with no added ingredients. Processed ingredients include salt, sugar and oils used to cook with. Processed foods combining groups one and two in a way you could do at home, like jam, pickles, tinned fruit and vegetables. Ultra-processed foods, however, have more than one ingredient that you’d never find in a kitchen, such as chemical-based preservatives, emulsifiers, sweeteners, artificial colours and flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s only half the story. It doesn’t explain why those &lt;a href="/life-style/gen-z-gen-x-workplace-politics-b2477082.html" title="Leave Gen Z alone, Jodie... it’s Gen X you should worry about in the workplace"&gt;Gen X&lt;/a&gt;ers got addicted, showing strong cravings, repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down and withdrawal symptoms. It also doesn’t explain why some of this cohort say they even sometimes avoid social situations because of fear of overeating. Or why they over-index as UPF addicts who are overweight, are isolated and have poor mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boomers, by the way, not so much. Just 12 per cent of women and 4 per cent of men from the golden generation count as UPF addicts. In case the cheap housing, large pensions and jobs for life weren’t enough of a reward for being born in the 1950s and early 60s, they’d also been taught to cook from scratch – a habit many of them never abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generation X was the first to grow up surrounded by ultra-processed foods,” Dr Karen Mann, medical director for the digital health app Noom. “If you were a child in the 1970s or 1980s like I was, you probably remember being bombarded with ads for brightly packaged snacks, fast food, and ‘convenience’ meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/13/iStock-1314465900.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/13/iStock-1314465900.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/13/iStock-1314465900.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Pop-Tarts, a staple in the 1970s" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-199970"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 ghyfOu hgzWpY"&gt;Pop-Tarts, a staple in the 1970s&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 fbYyBW"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those foods weren’t just available, they were marketed as normal, fun, and family-friendly. In a sense, Gen X was the first test case for how a diet dominated by engineered, hyperpalatable products affects long-term eating behaviour. And being young when UPF arrived shaped Generation X’s tastes and habits early on, making those foods more difficult to resist later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was also a generation when both parents started to work too and a more educated population meant many moved away from extended family as they sought out new work opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It created a latchkey generation, with parents leaving us food things like French bread pizzas, Findus Crispy Pancakes and Pop-Tarts to snack on when we got home from school,” adds Rob Hobson, nutritionist and author of &lt;em&gt;Unprocess Your Family Life&lt;/em&gt;. “Our teeth have suffered, we have a mouthful of fillings, our diets suffered and now we’re reaching midlife, we have high rates of metabolic issues – weight gain, cardiovascular risk, all that kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a card-carrying member of Gen X, I look back on Findus Crispy Pancakes, Vesta Curries, Alphabetti Spaghetti, Mr Kipling Cakes, Dalepak Steaks and Birds Eye Potato Waffles with genuine affection. There were no health warnings for us. We were just told that Mr Kipling baked exceedingly good cakes, Birds Eye Potato Waffles were waffley versatile and Angel Delight was not only delicious, it was also delovely, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1wzq3bw-0 sc-1wzq3bw-2 kqnNdl mbxVq"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-i07cwn-0 dvtoxw"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7b73b88eb27c89ab" viewbox="0 0 80 47"&gt;&lt;path fill="#eb1426" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our teeth have suffered, we have a mouthful of fillings, our diets suffered and now we’re reaching midlife, we have high rates of metabolic issues – weight gain, cardiovascular risk, all that kind of stuff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wzq3bw-4 gIguDj"&gt;Rob Hobson, nutritionist and author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, UPF’s high calorie content and semi-industrial structure – which makes it faster to eat and faster to digest – is thanks to the American biologist Paul Ehrlich who, in 1968, predicted that the US would face widespread famines in the 1980s, with millions dying of starvation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote the then-seminal work &lt;em&gt;The Population Bomb&lt;/em&gt;, a grim but entirely incorrect book that saw the post-war surge in the population as unsustainable. There were so many of you, they thought we’d all starve. Instead, between 1980 and 1998, we saw the emergence of Big Food to feed us all, and obesity rates trebled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 liYOkd"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/58/iStock-513001921.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/58/iStock-513001921.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/58/iStock-513001921.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Alphabet spaghetti in tomato sauce" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-199971"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 ghyfOu hgzWpY"&gt;Alphabet spaghetti in tomato sauce&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 fbYyBW"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That famine fear gave huge financial incentives for greater food energy creation and technological advances that lead to nutrient-poor industrial food products dense in calories per bite, high in too much saturated fat, high in too much added sugar, high in too much salt, far too low in fibre but very cheap,” explains Sam Dicken, research fellow at the Centre for Obesity Research at UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “There were tobacco companies getting into food production, using their marketing tricks and product innovations. It was really hard to avoid. We didn’t even have nutritional standards for food until the 1990s. It was an unregulated market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, of course, was tragic for a generation of kids being brought up on this stuff in the Seventies and Eighties, and then came a cunning switcheroo, which would make things even worse. Having pumped us full of calories, UPF food companies then sold us diet foods like Diet Coke, low-fat or fat-free versions of cereals, yogurts and non-butter spreads – with sugar replaced by aspartame, which can create sugar cravings and fat replaced with sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, the University of Michigan research suggests, may account for women’s higher addiction to UPF. “One explanation may be the aggressive marketing of ‘diet’ ultra-processed food to women in the 1980s,” according to Ashley Gearhardt, professor of psychology at the university. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fcDPtv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/30/17/39/GettyImages-2204586320.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/30/17/39/GettyImages-2204586320.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/30/17/39/GettyImages-2204586320.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Kate Moss, part of Generation X, would have been exposed to the likes of Angel Delight, Findus Crispy Pancakes and Pop-Tarts" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-199972"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 ghyfOu hgzWpY"&gt;Kate Moss, part of Generation X, would have been exposed to the likes of Angel Delight, Findus Crispy Pancakes and Pop-Tarts&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 fbYyBW"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Low-fat cookies, microwaveable meals and other carbohydrate-heavy products were sold as health foods, which can be especially problematic for those trying to reduce the number of calories they consume. Their engineered nutrient profiles may reinforce addictive eating patterns. This especially affects women, because of the societal pressure around weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And to add a cultural smack in the face to the UPF injury, as poor old Gen X staggered uncertainly into the 1990s, they faced a wave of insane fad diets like the detox diet (consume only water or juice); the cabbage soup diet (seven days on just low calorie cabbage soup); the food combining diet (don’t eat certain foods in the same meal because they digest at different rates) and the Atkins diet (eat as much protein and fat as you like but no carbs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friends tried most of these. “I nearly attacked my flatmate for eating toast while I was detoxing, it smelt so good,” one recalls. “While on the cabbage soup diet, I actually passed out using the treadmill at the gym.” Another says; “Honestly, I think I tried everything that came along. They made me angry and so hungry I’d break and just stuff my face. It was the 1990s, so I had unhealthy relationships with everything – pills, coke, food, diets and booze. Weirdly, I look back on it as a fun decade. I guess that’s because the Cold War was over and the war on terror hadn’t arrived. The only person working hard to kill me was me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caroline Buck, a health psychologist, and Dr Abigail Fisher, professor of physical activity and health, work at the Centre for Obesity Research with Sam Dicken. They’re trying to wean healthcare workers off UPF, telling me: “They’re at high risk down to shift work and lots of UPF available in hospitals,” Buck explains. “But we found that the whole diet culture is an older age thing that we just didn’t see with younger participants in our study. They had a very different mentality.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kHoODI"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/05/iStock-1440058281.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/05/iStock-1440058281.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/19/05/iStock-1440058281.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Pizza on a baguette" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-199973"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 ghyfOu hgzWpY"&gt;Pizza on a baguette&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 fbYyBW"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all age groups, they found that a combination of regular one-to-one online video calls, monthly support groups, setting goals, having them self-monitor, providing booklets and a website with information… It was a lot, all based on something called a behaviour change wheel, which is way more complicated than cabbage soup. And it’s taken six months so far. This is the power of UPF – it’s addictive, but it’s everywhere, and it still makes up 60 per cent of the average UK diet despite people being more aware of it than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder &lt;a href="/health-and-wellbeing/mounjaro-ozempic-weight-loss-jab-study-b2749085.html" title="How Mounjaro became the ‘King Kong’ of weight loss jabs, but here’s the catch..."&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; and Ozempic are so popular among Gen Xers in the UK. Private-market data for Mounjaro indicate that people aged 40-59 make up over half of Mounjaro users, and the average user age was reported as 50.2 years. And older users are also more likely to use it for chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease) rather than solely for slimming, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes me feel a little bad about how little we noticed back in the 1980s. There’s plenty of work done on adolescents, but only now are we really understanding how the early diets of those in their fifties today have impacted their health. Gen X came home from school alone, put the UPF into the microwave and chowed down alone, and then were left to wrestle with the twisted diet culture, which came for them as they hit their twenties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder they call us the forgotten generation. Perhaps it’s time to remind people we’re here, because, if we don’t, the cost of ignoring the mounting health crisis coming down the track will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNbzlkQlJLYkQyWGhjeFU1Y2I3aFYwV0hWWl9EYndHUkVlTXpHbUtGdnpjM0IxaWRua2FTall6VWEtVmtOM1IwLUd3cm5semtlaHM4RTQxMGpDZ2cxSUk3cXZ6eWlOMkpGQXdmTDMzMnlkaXF1WExTckVCUmpmdFBUX2gtR0JRbHROdmc4bWFiRnZrTWFHaEIxQ2tKRXYtazUzblhZSWVR</guid></item><item><title>想要降低血压？营养师说您需要更多这4种营养素- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/nutrients-for-better-blood-pressure-11841273</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your blood pressure is one of those vital signs your doctor likely measures every time you step inside their office, and for good reason: Over time, high blood pressure (also called hypertension) can have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;serious consequences for your heart&lt;/a&gt;, brain, kidneys and other organs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that certain lifestyle changes can help bring your blood pressure into a healthy range (ideally below 120/80 mm Hg), including tweaking your diet to prioritize &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Food can influence blood volume, artery flexibility and how your body &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894212/ways-to-flush-out-excess-sodium-from-your-body/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regulates sodium and fluid balance&lt;/a&gt;, all of which affect blood pressure," says &lt;a href="https://kimblum.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kim Blum, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, here are the top nutrients for better blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-potassium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Potassium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For healthy blood pressure, several decades of research support following the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-dash-diet-meal-plan-for-beginners-11738768" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods high in potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bananas, avocados, potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans and dark leafy greens are all rich in this nutrient.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium plays a key role in reducing blood pressure because it helps your body &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7900585/foods-for-when-youve-had-too-much-sodium/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flush out excess sodium&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://brittanyb.ca/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brittany Brown, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure in some people, but potassium helps shuttle it out of your body through your urine. Potassium also lowers blood pressure by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;relaxing your blood vessels&lt;/a&gt;, allowing blood to flow through more easily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "When potassium levels drop too low, your arteries can stiffen and lose flexibility, leading to higher blood pressure over time," says &lt;a href="https://www.leisanoliving.com/meet-leisan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leisan Echols, M.S., RDN, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with limiting sodium, the American Heart Association recommends getting between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;3,500 and 5,000 milligrams of potassium&lt;/a&gt; per day (from food) if you're trying to prevent or treat hypertension. To put that into perspective, one medium banana delivers about 450 mg of potassium, while a cup of cooked sweet potato contains about 570 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-magnesium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is another featured nutrient in the DASH diet. Like potassium, it can be found in a variety of heart-healthy foods, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vegetables-to-eat-each-week-11746040" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leafy greens, legumes, nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds and whole grains such as brown rice and oatmeal.6 It's also added to some fortified foods, like certain breakfast cereals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Magnesium helps relax muscles, which include the walls of your arteries," explains &lt;a href="https://www.healthyyoubymaura.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maura Fowler, M.P.H, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. "If you don’t eat enough foods with magnesium, it could lead to constricted arteries," which increases blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-rich-foods-11772823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended dietary allowance for magnesium&lt;/a&gt; in adults is 310 to 420 mg, depending on age and sex. An ounce of roasted pumpkin seeds has 156 mg, which gets you more than a third of the way to the higher end of that goal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research also notes that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-11836271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplements may help&lt;/a&gt; lower BP in people who have high blood pressure and low magnesium levels, but you should always talk to your doctor before starting a supplement to make sure it's right for you.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-calcium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Calcium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A third star of the DASH eating plan is the mineral calcium, which is prominent in dairy foods such as milk, yogurt and cheese as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-fortified milk substitutes&lt;/a&gt;, fruit juices, tofu, and cereals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Calcium helps blood vessels tighten and relax as needed," Blum says, which lowers blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. The DASH eating plan recommends that most adults get two to three servings of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fat-free or low-fat dairy&lt;/a&gt; each day. A serving is 1 cup of milk or yogurt or 1.5 ounces of cheese.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike potassium, magnesium and calcium, fiber isn't a mineral. Instead, it's a type of carbohydrate found mainly in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060938/live-longer-fight-climate-change-eat-more-plants/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, and whole grains—all of which feature prominently in the DASH eating plan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber works behind the scenes to influence your blood pressure in more ways than one. "It fuels the good bacteria in your gut, which produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that help reduce inflammation and keep your blood vessels functioning smoothly," Echols says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Fiber also supports better blood sugar control, improves insulin sensitivity, and contributes to weight management, all of which lighten the load on your cardiovascular system."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lentils, collard greens, oats, raspberries, and chia seeds are some of Echols' favorite high-fiber picks. "They’re flexible enough to build into soups, salads and warm breakfast bowls without overthinking it," she notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The DASH eating plan recommends most adults get three to five servings of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2061187/these-are-the-12-most-filling-fruits-and-veggies-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich vegetables and fruits&lt;/a&gt; as well as four to eight servings of whole grains each day and three to five servings of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nuts, seeds, and legumes&lt;/a&gt; per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Regular exercise (at least 150 minutes per week)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting smoking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting alcohol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Losing weight if you have overweight or obesity &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting enough quality sleep (least seven hours each night)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Keep calm and try &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;. The fatty acids, available as dietary supplements via fish oil capsules and thought to help with mental and physical well-being, could also cut down on aggression, according to a 2024 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings haven't come out of nowhere: omega-3 has previously been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fish-oil-helps-at-risk-teenagers-avoid-schizophrenia-even-8-years-later"&gt;preventing schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, while aggression and antisocial behavior are thought in part to stem from a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/190990"&gt;lack of nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. What we eat can influence our brain's chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania built on earlier, smaller studies of omega-3 supplementation effects on aggression. Their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="179839" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at 29 randomized controlled trials across 3,918 participants in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/angry-outbursts-could-literally-be-putting-some-peoples-heart-at-risk"&gt;Angry Outbursts Could Literally Be Putting Some People's Heart at Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all the trials, a modest but noticeable short-term effect was found, translating to up to a 28 percent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/venting-doesnt-reduce-anger-but-something-else-does-study-finds"&gt;reduction in aggression&lt;/a&gt; across multiple different variables (including age, gender, medical diagnosis, and length and dosage of treatment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the time has come to implement omega-3 supplementation to reduce aggression, irrespective of whether the setting is the community, the clinic, or the criminal justice system," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurocriminologist Adrian Raine when the meta-analysis was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg" alt="Flow diagram detailing steps of review process." class="wp-image-149438 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-642x495.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-538x415.jpg 538w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-600x463.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flow diagram of literature search leading to 28 suitable papers.

They covered a variety of demographics, from &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.12314"&gt;children aged 16 and under&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10284150290007119"&gt;older people aged between 50 and 60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the reductions in aggression included both reactive aggression (in response to provocation) and proactive aggression (behavior planned in advance). Before this study, it wasn't clear if omega-3 could help with these different types of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies across longer periods of time are going to be needed to further establish this relationship, it adds to our understanding of how fish oil pills and the omega-3 in them might be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-kids-with-adhd-may-see-improvement-with-fish-oil-pills-but-results-are-mixed"&gt;beneficial for the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the very least, parents seeking treatment for an aggressive child should know that in addition to any other treatment that their child receives, an extra portion or two of fish each week could also help," Raine &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ExamplesOfFoodsThatHaveOmega3-e1736917333981.jpeg" alt="One Dietary Supplement Found to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%" class="size-full wp-image-149436" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Natural sources of omega-3 in foods.

&lt;p&gt;Long-term use of melatonin supplements, often used to promote sleep and address insomnia, was associated with a higher risk of heart failure diagnosis, heart failure hospitalization and death from any cause in chronic insomnia, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the body by the pineal gland, and it helps regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin levels increase during darkness and decrease during daylight. Chemically identical synthetic versions of the hormone are often used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling and/or staying asleep) and jet lag. The supplements are widely available over the counter in many countries, including the U.S. In the U.S., over-the-counter supplements are not regulated, so each brand of supplement can vary in strength, purity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers classified people who had used melatonin long-term (with long-term use defined as a year or more documented in their electronic health records) as part of the "melatonin group." In contrast, those who never had melatonin recorded anywhere in their medical records were classified as the "non-melatonin group."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melatonin supplements may not be as harmless as commonly assumed. If our study is confirmed, this could affect how doctors counsel patients about sleep aids."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, M.D., lead author of the study and chief resident in internal medicine at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in Brooklyn, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melatonin supplements are promoted and marketed as a safe sleep aid; however, data demonstrating their long-term cardiovascular safety are lacking, which prompted the researchers to examine whether melatonin use alters the risk of heart failure, specifically in chronic insomnia patients. According to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs for them to function properly and is a common condition that affects 6.7 million adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a large international database (the TriNetX Global Research Network), the researchers reviewed 5 years of electronic health records for adults with chronic insomnia who had melatonin recorded in their health records and used it for more than a year. They were matched with peers in the database who also had insomnia but never had melatonin recorded in their health records. People were excluded from the analysis if they had previously been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Among adults with insomnia, those whose electronic health records indicated long-term melatonin use (12 months or more) had about a 90% higher chance of incident heart failure over 5 years compared with matched non-users (4.6% vs. 2.7%, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There was a similar result (82% higher) when researchers analyzed people who had at least 2 melatonin prescriptions filled at least 90 days apart. (Melatonin is only available by prescription in the United Kingdom.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants taking melatonin were nearly 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure when compared to those not taking melatonin (19.0% vs. 6.6%, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants in the melatonin group were nearly twice as likely to die from any cause than those in the non-melatonin group (7.8% vs. 4.3%, respectively) over the 5-year period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Melatonin supplements are widely thought of as a safe and 'natural' option to support better sleep, so it was striking to see such consistent and significant increases in serious health outcomes, even after balancing for many other risk factors," Nnadi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised that physicians would prescribe melatonin for insomnia and have patients use it for more than 365 days, since melatonin, at least in the U.S., is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia. In the U.S., melatonin can be taken as an over-the-counter supplement and people should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication," said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D., C.C.S.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the American Heart Association's 2025 scientific statement, Multidimensional Sleep Health: Definitions and Implications for Cardiometabolic Health. St-Onge, who was not involved in this study, is a professor of nutritional medicine in the division of general medicine and director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research in the department of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. First, the database includes countries that require a prescription for melatonin (such as the United Kingdom) and countries that don't (such as the United States), and patient locations were not part of the de-identified data available to the researchers. Since melatonin use in the study was based only on those identified from medication entries in the electronic health record, everyone taking it as an over-the-counter supplement in the U.S. or other countries that don't require a prescription would have been in the non-melatonin group; therefore, the analyses may not accurately reflect this. Hospitalization figures were also higher than those for initial diagnosis of heart failure because a range of related diagnostic codes may be entered for the hospitalization, and they may not always include the code for a new diagnosis of heart failure. The researchers also lacked information on the severity of insomnia and the presence of other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Worse insomnia, depression/anxiety or the use of other sleep-enhancing medicines might be linked to both melatonin use and heart risk," Nnadi said. "Also, while the association we found raises safety concerns about the widely used supplement, our study cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. This means more research is needed to test melatonin's safety for the heart."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The study included 130,828 adults (average age of 55.7 years; 61.4% women) diagnosed with insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The study data was from TriNetX, established in 2013, a growing global network of real-world, de-identified patient data available for research.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;65,414 participants had been prescribed melatonin at least once and reported taking it for at least a year.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A second group of people were examined for comparison (control group) - those who had never been prescribed melatonin and were matched to the group taking melatonin on 40 factors including demographic information, health conditions and medications. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants were excluded if they had already been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other types of sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The melatonin and control groups were matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, heart and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-the-Nervous-System.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt; diseases, medications for heart and nervous system diseases, blood pressure and body mass index. Researchers looked at electronic medical records from the five years after the matching date.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For the main findings, records were searched for codes related to an initial diagnosis of heart failure. Secondary findings included codes for hospitalization related to heart failure or death.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Following the initial analyses, researchers validated the credibility of their findings by conducting a sensitivity analysis. This involved slightly changing the criteria: they required participants in the melatonin group to have filled at least two melatonin prescriptions that were at least 90 days apart. This adjustment aimed to determine whether the extended duration of confirmed melatonin prescriptions influenced the outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17963-6" target="_blank"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests a profound link between how we perceive our bodies and our ability to recall events from our personal history. This finding is the first to show that temporarily changing one’s sense of bodily self can facilitate the retrieval of remote memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was led by a team of neuroscientists at Anglia Ruskin University who were exploring the connection between the self, the body, and autobiographical memory. Our memories are not just recordings of external events; they are experiences that happened to us while we inhabited a particular body. The researchers reasoned that since our bodies change throughout our lives, the physical self we had in childhood is different from the one we have as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When our childhood memories were formed, we had a different body,” said senior author Jane Aspell, who leads the Self &amp;amp; Body Lab at Anglia Ruskin University. “So we wondered: if we could help people experience aspects of that body again, could we help them recall their memories from that time?” This question formed the basis for their experiment, which sought to see if reintroducing body-related cues from the past could help reactivate memories associated with that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers recruited 50 healthy adults for an online experiment. Participants were randomly split into two groups. In the experimental group, individuals viewed a live video of their own face that had been digitally altered with a filter to look like a childlike version of themselves. The control group viewed a live, unaltered video of their adult faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then induced what is known as an “enfacement illusion.” Participants were instructed to move their heads in time with a metronome. For both groups, the face on the screen would mirror their movements, creating a powerful sensation that the face they were seeing was their own, similar to looking in a mirror. This synchronous movement was designed to create a strong feeling of ownership over the on-screen face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the strength of the illusion, the experiment also included a condition with asynchronous movement. In this part, the face on the screen moved in the opposite direction to the participant’s head movements, which tends to weaken the feeling of ownership. After each session of head movements, participants answered a questionnaire to measure how strongly they felt that the face on the screen was their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following the illusion, participants engaged in an autobiographical memory interview. While still viewing either their childlike or adult face, they were asked to recall specific events from two different time periods: their childhood (up to age 11) and the past year. The researchers provided cues like “home” or “holiday” to prompt the memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s primary interest was not just whether people could remember events, but the richness of those memories. The interviews were recorded and scored based on the level of detail provided. Specifically, the researchers distinguished between two types of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is semantic memory, which involves factual information, like the name of a place you visited. The other is episodic memory, which involves the ability to mentally re-experience an event, recalling sensory details, emotions, and the feeling of being there. This is often described as a form of mental “time travel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear difference between the two groups. Participants who experienced the illusion with their childlike face recalled significantly more episodic details about their childhood memories compared to the control group who saw their adult faces. This effect was specific to childhood memories; the illusion had no impact on the recall of recent events from the past year. It also did not affect the recall of semantic, or factual, details about childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Utkarsh Gupta, who conducted the study as part of his PhD, explained the potential mechanism behind the results. “All the events that we remember are not just experiences of the external world, but are also experiences of our body, which is always present,” he said. “We discovered that temporary changes to the bodily self, specifically, embodying a childlike version of one’s own face, can significantly enhance access to childhood memories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, “This might be because the brain encodes bodily information as part of the details of an event. Reintroducing similar bodily cues may help us retrieve those memories, even decades later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted some limitations and areas for future exploration. The strength of the illusion, whether induced by synchronous or asynchronous movement, did not appear to affect the amount of memory detail recalled. This may suggest that simply viewing and identifying with the childlike face was enough to trigger the memory enhancement, a phenomenon that could be related to priming. Future studies could directly compare the embodiment illusion with a simpler priming condition, such as just looking at a static picture of a young face, to separate these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was that the digital filter was a generic approximation of a younger face, not a personalized rendering based on participants’ actual childhood photos. Future experiments in a lab setting could use more advanced technology to create more realistic and personalized younger selves, possibly strengthening the effect. Researchers also suggest that modifying the protocol to administer the illusion questionnaire after the memory interview could help avoid biasing participants’ responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings open up new possibilities for understanding memory. They suggest that the self is not a single, static entity but is fluid, and that our memories are deeply intertwined with our physical form at the time they were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are really exciting and suggest that further, more sophisticated body illusions could be used to unlock memories from different stages of our lives – perhaps even from early infancy,” said Aspell. She suggested that in the future, it might be possible to adapt these techniques “to create interventions that might aid memory recall in people with memory impairments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17963-6" target="_blank"&gt;Illusory ownership of one’s younger face facilitates access to childhood episodic autobiographical memories&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Utkarsh Gupta, Peter Bright, Waheeb Zafar, Pilar Recarte-Perez, Alex Clarke, and Jane E. Aspell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:05:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPT2x2M0R4SUg4a3ozVHlja3FEeE90ZndDdWFGc2tzUjZhbmdjUUcxT1U2SkhBWmtmWkxSX3ViQTNSY2UwblF4TUhJODRQb0ZFVkp3cTJCZ2RWUGJ1SmhuanRtSUl6N3ExWVJmVGwtVTNIOVRDNmFJenJDaDcwZ2J4RTc5UnZCSXU2OHU5OXg1ckQwVjM0N195UVZFSDJnUFYzamJHWmxwMWJOOXNPU204OHQ0RzQ</guid></item><item><title>科学让花生过敏全错了–直到科学方法正确- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/health/peanut-allergy-researcher</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0003356nzti48g0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was a question Dr. Gideon Lack asked often, when giving lectures to fellow allergists and pediatricians on the topic of food allergies: How many doctors in the room had a patient allergic to peanuts?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0004356nrwj3r31f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Normally, “virtually every doctor would have put up their hand,” Lack said. Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies, affecting more than 2% of US children, with a similar &lt;a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/resources/peanut-allergy-factsheet/" target="_blank"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, where Lack was practicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0005356nbenw5p9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But at a lecture in Tel Aviv, Israel, about 25 years ago, the audience’s response took Lack by surprise. Only two or three out of about 200 raised their hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0006356nz8q0prs0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I said, ‘Wait, this doesn’t make sense,’ ” he recalled recently. “I was practicing in London, which has a big Jewish community, and I was seeing a high frequency of peanut allergy amongst Jewish children who share similar ancestral background.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0007356n0i6tol41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack and his colleagues’ investigations into why, which played out over the next 15 years, led to last month’s remarkable &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/peanut-allergy-guidance-change-wellness"&gt;finding&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of peanut allergies in the US – after a precipitous rise – appeared to have fallen dramatically.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0008356nxbol2yoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It turned out that the guidance parents and pediatricians – and Lack himself – had been following, to avoid giving peanuts to babies and young children to try to prevent the development of dangerous allergies, was completely backward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0009356nbecgiuzw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By thinking we were protecting them, we were actually causing the problem,” Lack told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000a356nup77hdz5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The story of how he and his colleagues proved that was the case is a primer in the &lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/videos/the-scientific-process" target="_blank"&gt;scientific process&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000c356nehco6urw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a joke in Israel that the first three words babies learn are “mother,” “father” and “Bamba,” Lack said – for the peanut puff snacks that Israeli parents give babies when they’re very young.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000d356n2m8tlcn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’ve sort of become a national snack,” he noted, pointing out that the joke is actually “a truism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000e356nn1bx6z2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he had conversations with the doctors there, as well as parents of young children, “They all told me one very clear thing: ‘We give peanut snacks to our babies from between 4 and 6 months of age.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000f356nl23044wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bambas contain “vast amounts of peanut protein,” Lack said. And he came to suspect that, just by “happenstance … this product was developed in Israel and protected the Israeli population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000g356n0l3c1h2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that was an observation, something he’d learned at a lecture, Lack emphasized. “That’s not really proof of anything.” Could there be other differences Israeli children experience - weather, sunshine, vitamin D exposure - that could have contributed?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000h356ncm7bqm4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So he and a team of colleagues set out to study it. They looked at about 5,000 schoolchildren in Israel and 5,000 Jewish schoolchildren in London who shared a similar ancestral background – to control for genetic differences – and compared their rates of peanut allergy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000i356n4chbnj5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the UK, it was tenfold higher”: almost 2% of kids, Lack said, whereas in Israel, it “virtually didn’t exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000j356naz22rqr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Examining the children’s diets, including when peanuts were introduced in the first year of life, revealed an obvious difference: UK babies were consuming a median zero grams of peanut per week. Israeli babies were eating about 2 grams – equivalent, in Bambas form, to about 10 weekly peanuts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000k356nle88cvc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The kids were eating this with great relish,” Lack noted; it’s a “very popular snack.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000l356nyammts9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “at the time when I suggested this hypothesis, it was virtually impossible to get funding,” he said. He and his team turned to the &lt;a href="https://nationalpeanutboard.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National Peanut Board&lt;/a&gt;, the group representing American peanut farmers. He said the study was criticized for who funded it but emphasized that it had no bearing on the outcome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000m356ndhlnsp6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The idea of eating peanuts was felt to be preposterous, that we would be putting babies at risk and causing peanut allergy based on the old thinking we had, and that it would even be an unethical thing to do,” he recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000n356nbjh8egus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The results suggested otherwise. But&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the work was only beginning.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000p356nj098zwo9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What Lack and his colleagues had shown with that study, which was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19000582/" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in 2008, was an &lt;em&gt;association &lt;/em&gt;between eating peanuts early in infancy and a lower likelihood of developing peanut allergy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000q356nkwm14gk2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What they wanted to prove was that early introduction of peanuts was the &lt;em&gt;cause &lt;/em&gt;of those reduced allergy rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000r356nj6jzhklq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that, they’d need to run a randomized controlled trial, in which they randomly separated participants – in this case, infants with severe eczema, egg allergy or both, putting them at higher risk of peanut allergy – into two groups. One set was directed to consume foods with peanut - such as Bambas peanut puffs - starting between 4 and 11 months of age, and the other was told to avoid them until they turned 5 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000s356nft4nkr3w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, Lack and his colleagues received funding from the US National Institutes of Health, specifically the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Lack called “patient and generous.” It was not an overnight result. It took two years to recruit the 640 infants into the trial, Lack said, and then they were followed for five years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000t356nurmayp96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The results were stark. Of the 530 kids who didn’t start out with a sensitivity to peanut, 13.7% developed peanut allergy by age 5 if they avoided peanuts. In the group that consumed peanuts starting before age 1, 1.9% developed peanut allergy. Among kids who’d shown signs of sensitivity to start with, 35.3% who avoided peanuts developed the allergy, versus 10.6% of those who ate them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000u356nitg99pjk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was hoping for an effect, but I was not expecting to see a more than 80% reduction,” Lack said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000v356njoh2j59c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the biostatisticians called him and colleague Dr. George Du Toit with the results, “we toasted the good news to whiskey and roasted peanuts,” Lack recalled. They published the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank"&gt;findings &lt;/a&gt;from the trial, called the LEAP study, in 2015 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000x356nmgxc59af@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It wasn’t clear, though, whether the message would resonate with parents and pediatricians – if they could change course and do the opposite of what they’d been told for so long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000y356n3lfz2iu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10920165/" target="_blank"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; had been issued in 2000 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and although they’re often described now without nuance, they were anything but definitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000z356npbcbd90q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Conclusive studies are not yet available to permit definitive recommendations,” the academy’s Committee on Nutrition wrote in a document about hypoallergenic infant formulas. For infants at high risk of developing allergies, the committee continued, “the following recommendations seem reasonable at this time” – including delaying introduction of dairy products until 1 year, eggs until 2 years and peanuts, nuts and fish until age 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0010356nwt58cge3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack himself followed the avoidance guidance with his own sons, which of course, “in retrospect, was the wrong advice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0011356nc95eahk0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he emphasizes that the scientific process of proving it was the way medicine should work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0012356nlo1xv0p4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The history of medicine is a series of zigzags,” he said. “It’s not one linear, perfect progression, and people forget that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0013356n0kjzok2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6157280/#:~:text=In%202008%2C%20the%20AAP%20partially,for%20introducing%20peanut%2Dcontaining%20foods." target="_blank"&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; its guidance that said potential allergens should be avoided for high-risk babies, but didn’t have enough data to recommend introducing them early.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhf734ly0001356nf3pzsyow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the LEAP study was published in 2015, the guidance was updated in what researchers now refer to as a landmark move, and the recommendations were expanded in 2017 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0014356nmk27clxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal Pediatrics found that rates of peanut allergies among US kids 3 and under declined 33% after the 2015 recommendation and fell 43% after 2017 – and peanut allergies slipped from being the most prevalent to the second-most, behind eggs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0015356n2yy7pubv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Study leader Dr. David Hill of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia notes that those reductions, extrapolated to the number of US kids under age 3, suggest that almost 40,000 children may have avoided peanut allergy diagnoses since the guidelines changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0017356n1zf60kgk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack’s work continues. He’s currently co-leading another trial funded by the NIH, called the &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10825608" target="_blank"&gt;SEAL study&lt;/a&gt;. It seeks to test another question that once seemed backward: Could treating eczema early in a baby’s life prevent the development of food allergies?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0018356n75arbqh0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For years, we used to think that food allergies cause eczema,” Lack said. “Now we know it’s the reverse.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0019356nfkjih8ij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea is referred to as the dual-exposure hypothesis, and Hill noted that it’s supported by decades of research, including from the LEAP trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001a356np9v7aguy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Early exposure to food proteins through the gut promotes tolerance, teaching the immune system that these foods are safe,” he told CNN. “In contrast, exposure through inflamed or disrupted skin – as often occurs in infants with eczema – can sensitize the immune system and increase the likelihood of developing food allergy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001b356n6pxmqr5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            He put the hypothesis another way: “If I were to knock on your front door and ask for directions, you’d probably greet me in a civil way. But if I were to break into one of the windows, you might greet me in a different way.”

During deep rest, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates through brain tissue, clearing away waste and restoring balance in neural communication. When this cycle is disrupted, the effects reach far beyond fatigue, influencing memory, focus, and emotional stability. In recent years, scientists have turned their attention to how this cleansing process is controlled and what happens when it falters. Understanding how sleep loss alters CSF movement reveals not only why mental clarity suffers after sleepless nights but also how long-term deprivation may affect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does your brain do when you sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every night, while the body appears still, the brain becomes remarkably active in maintenance. CSF, a clear liquid that cushions and nourishes the brain and spinal cord, pulses through networks of neural tissue. Its main role is to remove metabolic waste such as beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which accumulate during wakefulness. These same proteins are linked to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, making efficient CSF circulation essential for long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Impact of Sleep on Brain Function and Mental Well-being&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sleep, particularly in slow-wave phases, the brain’s electrical activity changes rhythmically. Neuronal firing slows, blood flow patterns shift, and the spaces between brain cells expand, allowing CSF to flow more freely. This combination of slowed activity and increased fluid movement acts as the brain’s own detoxification system. When this process is interrupted, the brain’s ability to regulate toxins and maintain functional balance becomes impaired, a disruption that researchers increasingly connect to cognitive and emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does lack to sleep harm your brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;recent study published in Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; used advanced imaging and electrophysiological measurements to explore how sleep deprivation affects the coupling between brain activity and CSF flow. Researchers monitored participants who underwent controlled sleep loss, measuring changes in neural oscillations, blood oxygenation, and CSF movement during subsequent rest periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed a striking pattern: after extended wakefulness, the natural synchronisation between brain activity and fluid circulation weakened noticeably. Under normal conditions, waves of neural activity guide CSF pulses through the brain’s ventricles in a tightly coordinated rhythm. However, when subjects were sleep-deprived, this rhythm broke down, leading to slower, less effective fluid movement. The study also recorded increased variability in blood flow across regions responsible for attention and executive function, suggesting that the consequences of disrupted CSF dynamics extend into areas governing higher-order cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that this decoupling coincided with measurable declines in reaction speed and working memory performance. Even short-term sleep loss, they noted, can reduce the brain’s metabolic clearance efficiency. These findings shed light on why lack of sleep so quickly affects focus, reasoning, and emotional control; it is not only about fatigue but also about an internal breakdown in the brain’s waste management and communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When does the brain falls out of sync&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation affects more than just the physical movement of CSF. It disrupts the delicate timing between electrical and vascular activity that keeps the brain’s systems in sync. Normally, waves of low-frequency oscillations act as signals that coordinate blood and CSF flow. When these oscillations lose their rhythm, neural communication becomes noisy and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In imaging data, this manifests as diminished coupling between deep and superficial brain regions, particularly within the prefrontal cortex—the area responsible for decision-making and attention control. The disrupted synchrony means that messages between networks arrive either too early or too late, reducing overall cognitive precision. People who have gone without sleep often experience this as “mental fog” or difficulty maintaining focus, but the physiological cause lies in impaired timing between neurons and supporting fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study found that even after a recovery night of rest, the brain’s coordination of fluid and electrical rhythms did not fully return to normal, indicating that the effects of acute deprivation can linger. This persistence suggests that the brain requires more than one night of quality sleep to fully recalibrate its internal systems after extended wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is proper sleep essential&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep and brain health extends well beyond temporary tiredness. Persistent deprivation weakens the brain’s ability to clear neurotoxic waste, allowing harmful proteins to accumulate over time. Research into neurodegenerative diseases increasingly points to chronic sleep disruption as a contributing factor in cognitive decline. While the Nature Neuroscience study focused on short-term effects, its findings align with broader evidence linking reduced CSF circulation to long-term structural changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal and parietal regions, which are most sensitive to sleep loss, also play critical roles in emotional regulation and memory consolidation. When their function is compromised, individuals may experience heightened stress reactivity, impulsivity, and forgetfulness. Moreover, impaired fluid movement may affect not only toxin clearance but also the distribution of nutrients and hormones critical for neural repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this connection has significant implications for public health. As modern lifestyles increasingly compress sleep schedules, disruptions in CSF dynamics may become more common. The findings emphasise that consistent, high-quality sleep is not simply a matter of rest but a biological necessity for maintaining the brain’s internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spilled your coffee while rushing out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You struggled to change a setting on your phone, only to give up in frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You got a bug bite, or sunburn, or stubbed your toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to stand in a long line or wait in traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone spoke (or chewed gum, or slammed a door) too loudly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone interrupted or ignored you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not the kind of events that disrupt the course of your life. But they are all annoying, and sometimes bothersome enough that they could set the tone for the rest of your day. Annoying experiences like these have also been &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00844845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; ‘micro-stresses’ or ‘daily hassles’. They usually come your way unexpectedly, cause you some stress, and interrupt your flow. Though they are minor compared with, say, a personal attack, an injury or a significant loss, I’ve seen in my work as a psychologist how often people struggle to tolerate annoying things or underestimate their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite likely that you’ve been told ‘don’t sweat the small stuff’ and ‘focus on the bigger picture’. Despite our best efforts, though, many of us sometimes find it hard to shrug off the lingering emotional effect of an annoying experience. Making it worse, you might judge yourself for not being able to just let it go. Even if a particular stressor seems insignificant on its own, annoying experiences can have a cumulative effect. Like drops filling a bucket, they can eventually spill over until you’re suddenly snapping at someone, or &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;tearing up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that accumulated stressors might take a toll in other ways too. For example, a study in the 1980s &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people who experience more daily hassles report greater fatigue, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More recently, researchers have &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00684-004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that increased stress and hassles significantly predicted the consumption of high-fat and high-sugar snack foods, with implications for physical health. And clinical researchers &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-017-1436-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people who reported high levels of daily hassles were significantly more likely to develop generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder or panic disorder over a follow-up period of several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoying experiences are a normal, inevitable part of life. So, whether you’re concerned about their cumulative impact on your wellbeing or just want to reduce the frustration you feel in the moment, there is value in learning to handle annoying things better. This is where evidence-based psychological skills are handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-live-a-values-driven-life-in-the-face-of-dark-emotions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acceptance and commitment therapy&lt;/a&gt; (ACT), there’s an important distinction between &lt;em&gt;unavoidable pain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;avoidable pain&lt;/em&gt;. Micro-stressors such as running late, spilling something on your shirt or receiving a curt text message represent the unavoidable pain that comes with being human. Daily hassles happen. But how you choose to respond to those moments determines whether you add to the stress. Skills grounded in ACT – which I’ll draw from in the rest of this Guide – can help you reduce the avoidable pain that often comes with aversive experiences, including common annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301940?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that ACT can be effective in managing various forms of psychological distress, including those stemming from daily hassles. I’ve seen this happen in my own therapy practice. One client, for example, used to become agitated by his neighbour’s dog barking at random hours of the day and night. Despite his attempt to address the problem by talking to his neighbour, the dog wasn’t going anywhere, and neither was his frustration. Over time and with practice, though, he began to approach the barking with a kind of detachment. The dog didn’t stop barking, but what changed was his ability to pause, notice his frustration, and apply coping skills of the sort I’ll be describing here. That made all the difference. With practice, you too can learn to relate to annoyances in a more skilful way, whatever your next ‘barking dog’ &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;might be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Embrace ‘radical acceptance’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to want to fix or undo the annoyances you encounter. But insisting that a frustrating experience shouldn’t have happened doesn’t change that it did happen. What it does do is deepen your stress. It’s like tugging on a locked door: tiring and ineffective. That’s why you need &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-enjoy-your-problems-and-reach-enlightenment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;radical acceptance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life’s little stressors can feel like a series of tiny battles. If you get lost in knee-jerk responses such as wishful thinking (&lt;em&gt;I wish this weren’t happening&lt;/em&gt;), rumination (&lt;em&gt;Why did that happen?&lt;/em&gt;), self-blame (&lt;em&gt;Why am I so careless?&lt;/em&gt;), or blaming others (&lt;em&gt;They ruined my day&lt;/em&gt;), it keeps you stuck in your head, takes you away from the present, and prolongs your unpleasant emotions. Instead of just feeling irritated about a lost key or a rude comment, you end up dealing with extra mental fatigue, shame or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical acceptance means recognising the reality of what has occurred without resisting it. It doesn’t mean you approve of what’s happened. It simply means you’re no longer fighting something that can’t be changed. It is about laying down your weapons and saying to yourself: &lt;em&gt;This is happening. How can I work with it without getting lost in it?&lt;/em&gt; You’re choosing to no longer let it set the tone for &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;your day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few prompts you can use as gentle reminders to practise radical acceptance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how things have unfolded right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t go back and change what’s happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighting what happened only fuels my pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I resist the past, I lose the present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now is the only moment I can shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how radical acceptance looks in action: you lose your keys. Instead of spiralling into thoughts like &lt;em&gt;Why does this always happen?&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;This is just what I need right now&lt;/em&gt;, you pause and tell yourself something like: &lt;em&gt;This is not ideal. But I don’t want to get stuck on this right now. I’m going to take a breath and calmly retrace my steps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stop resisting reality, you give yourself room to move on with your day, not by denying the frustration, but by refusing to add &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Make room for your emotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are like waves that rise, crest and gently fade away, often within minutes, especially when you give them the space to do so. Each emotion naturally urges you to respond. When you act based on these feelings, it’s called emotion-driven behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, small hassles can trigger big emotional reactions, leading you to quickly engage in emotion-driven behaviours. Have you ever watched someone cut in line at a store? Maybe you experienced a sudden rush of irritation and found yourself glaring at the person, mumbling your disapproval, or speaking curtly to a store employee who wasn’t even aware of the cutting. As natural as it is, automatically doing what a momentary emotion pushes you to do can sometimes take you further away from being the kind of person you want &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can do instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice your feelings: &lt;/strong&gt;emotions live in our bodies first. If you misplace something important, you might feel a knot in your stomach, or your heart racing. When that happens, ask yourself: what am I feeling and sensing right now? Simply noticing your feelings and sensations might seem like a passive response, but it is critical for minimising your entanglement with unpleasant mental content, and it can help you respond to stressors more thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name your feelings: &lt;/strong&gt;take your noticing one step further. You don’t need a poet’s vocabulary to name your feelings; a short and sweet label works.&lt;em&gt; I’m feeling frustrated.&lt;/em&gt; Or: &lt;em&gt;This is anxiety.&lt;/em&gt; You can even imagine that you’re introducing a friend to your feelings: &lt;em&gt;Meet my annoyance. It’s here because the line at the café is moving slower than a sloth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the workability of your response: &lt;/strong&gt;within the ACT model, ‘workable’ actions are the ones that are aligned with your personal values and goals. Basically,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the idea is that every behaviour takes you closer to or further away from the life you want to build for yourself. So, you must ask yourself whether doing what an emotion pushes you to do in the moment would get you closer to that or further from it. You might ask yourself, for example: &lt;em&gt;If I yell at this barista for getting my order wrong, does that help me live the way I want to live?&lt;/em&gt; Or: &lt;em&gt;If I fixate on this person’s annoying hiccups, will it serve me &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;later on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workability is less about what works in a conventional or problem-solving sense, and more about what works for you in relation to your values. It is a question of inner alignment and direction. An impulsive response to feeling annoyed – such as cursing at someone, slamming a door, or texting a snarky message – might bring you temporary comfort, but it isn’t workable if it pulls you away from your values. (As I will describe below, you can also use your values, rather than just your momentary emotions, to guide more workable responses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one more example to demonstrate all these ways of making room for emotions without letting them dictate your behaviour. Let’s say you’re stuck in traffic, and you feel the frustration building. You can first notice what you are feeling in your body. Then you can name the emotion(s) you are feeling (&lt;em&gt;I’m feeling annoyed, and also powerless&lt;/em&gt;). Finally, you can ask yourself about the workability of what you feel the urge to do: &lt;em&gt;Will honking randomly at other drivers help me be the person I want to be? &lt;/em&gt;You can make space for what you are feeling and still make a choice about what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Centre yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, even if you have applied the preceding skills, you might find yourself tense, restless or stirred up. Centring practices offer you a simple and powerful way to return to a place of steadiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60-second reset is a versatile skill to help you pause and ground yourself. It has multiple variations. I suggest you try out each of the suggestions below, practising one of them for 60 seconds when an annoying experience leaves you agitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Feel your feet. &lt;/strong&gt;Bring your attention to the soles of your feet. Imagine roots anchoring you to the earth &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;beneath you.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Belly breathing.&lt;/strong&gt; Place a hand on your stomach, inhale deeply for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale slowly for a count of 6. Repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ground through touch. &lt;/strong&gt;Press your palms together firmly, or grip the edge of a table or chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sigh it out.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a long, audible exhale, like a balloon slowly deflating. Let your body soften with the breath. Breathe in and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quietly hum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tense and release. &lt;/strong&gt;Clench your fists for 7 seconds, then let go for 14 seconds. Repeat a few times to release pent-up tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that these centring activities aren’t just quick, temporary fixes. Each one helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system – the branch responsible for rest, relaxation and restoring calm. With regular practice, these exercises can help you gradually build your capacity to handle daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Commit to acting based on your values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values, in ACT, are &lt;em&gt;freely chosen qualities of being&lt;/em&gt; that reflect how you truly want to live and behave. Your values are your compass. You can think of them as verbs, as ongoing patterns of action. For example, you might recognise ‘being caring’ as one of your most important values. In day-to-day life, you could turn this into specific, values-based actions such as a weekly check-in with your neighbour or a phone call with your friend to see how they are doing. There are concrete steps you can take to put your value into practice; to actively live out your value, rather than just thinking &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="lg:-ml-[150px] font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:pl-10 print:hidden [&amp;amp;_a]:no-underline [&amp;amp;_p]:m-0"

matter when you have annoying experiences because they give you a direction to move in. If you’re feeling irritated by an itchy bug bite after a hike that already wasn’t going the way you planned, you might call to mind your core values and remember that being patient with yourself is one of them. If you’re struggling with setting a ‘smart’ thermostat at home, you might remind yourself that you value being curious, and then decide to search for some pointers online (rather than giving up or slamming the wall in frustration). If you’re annoyed that someone isn’t listening to what you’re saying, you might recall that you value being compassionate, and then ask, respectfully, if they can give you their full attention. These would all be examples of ‘workable’ responses that help you be the kind of person you want &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think for a moment of Elena. She’s working out of her office at home, midway through an important work assignment, when suddenly, outside her window, a parked delivery truck starts beeping loudly and won’t stop. She notices her heart beating faster and a rush of heat flushing her body. She acknowledges the stress to herself (&lt;em&gt;This is causing me stress right now&lt;/em&gt;). Although she has the urge to pound her fist on the desk and even shout at the delivery driver, she pauses instead and asks whether that would serve her. She realises she’s actually faced a few frustrations today, and she takes a minute to centre herself, using the ‘sigh it out’ exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also asks herself, what really matters right now? And, as she answers that question, Elena taps into her values of being compassionate and being flexible. Knowing the driver is just doing their job and will probably depart soon, she fetches her earbuds to help block out the distracting noise until it passes. She resumes her work, feeling like she’s already started to release the stress she was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the practices I’ve shared, I hope you’ll find that, as disruptive as little annoyances like these can be, they also present everyday opportunities to live in a way that’s more closely aligned with your values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;When are you extra-sensitive to annoyance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although hassles can arise at any time, you might find that certain contexts leave you feeling especially vulnerable to irritation. Perhaps it’s during your morning routine, or when there is an unexpected change of plans, or while you are preparing meals. Some physiological states, such as fatigue, overstimulation or a lack of sleep, can also be precipitants of annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming aware of your own ‘tender times’ or vulnerability factors can help you anticipate them so that you can respond more gently to annoying things when they pop up. This is why I often invite my therapy clients to get curious about these patterns as they happen. One client, for instance, realised that the middle of the day, when his energy was running low, tended to be his most reactive time. Another client noticed that his tender time was when he arrived home from work, emotionally exhausted after a long day of talking to people in distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See if you can recognise the contexts that seem most conducive to frustration for you. This is not about getting rid of frustration or irritability altogether during these times, or trying to control your daily hassles. It’s about entering these situations with an awareness of what makes them challenging – and remembering to practise the skills you’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Meeting annoyance with self-compassion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be less easily rattled by annoyances going forward, &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/self-compassion-is-not-self-indulgence-heres-how-to-try-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;practising self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; can also help. Self-compassion is treating yourself with kindness in difficult moments, staying present with what you’re feeling, and remembering that struggling is part of being human. It’s like talking to yourself the way you’d talk to a friend who’s having a rough day. People who &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-be-kinder-to-yourself-by-practising-self-compassion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;practise self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; tend to be more emotionally steady, bounce back faster, and worry less. The psychologist Mark Leary and his team &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-06231-009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that self-compassion acts like a shield, helping people handle little irritations without getting overwhelmed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to practise self-compassion, and you can choose the forms that feel right for you. There are longer, more formal exercises like loving-kindness meditations or journaling, for example. There are also brief and practical ways to bring self-compassion into your day; in my podcast, I &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playing-it-safe/id1513662923?i=1000512408933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;refer&lt;/a&gt; to these practices as self-compassion on-the-go. To practise self-compassion anytime, anywhere – including when you’re dealing with everyday hassles – all you need to do is acknowledge how you feel and check what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you’re stuck in a slow-moving line, or you’re cooking dinner and your partner says something that rubs you the wrong way. After you first name what you feel, as I recommended earlier (eg, &lt;em&gt;This is frustrating&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;That comment really bugs me&lt;/em&gt;), you then ask yourself: &lt;em&gt;How can I respond to myself with kindness?&lt;/em&gt; You might also ask yourself what you need to hear at that moment, or what a kind friend would say to you. All it takes is a little willingness to be gentle with yourself, even if just for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a doer, a striver, or a person who deeply cares about doing things the right way, check out my &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003083153/acceptance-commitment-skills-perfectionism-high-achieving-behaviors-patricia-zurita-ona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Acceptance and Commitment Skills for Perfectionism and High-Achieving Behaviors&lt;/em&gt; (2021). It will help you to compassionately and skilfully manage the frustration that arrives when things don’t go as planned, when people behave in ways they shouldn’t, or when you make mistakes despite your best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you someone who feels things intensely, and who sometimes acts too quickly? For you, annoyances might easily escalate into emotional storms. My &lt;a href="https://exislepublishing.com/product/escaping-the-emotional-roller-coaster-act-for-the-emotionally-sensitive/?srsltid=AfmBOooaHo5NCFCyCvsk_Dk34OjRfgj8JFju-MmYjFzuwFi3HjwgpPJ-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Escaping the Emotional Roller Coaster: ACT for the Emotionally Sensitive&lt;/em&gt; (2018) teaches evidence-based skills, drawn from acceptance and commitment therapy, to help you deal with overwhelming emotions without getting swept away by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about acceptance and commitment skills, particularly as they apply to anxiety-based struggles, you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.thisisdoctorz.com/playing-it-safe-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Playing-it-safe.&lt;/p&gt;

(And no, it’s not “Golden” from &lt;em&gt;KPop Demon Hunters &lt;/em&gt;played for the 10,000th time, though that’s a close second.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s the humble peanut. Even if your child isn’t allergic to the nuts, past surveys have shown as &lt;a href="https://icer.org/assessment/peanut-allergy-2019/#:~:text=Peanut%20is%20a%20common%20childhood,though%20the%20rate%20is%20low."&gt;many as 4.5 percent of kids in the US are&lt;/a&gt;, which means consistently scouring lunchboxes and snack packs for even traces of peanuts. And for a long time, this problem was getting worse — the self-reported prevalence of peanut or tree nut allergies among children in the US &lt;a href="https://www.foodallergy.org/resources/facts-and-statistics"&gt;more than tripled&lt;/a&gt; between 1997 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So here’s a rare public health win you can feel at the playground: Researchers at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and"&gt;compared peanut and food allergies&lt;/a&gt; before pediatric guidelines about feeding changed in 2017 and after, and found that infants and toddlers are being diagnosed with far fewer food allergies now. Comparing pre-guideline rates with the post-2017 period, diagnoses of any food allergy were about 36 percent lower — driven largely by a roughly 43 percent drop in peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The sharp reduction in peanut allergies doesn’t just make it easier for parents to pack lunches across the country. It represents “prevention of a potentially deadly, life-changing diagnosis,” Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/well/peanut-allergy-drop.html"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. And it happened because public health researchers looked hard at the science, realized what they were doing to prevent allergies wasn’t working — and changed tack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-changed-and-why-it-worked" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changed — and why it worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2023posts/to-feed-or-not-to-feed-food-allergy-prevention-in-infants.html"&gt;well-meaning medical advice&lt;/a&gt; told parents that the way to protect children from developing food allergies was to delay the introduction of allergenic foods. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) laid out the following timetable for parents: delay introduction of cow’s milk until an infant is 1 year old, eggs until 2 years old, and nuts and fish until age 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Infant immune and gut systems are still immature, so waiting until children were older and those systems had more fully developed to introduce potentially allergenic foods seemed to make sense, and the advice was widely adopted by parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But that reasoning began to unravel in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850"&gt;2015 with the LEAP trial&lt;/a&gt;, a gold-standard randomized trial that found that high-risk babies who started peanuts early and kept eating it through childhood had about an 80 percent lower risk of developing a peanut allergy by age 5, compared to those kept off the nuts. Follow-up work showed that protection persisted into adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The shift reveals &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9268235/#:~:text=At%20around%20six%20months%2C%20but,around%206%20months%20of%20age."&gt;the value of dual-exposure&lt;/a&gt;: Early oral exposure to allergenic proteins found in foods like peanuts trains the immune system to tolerate them, while exposure through inflamed skin — common in babies with eczema — primes sensitization. So the new guidelines pushed safe oral introduction in the first half-year in forms infants can handle, like thinned peanut butter or puffs as opposed to whole nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What followed was evidence-driven public health at its best. The data was strong enough to trigger a policy 180: A 2017 addendum to the guidelines urged parents to &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/addendum-peanut-allergy-prevention-guidelines.pdf"&gt;introduce peanuts between&lt;/a&gt; 4 and 6 months. A &lt;a href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(20)31211-3/abstract"&gt;2021 consensus document&lt;/a&gt; from allergists and immunologists went further, also recommending the introduction of egg and other allergens at the same age. It’s one of those rare times when the science was clear, the guidance became clear, and the desired outcomes followed, as the new study from CHOP demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-new-data-on-food-allergies" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new data on food allergies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The CHOP team mined AAP-affiliated electronic health records to compare results from before and after the updated guidelines. Peanut allergy diagnoses fell from 0.79 percent to 0.45 percent among infants and toddlers, while any IgE-mediated food allergy — an immune reaction to specific food proteins that triggers the release of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which is what drives allergy symptoms — fell from 1.46 percent to 0.93 percent. Notably, peanuts even dropped from the most common allergy culprit to number two, with egg moving to first — exactly what you’d expect given that the AAP’s intervention was initially peanut-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The researchers &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/peanut-allergy-children-infants-anaphylaxis-9a6df6377a622d05e47c340c5a9cffc8"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; the shift has already prevented tens of thousands of cases — on the order of around 40,000 peanut allergies, and some 60,000 food allergies overall — since 2015. That’s a huge payoff for what boils down to something as simple and cheap as giving your 5-month-old the occasional peanut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And there are likely even more gains to be realized, because the adoption of the new allergy guidance has been real but incomplete: Only about 29 percent of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7364336/"&gt;pediatricians reported&lt;/a&gt; fully implementing the 2017 recommendations a couple of years in, with somewhat higher compliance from allergists. The fact we still saw such sharp declines in allergies suggests the effects could be even bigger as awareness spreads among doctors and parents alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Peanut allergies are no joke. They tend to persist for life, they &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-peanut-allergy-be-cured-in-children"&gt;drive a disproportionate share of all severe allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt;, and dealing with them reshapes daily life in everything from school parties to air travel. Preventing even a slice of new cases means fewer EpiPens in backpacks, fewer late-night ER runs, and less of the background anxiety that families of allergic kids know too well. And there’s a real economic dividend: Estimates put the annual US economic burden of &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/food-allergies-cost-us-25-billion-a-year/"&gt;childhood food allergies at around $25 billion&lt;/a&gt;, or around $4,000 per affected child per year. Prevent those allergies from ever developing in the first place, and you lighten that load for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s a broader lesson for health here that goes well beyond allergies. When a large, decisive trial shows an actionable prevention behavior, change the guidance decisively, say it simply, and measure outcomes in the real world. Then close the implementation gap with better clinician prompts, clearer parent handouts, and practical tips for high-risk families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientific expertise is &lt;a href="/future-perfect/461506/make-america-healthy-again-robert-kennedy-vaccines-obesity"&gt;under threat as never before&lt;/a&gt; — and some of that criticism &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-miscalculations-of-covid-small-school-closures"&gt;is warranted&lt;/a&gt;. But If you’re looking for evidence that public health can change its mind in the face of countervailing evidence, here it is, delivered in baby-safe spoonfuls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPcVhuY3dKaWxfcC1wRFp1MUduYVdXc2pvczRhbkFtMElJY0dWOVdkUko2bjJ4Tk5jOGRFQ2N3UkY3MW9SZThUcmxxQ1E2bzVpQkRKMVlyMkhXTEVtSGhpOFlEVTFGLWJZZ2lnZFEydkRLTHlnWXNqS0xsTmJ2NW5EMXkxbGhyZGlTRW5rVXk1YzFtNUpTNGlUblY4VTJNTmw4UkE</guid></item><item><title>马里兰州学校最新的病毒爆发是令人讨厌的，但很少是危险的-巴尔的摩旗帜</title><link>https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-schools-NU2AKZVUQVGO3FC5UNQBZBLNWU/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Itâ€™s that time of year when germs begin to make their way around classrooms. And one yucky, but not particularly dangerous, virus is making extra rounds in Maryland and much of the rest of the country: hand, foot and mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;In the state, there have been 276 outbreaks reported this year as of October 24, a big jump from&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;48 last year and 145 in 2023. There were just 74 in 2022, according to the Maryland Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The outbreaks â€” defined by three or more cases in a seven-day period â€” have been confirmed in day care facilities, schools, camps and other youth-oriented settings, though the disease isnâ€™t limited to just children, according to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;state health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is usually caused by an enterovirus called coxsackievirus A16. Symptoms appear as tiny blisters inside the mouth and on the palms of hands and feet that emerge three to five days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The disease spreads person-to-person, such as when children cough on each other or&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;play with the same toys after touching their mouths or noses. In addition to saliva, the fluid in blisters can also spread the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;While people are most contagious during during the time they feel ill with cold-like symptoms, the virus can spread for weeks. There is no specific treatment, and the disease usually resolves on its own in about seven to 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;In Montgomery County, there has been a considerable rise in cases, with 38 confirmed this year in schools and day care centers, more than four times the numbers for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the same time last year, according to Dr. Nina Ashford, the countyâ€™s public health services chief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;â€œTo prevent the illness, adults and children should wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom or changing a diaper,â€�&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Ashford said. â€œAvoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose and mouth. Additionally, disinfect surfaces such as countertops and toys.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Jon Gonella, a physician assistant specializing in emergency medicine and urgent care for MedStar Health, said in a statement that the illness typically spreads during the fall when children gather for school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Thatâ€™s also true for flu, RSV and COVID-19, though cases of those infections all remain low so far, according to a new &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/Pages/Respiratory-Virus-Surveillance.aspx" target="_self" rel="" title="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/Pages/Respiratory-Virus-Surveillance.aspx"&gt;state health dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.

Children may not want to eat because of mouth pain, so make sure they are hydrated. Use over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Baltimore Banner</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxONlk3WjJlZk1oeGNDd3ZFczkzLUFQY21YTElRa2ZGby1kR1pDcVpTNXhsMjMxVDJST0tISkU5eWVkUUg4U01Wb2hvMzRhMVctWWF2ZHF3UXFRNE9fUkthQk1MeVlNcFQyMXNVZ2pNV2JmTE1SY3M1UHg2cXhmTlpYbUhwUUJTT21EWkdqN2JMVFJ6NFBQMWVXZVNfTVpVRGxDb0otN1ZjNTNLNGxLeWJnOGpsdw</guid></item><item><title>首次录制垂死的人脑显示类似于记忆闪回的波浪（ 2022年） -黑客新闻</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45796421</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 10:27:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE1oRjdOZC1hWjBWWmp2eE9rSUtoOUNWZ2RtZWFhYUotYThldk82eFgtVEhSQVhNZmM4MWpjVjVjN0JycERzX3cxakFBSXk3dFZWa3A3UmRNMmI</guid></item><item><title>Apple Watch数据与人工智能合作揭示心脏损伤-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/4766c95e-9a87-4ec8-9f18-1f54df0ba713</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Access to eight surprising articles a day, hand-picked by FT editors.

But a need to take them on a regular basis to help with falling and staying asleep could be a signal that the body is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beating-insomnia-lower-risk-heart-attack-rcna72016" target="_blank"&gt;experiencing cardiac issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b15016" class="body-graf"&gt;“Insomnia can increase blood pressure, stress hormones and inflammation,” said Dr. Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, lead author of the new study and an internal medicine resident at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi and colleagues looked at five years of electronic health records from 130,828 adults, average age 56, finding that people who took melatonin regularly for at least a year were nearly twice as likely to develop heart failure compared to those who didn’t use the supplement, though the actual rates were relatively low: 4.6% of people in the melatonin group developed heart failure, compared to 2.7% among those who didn’t take melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0249d" class="body-graf"&gt;They were more than three times as likely to be hospitalized for the condition (19% versus 6.6%), and nearly twice as likely to die during the study period, compared to people who didn’t take melatonin regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7706af" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear, however, whether the data captured outcomes of all people in the U.S. who take melatonin long term. Researchers identified people as chronic users of melatonin based on medical records only — that is, if they’d been prescribed the supplement. In the U.S., the supplement is available over the counter and isn’t often reflected in medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f47f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“I caution people against drawing concrete conclusions based on this study alone,” said Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventive cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved with the study. “But now that we have this observation, this is prime time to figure out whether there’s actually a direct association of harm with sleep agents. That would be practice-changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e813e" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi’s research is scheduled to be presented in New Orleans at an upcoming meeting of the American Heart Association. It has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60e9c7" class="body-graf"&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart can’t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body’s organs for them to function properly. Nearly 7 million Americans have the condition, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/heart-failure.html#" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-097025" class="body-graf"&gt;While the study found that long-term melatonin use was an indicator of potential heart problems — and not causing the problems itself — experts agreed more research is needed into the supplements’ possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8b9da" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have patients using all kinds of supplements without understanding the risks,” said Dr. Martha Gulati, a preventive cardiologist and the incoming director of the Davis Women’s Heart Center at Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute in Texas. “If there is harm from a supplement, it means the cost could be far more than simply expensive urine.” Gulati was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f35619" class="body-graf"&gt;Melatonin is a hormone made naturally by the body that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles. Synthetic versions, sold widely over the counter as dietary supplements, are marketed to help people &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/falling-asleep-time-may-safest-heart-new-study-shows-rcna4887" target="_blank"&gt;fall asleep faster&lt;/a&gt; or overcome jet lag. Because supplements aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, doses and purity can vary widely among brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-457ac4" class="body-graf"&gt;Use of the supplement has increased in recent years. A 2022 &lt;a href="http://sleepfoundation.org" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt; found that up to 27% of U.S. adults take melatonin, as well as 4% of kids. The new study &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/reports-melatonin-poisoning-kids-increased-rcna31741" target="_blank"&gt;didn’t include children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c323a7" class="body-graf"&gt;People taking melatonin for sleep for more than a year should talk with their doctor, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d3cf" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“People should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication,” Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, said in a press release.

                Our body is an exquisite time-keeping machine. Every cell that has DNA has a molecular clock, but they don't keep perfect time on their own.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The return to "standard time" is better for our health according to sleep scientists, but the time change can be disruptive, and our bodies must also adjust to more hours of darkness as we head towards winter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The body is an exquisite time-keeping machine. And growing evidence shows that if you align your daily habits with&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1261413416/how-to-optimize-your-circadian-rhythm" target="_blank"&gt; your circadian rhythms &lt;/a&gt;— including when you sleep, eat, and exercise — you can help fend off chronic disease and optimize good health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's start with a quick primer: "Your body is filled with clocks, explains &lt;a href="https://inside.salk.edu/fall-2018/emily-manoogian/" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Manoogian&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher and chronobiologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In addition to the master clock in your brain, there are time-keeping mechanisms in every organ and in your cells.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Every cell in your body that has DNA has a molecular clock that keeps its own time," she says. They're all part of your body's circadian system helping you stay in sync with the 24-hour cycle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But our bodies don't keep perfect time on their own. Every day, we stray a bit from the 24-hour cycle, and need a reset, explains Salk Institute researcher &lt;a href="https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/" target="_blank"&gt;Satchin Panda&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy, and Transform Your Health from Morning to Midnight. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The master clock in your brain coordinates all the other clocks through a series of different cues," Manoogian explains, including external cues — such as light, food, and movement. And that's why the timing of our habits can play a pivotal role in keeping our clocks in sync.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Light from the sun serves as the external cue to resynchronize the master clock. That's why it's helpful to open the blinds in the morning and spend time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, it turns out, our first bite of food each day also works as an external cue to sync the clocks in our digestive system and throughout our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Food is also a signal to reset the clocks, especially your gut," Manoogian says. "That's one of the reasons why making sure you're eating at the right time relative to light is important."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Eating is a cue to wake up your digestive and metabolic organs, which are primed to function best during the day. By nighttime, the metabolic system is ready for rest, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you're asleep, your body expects to fast. And so it shuts down the part of the system that captures glucose from the blood and stores it away," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When people eat too close to bedtime or in the middle of the night, their metabolic organs aren't optimized to do their job. The misalignment can lead to poor blood sugar control. Her research shows that restricting the number of hours you eat during a day to about a 10 hour window, can lead to significant improvements in metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's lots of evidence that eating out of sync with your circadian rhythms can increase the risk of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. Studies show that shift workers who work rotating, overnight&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k4641" target="_blank"&gt; shifts have a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing these conditions due, in part, to the disruption of the natural rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when it comes to exercise, some people find they do best in the morning, others in the afternoon, says&lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=13785" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Phyliss Zee&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. But the science shows exercising late at night, just before bed can disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a peak time for almost every physiological process," Zee says. "The timing of feeding, the time that you exercise, the physical activity, all of these help entrain the clocks in your body so that they're in sync," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you eat dinner and go to bed around the same time most nights, your 'creature of habit' ways could pay off. "The science shows that regularity is very important for the circadian system and for health," Zee says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And while each person is unique she says,  a general rule of thumb is to begin limiting exposure to light, food and heavy exercise starting a few hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But as scientists have learned more about the importance of keeping our biological clocks in sync, society has moved in the opposite direction. Manoogian points to advertisements for midnight food menus, and around the clock work and entertainment as examples of our 24/7 modern life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One way to push back is to track your daily habits. Michelle Pittsley, who lives in Vista, Calif., started using an app called &lt;a href="https://www.mycircadianclock.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;myCircadianClock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to log her eating and blood sugar. She says it helped her stick to a "time-restricted eating" window and helped her track her progress. The app was developed by Salk scientists as a research tool, and is used in Salk Institute studies. It's free to any adult who downloads it. The app provides guidance on when to sleep, eat, and exercise. (Note: if you sign up, you're sharing data with researchers.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When we have "broken" circadian rhythms, the risk for chronic disease rises, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, gut diseases and common cancers, say Panda and Manoogian. If you want to be more intentional about aligning your habits for better health, here are three strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Drop the late night snack, and limit the hours you eat.&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who restrict their eating to a ten hour window can reduce their risk of Type 2 diabetes, Manoogian says. She and Panda co-authored a study of 108 adults, average age 59, who had symptoms of metabolic disease. They found those who followed time-restricted eating saw a significant &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39348690/" target="_blank"&gt;reduction in their hemoglobin A1c&lt;/a&gt; (which is a person's average glucose level over a few months), compared to participants who did not restrict their eating window.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Participants were not asked to reduce calories, only to restrict the eating window for a period of three months.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was exciting to see that just the time restricted eating was able to reduce their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 60%," Manoogian says, because the reduction in blood sugar, if maintained, reduces the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research also suggests that eating your biggest meal of the day in the afternoon, as opposed to later in the evening can be beneficial for those who want to lose weight. A study from Spain found &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/01/30/170591028/to-maximize-weight-loss-eat-early-in-the-day-not-late" target="_blank"&gt;early eaters lost 25 percent more weight&lt;/a&gt; than late eaters. Panda says when his mother gave up a late night snack that included tea with sugar and milk and an occasional snack, that one change led to a significant drop in her blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Go to bed about the same time most nights &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Keeping the same sleep schedule is optimal," Manoogian says. The consistency gives your body a chance to anticipate and keep internal clocks synchronized. During sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/26/g-s1-6177/brain-waste-removal-system-amyloid-alzheimer-toxins" target="_blank"&gt;waste is cleared out of our brains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sleeps-crucial-role-in-preserving-memory/" target="_blank"&gt;memories are consolidated&lt;/a&gt;, and there's a pile of evidence to show rest is critical for our health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But don't beat yourself up when you have a late night out. And of course, there will be disruptions due to travel, work deadlines or weekend celebrations. "Going off your circadian system is not like breaking an arm," Manoogian says. Think of the harms of erratic schedules akin to the way dripping water can erode stone. "Little hits, time after time, can wear down the system," she says. And the result is you can feel slower and older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/20/705224709/dont-count-sheep-better-bedtime-rituals" target="_blank"&gt; lots of bedtime rituals&lt;/a&gt; to foster a good night's sleep, including limiting light before bed and sleeping in darkness. Zee's research shows &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/04/01/1089997121/light-disrupts-sleep#:~:text=Unlike%20those%20who%20spent%20both,night%20could%20disturb%20our%20metabolism" target="_blank"&gt;even small amounts of light&lt;/a&gt; while sleeping  can have adverse effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Time exercise to your 'sweet spot,' but not too late at night &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Whether you're a morning lark or a night owl can influence the ideal time for you to exercise, so this will vary from person to person, Zee says. "The better time to exercise depends, in part, on what we call your chronotype," she says, which is a person's innate preference for timing of sleep or when they feel more alert and energetic. One way to estimate your tendency is with a &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbti/assets/user-content/documents/Morningness-Eveningness%20Questionnaire.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Morningness-Eveningness&lt;/a&gt; questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're a morning person, then morning exercise can be beneficial," creating a consistent structure, Zee says, but people who grow more alert later in the day, may want to put it off until later. As people juggle competing obligations, exercise may be shoehorned into the time it fits on your calendar, even if it's not your body clock's preferred window. She says it's important to remember that exercise is beneficial, no matter what time you do it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But keep this in mind: "Exercise is a stimulatory cue to tell your body you should be awake," Manoogian says, so it's not a surprise that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x" target="_blank"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that exercise just before sleep can &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-bed-linked-disrupted.html#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;disrupt sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNT3M3cFBnaFE2UkhBVUhmNFROV0xZTEZRajVEbzl3T1NDeUNsVXVaby1kYXhxX0ZPM3VxeHl5eVkwbzFGVjEzM05LWjJTbUk4WXF6NzMzU2ZXRTA1RGFpbktIT2R1b2dnWFNYbVpMWDZjUEl1Q2h6bDZWUGYxYXU2ZzVXNmFJQkxxWW16UHRkbnA</guid></item><item><title>以加拿大为首的美洲即将失去麻疹根除地位- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/03/measles-elimination-status-canada-united-states-mexico/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas — North, Central, and South — is the only region of the world that has ever managed to stop endemic transmission of measles. But that hard-won victory against the highly contagious virus is on the verge of being rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week an expert committee of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is meeting in Mexico City to study measles transmission data from the region. Canada’s massive — by contemporary standards — and long-running measles outbreak is almost certain to trigger a finding that the country’s, and thus the entire region’s, status as having eliminated measles has been lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though largely symbolic, losing measles elimination status will smart for the country, which had stopped ongoing measles transmission for more than a quarter century. Canada was declared measles free in 1998; the United States followed two years later, in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps a remote chance the committee — known as the regional verification commission for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome — will need additional data before reaching a conclusion. But two things are quite clear: The Canadian outbreak, though slowing dramatically, has not stopped, and the virus strain associated with this outbreak has now been transmitting in Canada for more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s still going on,” Natasha Crowcroft, Canada’s acting chief public health officer, told STAT in an interview last week. “We’re not surprised by that. It’s obviously disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Measles-free countries are always at risk of having the virus introduced from elsewhere, in a sick tourist or traveler; that alone does not lead to the loss of measles elimination status. But if such a spark ignites a chain of transmission that extends for 12 months, the virus is considered to be endemic, meaning the country is no longer deemed to be measles-free. Loss of measles elimination status in one country in a region results in the entire region losing elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel Salas, executive manager of the special program for comprehensive immunization at PAHO, didn’t want to prejudge the commission’s deliberations. “We’re going to listen to what Canada is going to show, all the evidence, all the research that they have done, investigations of cases and all of that,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But experts who have been following the situation and understand the complexities of controlling measles outbreaks believe the writing is on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would say elimination status for the region is probably at risk,” said Paul Rota, who retired as chief of the viral vaccine-preventable diseases branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in May, and who serves on the regional verification commission for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella for the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific region. (PAHO is one of the WHO’s six regional offices.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s my expectation of the outcome of that meeting, unfortunately,” Sarah Wilson, deputy chief of communicable diseases control at Public Health Ontario, told STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly 2,400 measles&lt;/a&gt; cases this year, all but 54 of which were part of the ongoing national outbreak. Ontario believes transmission there has stopped; its outbreak was declared over on Oct. 6.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Canada overall has recorded more than &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/#a21" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;5,100 confirmed and probable measles&lt;/a&gt; cases in 2025, and two deaths of babies born with congenital measles who were infected in utero. The country hasn’t seen this scale of measles transmission in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s tremendously disappointing,” said Lynora Saxinger, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Alberta. “I never in my life thought I’d see a massive measles outbreak in Canada. Most of my career in [infectious diseases], there’s been 10 cases a year or less.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in October 2024, when someone infected abroad attended a wedding in New Brunswick, in eastern Canada. From there, the virus has spread across nine of Canada’s 10 provinces and to the Northwest Territories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saxinger is not alone in being surprised by the size of the outbreak, though details of where infections are happening help to put the number of cases and the vast geographic spread into context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like the measles outbreak earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/"&gt;in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the lion’s share of the Canadian cases have occurred among members of close-knit religious communities that eschew contact with the wider world — homeschooling their children and seeking medical care only if it’s urgently needed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials have been hesitant to name the groups, for fear of further alienating them and undermining efforts to gain their help to control spread. But &lt;a href="https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/professionals-and-partners/resources/Documents/CMOH-Measles-Memorandum-to-PHU_2025-03-07_Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a memo&lt;/a&gt; to Ontario medical officers of health last spring, the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Kieran Moore reported that cases were being disproportionately seen in Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this has been one of the challenges of this outbreak,” Wilson said. It’s been “a bit of a balancing act between communication about where the outbreak is occurring, the populations at risk, but balancing that with a very real risk of stigmatization of communities. And especially communities in which local public health units are really trying to … build and regain trust.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many members of these communities, which are found in pockets across the country, are under-vaccinated or unvaccinated. There had been no cases of measles reported within these communities in Ontario since before Canada achieved measles elimination status in 1998, Wilson said, meaning the pool of susceptible people was large and included adults as well as children. That has been evidenced by the fact that 51 of Ontario’s cases were in pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilson said she’s seen some people try to characterize the outbreak as a post-Covid phenomenon — driven by the decline in uptake of vaccines for a variety of illnesses that multiple countries have reported in the wake of the pandemic. But she said in this case, the conditions were years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It really predates Covid by not just many years [but] many decades when you look at the ages impacted,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rota agreed, noting the same is true of the West Texas outbreak, and a large outbreak in northern Mexico. All three of these outbreaks are believed to be linked. Combined, they have resulted in 28 measles deaths so far this year: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In some respect, the susceptibility that’s causing the outbreaks now has actually been there for a while, because these are really being fueled by these under-vaccinated populations,” he said. “They’ve been vulnerable for a while. And … the virus got there.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar outbreaks have occurred in the region in the past. In 2014, there was a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27705270/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large outbreak&lt;/a&gt; among Amish communities in Ohio. An outbreak among orthodox Jewish communities in New York City and nearby counties that started in 2018 brought the United States &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/04/measles-outbreaks-put-u-s-at-risk-of-losing-prized-elimination-status/"&gt;perilously close&lt;/a&gt; to losing elimination status in the autumn of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should the Americas lose measles elimination status as a result of this week’s meeting, it won’t be for the first time. The region was first declared measles free in 2016, but &lt;a href="https://journal.paho.org/en/articles/comprehensive-approach-achieving-reverification-measles-elimination-venezuela-2019-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a large outbreak in Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; erased that accomplishment in 2018. Brazil lost its elimination status the following year. Venezuela proved to the regional verification commission that it had stopped endemic spread in 2023. Brazil followed in 2024, allowing the Americas to again claim measles elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the current outbreak is extinguished in Canada, the country could regain its measles-free status if it can show the regional verification commission that it has gone 12 months without endemic transmission. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crowcroft, who is also the vice president for infectious diseases and vaccination programs at the Public Health Agency of Canada, thinks the end of the Canadian outbreak is in sight. “We’re pretty confident … we’re at the tail end of it.” But as a former member of PAHO’s regional verification commission, she knows that regaining elimination status isn’t a simple process. It’s not enough to claim that transmission has stopped. A country must show that its surveillance systems are robust enough to detect chains of transmission, if they are occurring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked if she’s worried about the message that could be sent because a country as affluent as Canada couldn’t stop transmission within a year, Crowcroft reframed the question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m more concerned … that we learn the lessons of this being a reflection of the global situation, and how much we do depend on each other,” she said. “Whether high income, low income, or middle income, wherever, we’re all dependent on each other to get ahead of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saxinger sees the milestone as a call to action. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a big wake-up call. I think we’ve been coasting on luck during a period of drifting vaccine rates for quite a long time now,” she said. “The fact that it’s been really, really difficult to control is just a solid reminder that measles is just really, really hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
