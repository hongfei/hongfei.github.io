She watched patients die alone and missed her son's birthday out of fear of becoming infected and bringing the virus home with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2021, Covid vaccines became available and, feeling a sense of duty to protect her patients, she took the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-cdcb3010-f3aa-11ef-8125-0bb3f6a87bc2"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She experienced no immediate side effects, but in July 2021, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14418267/Vaccine-victims-left-disabled-taking-Covid-jab-react-bombshell-Yale-study-shots-cause-extreme-body-changes.html"&gt;Mrs Burnette developed 'unbearable' pain&lt;/a&gt; in both of her hips. She was told she had arthritis at 31 years old and had to use a wheelchair when the pain made it too hard to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing her pain was something else, another doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed Mrs Burnette's hip bones were literally rotting, and she underwent her first hip replacement in December 2021. The second followed a few months later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, her hips were just the beginning. Over the next nearly four years - and still ongoing today - Mrs Burnette would undergo surgeries on both shoulders and knees, three surgeries on her elbow, one on her left foot and she is scheduled to have another procedure on her right foot next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after her ordeal began, one of her doctors attributed her complications to her bout of Covid in late November 2020 and subsequent vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brittany Burnette lives in Tennessee with her husband and two sons (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com: 'The pain is so debilitating. I have never felt so helpless in my entire life. I've always been trying to be the best provider I could be caring for other people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, due to Mrs Burnette's condition, she had to quit her job as a nurse and director in an elder care home and go on disability.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Now I can't even drive my kids to school in the morning anymore... it's devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have really had to mourn the life that I thought I was going to have because I will no longer be able to be the same person I've always wanted to be because of a virus and a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette, now 34, used to be a nurse and director in a nursing home but has had to go on disability because of her medical complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's absolutely destroyed my life, and so I've had to just totally sit back and reevaluate everything.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like thousands of Americans who suffered injuries shortly after getting their Covid vaccine, Mrs Burnette attributes her ailments to the shot. But a lack of research and evidence has left vaccine victims without answers, lacking support and being cast as anti-vaxxers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, last week, a small Yale University study offered some support to victims' stories as experts discovered a previously-unknown condition - dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition also appears to reawaken a dormant virus in the body called Epstein-Barr, which can cause flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes and nerve issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette's symptoms don't match all of those mentioned in the research - she has experienced nerve complications - the researchers said vaccine injuries can manifest differently from patient to patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com she remains a supporter of vaccines and she and her children have all received routine shots, but she is hesitant to get new ones going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the hardest things about her complications is the impact it has on her as a mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette's pain is so severe she is often reliant on a wheelchair to get around&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'I worry every day that I'm going to cause [my sons] to have stress and anxiety when they're older but they have made me feel so strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel like, if anything, this just made them so much more compassionate. They are always always there no matter what, at my back to take care of me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My 10 year old has really stepped up and my husband, he works very hard for us, especially with me losing [my job]. He's really been an amazing caretaker and taken over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just don't know if I would have made it. They are the reason I keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to her vaccine, Mrs Burnette had been living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - thickening of the heart muscle - but her condition was well managed under the care of a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her new symptoms began, she has seen doctors across multiple specialties, including orthopedics and a geneticist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website her geneticist attributes her complications to a combination of her Covid infection and the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor, Mrs Burnette said, told her when she received the vaccine it prompted an immune response and her body sent out thousands of clots that cut off the blood supply to her bones and joints and cause them to collapse and die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of Mrs Burnette's other doctors believe she has the autoimmune diseases either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but diagnostic tests have come back negative or inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette has undergone three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve (left) and has had both of her knees replaced (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has been diagnosed with multifocal avascular necrosis (AVN), also called multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AVN is a condition in which bones throughout the body lose their blood supply, causing them to die. It can be caused by trauma to the body, like broken or fractured bones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2023/09000/avascular_necrosis_of_femoral_head_following.5.aspx"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;in the journal Annals of Medicine and Surgery investigated the relationship of avascular necrosis (AVN) and Covid infection in 17 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found 82 percent of patients complained of pain in both hips, leading nearly 18 percent to undergo total hip replacements and they concluded 'there is a risk of developing AVN after Covid-19.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no published research on the connection between AVN and Covid vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandson Crawford, a functional neurologist who is not involved in Mrs Burnette's care, told DailyMail.com AVN can be triggered by inflammation and blood clotting abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These, Dr Crawford said, have been documented both in severe Covid cases and post-vaccination adverse reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Given that Covid-19 is known to affect the vascular system and trigger inflammatory responses, it is plausible that a vaccine administered soon after an infection could further exacerbate these effects, particularly in individuals with underlying predispositions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette is pictured above receiving her Covid vaccine in January 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her hip replacements, Mrs Burnette has also undergone a partial left shoulder replacement in September 2022 and had three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve in January 2023, August 2024 and November 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent a right knee replacement in August 2023, a partial right shoulder replacement in May 2023, a left knee replacement in February 2023 and in July 2023 her left heel broke and had to be surgically repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette will undergo surgery in the next few weeks to repair another fracture in her right foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Even though I have had all of these replacements and surgeries I am still in constant deep bone pain every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It isn't as bad as bone death pain but some days are still unbearable. The pain is so bad some days it takes everything I have to get out of bed and move, let alone be a mother and wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Doctors] think I will likely suffer with bone pain for the rest of my life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only has she had to cope with AVN, her doctors said the infection and vaccine triggered a 'domino effect' in her body, leading to blood clots in her lungs, declining kidney function, sepsis and pleurisy - inflammation of the lining in the lungs and chest cavity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is an x-ray showing Mrs Burnette's double hip replacements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In an alternative effort to treat her ailments, doctors have prescribed chemotherapy and immunotherapy infusions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I'm not going to tell you I haven't had dark, scary days and struggle, because I have... without my family and God, I just don't know. That's just what kept me going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette believes in vaccines, when she first started speaking out about her experience with the Covid shot, she said she was met with people questioning whether she was an anti-vaxxer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mrs Burnette has always been pro-vaccine and she and her children received all the recommended shots. Now, however, she is extremely wary of new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website she will never get or give her children another Covid vaccine, but has no problem getting them routine vaccinations of shots that have been around and researched for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette said: 'I did everything that I needed to do, vaccinating my children. I was vaccinated, but, I will never get another flu shot or COVID vaccine, and I won't give my kids either as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They will get... the other ones that have been well studied and researched, and there's lots of information on over the years. I just think that newer vaccines, before mandated, need to be researched because these are people's lives that it's destroying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPUlV0ZUFzQzJmaEpZd0MybVdUSURmSXM2WTBHNDRSZnVBaENTbmdKbkd6Wkh0cU5ESnVYOXdhZThpLVEtTll5MFpTMXNqZ3luT2tKSlM2N0FNZ3ZLSUxiVmVZMjg0RnQ5WWNpOGFzWmJGYndWUHJ5UFdmbmZiODVEeG13Vmp1cHpobUo4MkhDb1VBVThoMjViclZxX3g4TmdJaG9xRW14WFk5M3ROZXfSAbMBQVVfeXFMUE52X1BRTDdUSGpFZ3JMbGNDVnlhSTZ4NHNPMWlDc2lDVGdSUV9MUy1EMmc1bmFMN3lvMGVNMVJUV3p2dWJ1UFFPb0NYT3pkTG1fYmYyazdha01IejB6M0RDMGoxbEZuQnNnZnc0ZFdDNko0QUR0VHNDV2xwMnAzQzJzblFYS2taSmlFYlV5ejBuZXd5SDVFMVVjRC13WXNIUnA4RkhuTWNJWDRkMWZCNWN2NlU</guid></item><item><title>Over 50 deaths linked to 'unknown disease' in Congo - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNYWE0MTE3eHpyOG8ybGtNYVNkb1R3ZnpDT0ZQWEdSbEhfY24tMkE4UDFnVmI3U3AwNDdLNlNTOEJqVzJ3cUtMNmFwNW8tVGNnbFRnNkgtWDVmdVJRd05IeG5HbThHbUJNeTVldWxXZWdDVGhJVXlZX2JpMk52ZFFncW5JWGV6Tkw0dnZF0gGQAUFVX3lxTE1TM2VsTm5fV2FMLUVFRmVCQ1pNQm1icU9uYVptSDZrNXVKSGRPVmNQNkRzS3drZEVBbWxrSEZLaF9GZXE5Q21CcVZRZW1FV3ZPbmNBNnA3RHJYMW1QelAxcW5xMkFJT3pvSmNJTFVRREdnVTlkTXp0S0NQek9KZUV2RnJpWVMxMGM0N0s2T3Jpag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The World Health Organization has reported that there is a deadly "unknown disease" spreading in one region within the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Local health officials in Congo are partnering with the World Health Organization to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A general view of the World Health Organization (WHO) on April 28, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Harold Cunningham/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The phrase "unknown disease" primarily means that the disease has not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In previous cases, the cases are linked to a known disease, but a lack of available testing leads to lack of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, there was a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/undiagnosed-disease-congo-linked-malaria-africa-cdc/story?id=116939557" target="_blank"&gt;separate report&lt;/a&gt;

That means painstakingly tracking down anyone who was in those public spaces at the same time — or several hours afterward — to tell them about the exposure and give guidance on what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That’s on top of the ongoing investigations in the outbreak’s epicenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My biggest concern right now is the manpower needed to do all of the contact tracing,” said Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and health authority for the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re managing right now, but if this grows any bigger, we’re going to need some more help.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 23:06:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPc0NWOEN0QjVQQ01FVkFfQ0dIR2UxVXN1SWdEUDlmSnZDU00xRkkzNWNzb0lRWWVQTXpELXdfN251aXc5SGxoZHhFWHpDV05EYzU5S1ZkTm1ITlZWM3V2ZGMxT240alpielVYaXgxaHNMcWY5Zi05SWtxcnR3aDk5d3RLR29lVzE2X0lJVGllY1pzRnI2NlMzc2hIVDI3S2hYVUHSAVZBVV95cUxNYlFxYnpDNktob1pQbzJSV2FIZFRoenN6MnJISDR0TXNHdlRSQlFFcDlUbVY5dmJ4MkM1Q2pqXzY4aE9UaUpwd2NsY0d6N09aMlRFazQ1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Brain surgery took all my childhood memories - will i forget my fiance after second op? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAyRXZ6dUl4eDFraUFtMXlIRGNrMkdlTGVRRlBwenJndkxON0tDV1cwQmJncW4yUDJEYlJhZzJ6TW0yV3lVcUJwT2tucFE5ZkdfRU5na2xPLVZmUdIBX0FVX3lxTFAxVk9peWJtREQ3LWFDWWlFU0VrYXFNUF9qVTRUZmFiTUd1TlZnQzlxbU1ZOEUya2dwMGxaRmFLY1dfc0IxUmpxa1ZRYnY2RXM1YXM5UTZjbWRxalNKaHBv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 bWszMR"&gt;Brain surgery took my childhood memories - will new op make me forget my fiance?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 khDNZq"&gt;Debbie Jackson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 jtKrhe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Scotland News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-4 cVwCpL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp" alt="Weronika Somerville Weronika takes a selfie on a country lane, with a path leading off behind her and hedges on her right side, a row of trees on her left.

            Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China have discovered a new lineage of a coronavirus in bats that can enter human cells in a similar fashion as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a recently published study. But there are no reported infections in humans, and experts say it’s not currently a threat to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0005336mydd5hlr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like SARS-CoV-2, HKU5-CoV-2 can enter cells via the human ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces. The newly identified coronavirus is a part of the same family as the virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that causes deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0006336mjct6j2dz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the study, published last week in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425001448%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, scientists found the coronavirus in anal swab samples taken from a bat of the genus Pipistrellus. A lab experiment showed that the virus could infect human cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfg8p0000336m4og41alu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pointing to the fact that researchers have not detected any infections in humans, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an email to CNN that it was aware of the publication “but there is no reason to believe it currently poses a concern to public health.” The CDC added that it “will continue to monitor viral disease activity and provide important updates to the public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0007336maew2jupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists say the newly identified coronavirus doesn’t&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infect cells as efficiently as the virus that causes Covid-19. But with the work originating at the Wuhan, China, lab that’s been the target of questions about where Covid-19 originated, it quickly captured attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0008336mj036donw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the new research contains some pandemic-associated trigger words, Dr. Amira Roess said there is no reason for concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0009336mcwwfis2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even the researchers themselves point out that this should not cause panic,” said Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University’s College of Public Health who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has worked with international colleagues to better understand the MERS coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000a336mmq2ium3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this study is important, Roess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000b336mho8jktqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It helps us understand what happens in the event that this does spill over and pose a risk. It’s good to get ahead of that,” she said. “The more we know about these viruses, the better.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000e336mdbjludpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In experiments, antiviral medications that worked against SARS-CoV-2 also seemed to be active against the newly named coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000c336m8uho3xg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington Medical Center, who developed tests to detect Covid-19 early in the pandemic, described nature as “the best bioterrorist” but also agreed that people shouldn’t be alarmed about the newly identified&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coronavirus – or even surprised that scientists found it in bats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000d336me4dxq8ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are probably a lot of coronaviruses circulating in bats that can enter human cells,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000f336msldtthga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If people want to worry, Greninger said, they can worry about the other coronaviruses that are endemic and making people sick right now. The viruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032340181400222X" target="_blank"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; the common cold. They give most people only minor respiratory issues, but such infections can also develop into pneumonia or croup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000g336mo1etjujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re here every winter, so frankly, we should be talking about those rather than HKU5,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000h336mrp6272x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phoebe Lostroh, author of “Molecular and Cellular Biology of Viruses,” said headlines about how this newly named coronavirus could cause the next pandemic are overblown and “not helpful,” particularly when there is already fear in the world about the US withdrawing from global health efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000i336mo1o5xowy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we ought to be a lot more worried about problems like avian flu and its impact on cows and kitties and all sorts of other mammals than this new coronavirus that was isolated from a population of bats in China that reminds us of SARS-CoV-2 but is not really a breakthrough discovery,” said Lostroh, an associate professor of molecular biology at Colorado College.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000j336mui5ho26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roess said the study highlights why scientists collaborate globally to monitor and understand viruses that have the potential to hurt human health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000k336m3jrxq9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s sad to think about how we’re separating ourselves from the global public health world,” she said. Under President Donald Trump, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;US is withdrawing&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization and has ceased support of health programs through USAID. “This highlights to me why it’s so important to do global work and to do these global collaborations over the long haul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study should also serve as a reminder to the public to be careful around wildlife like bats, Roess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There’s other things that bats carry that can be very problematic for people,” she said. “So respect these wild animals, don’t interact with them too much, because you could end up hurting them and yourself.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfek400la2dp9gao36r9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China have discovered a new lineage of a coronavirus in bats that can enter human cells in a similar fashion as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a recently published study. But there are no reported infections in humans, and experts say it’s not currently a threat to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0005336mydd5hlr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like SARS-CoV-2, HKU5-CoV-2 can enter cells via the human ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces. The newly identified coronavirus is a part of the same family as the virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that causes deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0006336mjct6j2dz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the study, published last week in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425001448%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, scientists found the coronavirus in anal swab samples taken from a bat of the genus Pipistrellus. A lab experiment showed that the virus could infect human cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfg8p0000336m4og41alu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pointing to the fact that researchers have not detected any infections in humans, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an email to CNN that it was aware of the publication “but there is no reason to believe it currently poses a concern to public health.” The CDC added that it “will continue to monitor viral disease activity and provide important updates to the public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0007336maew2jupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists say the newly identified coronavirus doesn’t&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infect cells as efficiently as the virus that causes Covid-19. But with the work originating at the Wuhan, China, lab that’s been the target of questions about where Covid-19 originated, it quickly captured attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0008336mj036donw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the new research contains some pandemic-associated trigger words, Dr. Amira Roess said there is no reason for concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0009336mcwwfis2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even the researchers themselves point out that this should not cause panic,” said Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University’s College of Public Health who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has worked with international colleagues to better understand the MERS coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000a336mmq2ium3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this study is important, Roess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000b336mho8jktqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It helps us understand what happens in the event that this does spill over and pose a risk. It’s good to get ahead of that,” she said. “The more we know about these viruses, the better.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000e336mdbjludpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In experiments, antiviral medications that worked against SARS-CoV-2 also seemed to be active against the newly named coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000c336m8uho3xg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington Medical Center, who developed tests to detect Covid-19 early in the pandemic, described nature as “the best bioterrorist” but also agreed that people shouldn’t be alarmed about the newly identified&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coronavirus – or even surprised that scientists found it in bats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000d336me4dxq8ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are probably a lot of coronaviruses circulating in bats that can enter human cells,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000f336msldtthga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If people want to worry, Greninger said, they can worry about the other coronaviruses that are endemic and making people sick right now. The viruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032340181400222X" target="_blank"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; the common cold. They give most people only minor respiratory issues, but such infections can also develop into pneumonia or croup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000g336mo1etjujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re here every winter, so frankly, we should be talking about those rather than HKU5,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000h336mrp6272x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phoebe Lostroh, author of “Molecular and Cellular Biology of Viruses,” said headlines about how this newly named coronavirus could cause the next pandemic are overblown and “not helpful,” particularly when there is already fear in the world about the US withdrawing from global health efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000i336mo1o5xowy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we ought to be a lot more worried about problems like avian flu and its impact on cows and kitties and all sorts of other mammals than this new coronavirus that was isolated from a population of bats in China that reminds us of SARS-CoV-2 but is not really a breakthrough discovery,” said Lostroh, an associate professor of molecular biology at Colorado College.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000j336mui5ho26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roess said the study highlights why scientists collaborate globally to monitor and understand viruses that have the potential to hurt human health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000k336m3jrxq9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s sad to think about how we’re separating ourselves from the global public health world,” she said. Under President Donald Trump, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;US is withdrawing&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization and has ceased support of health programs through USAID. “This highlights to me why it’s so important to do global work and to do these global collaborations over the long haul.”

This was unique to citrus—meaning, data didn’t establish the same link with other fruits or vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;When researchers drilled down even more, they found that the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii)&lt;/em&gt;, which is found in the gut microbiome of people who eat citrus fruits, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;was more abundant in people who weren't depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“These data underscore the role of diet in the prevention of depression, and offer a plausible explanation for how the intestinal microbiome modulates the influence of citrus on mental health,” the researchers wrote in their conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-eoj2tz e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More On Depression From WH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-gut-bacteria-influence-your-mental-health" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does gut bacteria influence your mental health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The bacteria in your gut, a.k.a. your gut microbiome, play a “crucial role” in your mental health by influencing the production of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that help cells “talk” to each other), bodily inflammation, and the integrity of your gut barrier, says Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Certain gut bacteria, like &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt;, contribute to the gut-brain axis, a bi-directional communication system between the gut and the brain,” Keatley says. This particular bacteria is especially important because it can help to reduce inflammation, he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Since chronic inflammation has been linked to depression, increasing &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; in the gut [by way of consuming citrus] may help regulate mood by reducing inflammatory markers,” Keatley says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, while the gut-brain relationship is firmly established, the way this pathway actually functions on a cellular level is still being explored. “We don’t fully understand the pathways between gut health and depression,” says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1003153511/thea-gallagher" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1003153511/thea-gallagher" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thea Gallagher" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Thea Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, a clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health and cohost of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576255&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmind-in-view%2Fid1544156706" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mind-in-view/id1544156706" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mind in View" data-vars-ga-product-id="c4e65a11-aeb3-48ca-8d73-4ea4e3ef3e9c" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mind-in-view/id1544156706" data-product-url="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mind-in-view/id1544156706" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576255&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmind-in-view%2Fid1544156706" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/rqPd/apple-id1544156706-mind-in-view-podcast","site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="podcasts.apple.com" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="6d3fa7c0-3755-486e-95ad-707c359939c9" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="podcasts.apple.com" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;Mind in View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; podcast. “But we do know there’s something there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-atzu3h emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many oranges do you have to eat to see benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This particular study found that eating one medium orange a day could help lower your risk of depression.

But she also suggests focusing on an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="80/20 style of eating" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;80/20 style of eating&lt;/a&gt;, where you try to eat healthy 80 percent of the time and are more lenient with what you eat for the other 20 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Keatley also suggests consuming fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kimchi" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, and kefir, which have probiotics that can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain, along with nut and seeds, which provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and enhance gut-brain communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Legumes, fatty fish, and leafy green vegetables may also help, per Keatley. “Together, these foods create a diet that supports gut health, reduces systemic inflammation, and enhances neurotransmitter balance, all of which contribute to lowering the risk of depression,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-17" data-node-id="32" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-eoj2tz e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More From WH On Your Gut And Microbiomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-this-effect-compare-to-antidepressant-medications" data-node-id="33" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this effect compare to antidepressant medications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Well, this study specifically looked at preventing depression. Antidepressants are usually used to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt; depression, Gallagher points out. So, it’s not clear, based on these findings, how eating oranges when you already have depression may impact your symptoms or treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But this is important: “Don’t go off your medications and start eating oranges,” Gallagher says. Saltz agrees. "I would not advise anyone based on this study to in any way consider oranges a treatment for clinical major depression," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, Gallagher calls the findings “exciting” for mental health. “This is something that you could easily implement in your diet and probably should regardless,” she says. “It’s accessible, and that’s always a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

			&lt;p&gt;The skulls of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/famous-viking-runestone-linked-to-fears-of-climate-change-says-study"&gt;Viking-age Swedes&lt;/a&gt;, dated between the 10th and 12th centuries, suggest the population of the time was suffering from a wide variety of ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Gothenburg and Västergötlands Museum in Sweden analyzed the human remains using modern computed tomography (CT) scans and found evidence of mouth diseases, jaw joint damage, sinus and ear infections, tooth decay, osteoarthritis, and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was much to look at," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; odontologist Carolina Bertilsson, from the University of Gothenburg. "We found many signs of disease in these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exactly why we don't know. While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153142" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153142" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan.jpg" alt="Skull scan" class="wp-image-153142 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153142" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The skulls were put through a CT scanner.

The skulls were taken from adults who died between the ages of 24 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan"&gt;CT scans&lt;/a&gt; – which are precise types of X-ray scans, taken in three dimensions – the researchers saw damage to both the surface and the interior of the skulls, and they mapped that damage to probable causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153144" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage.jpg" alt="Skull damage" class="wp-image-153144 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage-396x415.jpg 396w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage-600x629.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153144" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A variety of types of skull damage were discovered. (Bertilsson et al., &lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a demonstration of just how much valuable information can be revealed by these types of scans on these kinds of remains, giving us a better idea of how these people lived, back when there were far fewer treatments for pain and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone knows what it's like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But back then, they didn't have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief – and antibiotics – we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the research team behind this study had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-studied-3000-viking-teeth-and-discovered-surprisingly-advanced-dentistry"&gt;previously looked&lt;/a&gt; at teeth recovered from the same site, finding extensive evidence of tooth decay and even some rudimentary attempts at dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been ongoing at the Varnhem site &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/new-excavations-in-varnhem"&gt;for decades now&lt;/a&gt;. It's a significant religious landmark, once the largest church in Sweden, and is the resting place for three Swedish kings from the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that applying their CT scan approach to other ancient remains could reveal all kinds of new discoveries that wouldn't be spotted with a normal visual inspection – and without causing unnecessary damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Very many of today's archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bertilsson. "This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These are two highly fatal diseases among humans that are believed to spread to people through fruit bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the overall case fatality rate is 12.3%, the rate is 66.7% in one of two outbreak areas, where eight of the 12 cases have resulted in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease’s emergence follows three children, all under the age of 5, dying between Jan. 10 and 13 after developing a fever, headache, diarrhea and fatigue. These symptoms, reported in the same village around Bolomba, then turned into hemorrhaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reports indicate that the children had consumed a bat carcass prior to onset of signs and symptom,” health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after those illnesses emerged, four additional children in the same village, between the ages of 5 and 18, came down with similar symptoms.

              &lt;p&gt;New research out this month showcases the ever-present danger posed by coronaviruses, the family of viruses that gave rise to the covid-19 pandemic. Scientists in China have reportedly found a new coronavirus in bats that may be capable of spilling over and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. In lab experiments, the virus appeared to possess a key adaptation that allows it to infect a broad range of mammals, humans included. Other factors are present that make the virus less suited to humans for now, but the scientists say their discovery highlights the importance of studying these sorts of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coronaviruses are a broad group of viruses that infect mammals and birds, seven of which are known to infect humans. Four of these viruses usually cause a mild cold; one caused a major but short-lived epidemic in the early 2000s (the original SARS virus); another causes MERS, a dangerous but limited zoonotic disease that typically spreads from camels to humans; and SARS-CoV-2—the recently discovered coronavirus that caused the worst pandemic seen in a century, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#:~:text=The%20Economist%20built,COVID%2D19.19"&gt;killing upwards of 20 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide since appearing in late 2019. Though covid-19 is substantially less deadly now, thanks in large part to vaccines, it still &lt;a href="https://x.com/BNOFeed/status/1893852906765295894"&gt;routinely kills&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of Americans weekly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even before the arrival of covid-19, scientists have long worried about the risk of coronaviruses sparking the next big outbreak, given how widespread they are across the animal kingdom. In 2006, researchers in Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7111821/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a coronavirus in pipistrelle bats that became known as HKU5-CoV. The discovery was valuable, even if the virus itself didn’t seem to possess the machinery needed to infect humans easily. But the Wuhan scientists say they have now discovered a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoV more capable of jumping over to humans, which they’ve dubbed HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the lab, the researchers found evidence that HKU5-CoV-2 could potentially infect a wide range of mammals. It does so by interacting with a protein receptor found in many types of cells, called ACE2. For those who kept up with pandemic-era science, ACE2 is the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 hacks to infect our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mammals have slightly different versions of ACE2 from one another, and it’s no guarantee that a bat-infecting coronavirus can bind to the human version of ACE2. But the team’s work found that strains of HKU5-CoV-2 could “efficiently” use human ACE2 (and other mammalian versions of ACE2) to enter cells. HKU5-CoV-2 is more closely related to the MERS virus than SARS-CoV-2 and the researchers also found evidence that antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 may offer little protection against HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These findings, however, do not mean that HKU5-CoV-2 is destined to become the next covid. Importantly, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported to date. And even if a virus can theoretically spread from one kind of animal to humans, that doesn’t ensure it will be able to spread between people (the vast majority of the time, it doesn’t). Perhaps significantly, the researchers identified other aspects of the newly found virus that likely hinders it from infecting people easily—a key point they highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Due to these suboptimal factors for human adaptation, the risk of BtHKU5-CoV-2 emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What this research does show, however, is that our fight against emerging infectious diseases exists in perpetuity. HKU5-CoV-2 might never jump over into humans, but others like it eventually could. Whether it’s a coronavirus, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/bird-flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, or some other unknown germ, the stage for the next pandemic will be set. So tracking and learning more about these threats as early as possible will be essential to stopping or at least blunting the harm they can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

People drink tea in the morning with breakfast, in between meals for an afternoon caffeine hit and to relax before bed. Most research on tea has focused on the effects of caffeine, tea’s nutritional value or how it &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/coffee-vs-tea-nutrition-health/?itid=sr_1_e875d336-6a66-4f11-8473-6fe1ff2c50ef" target="_blank"&gt;compares with coffee&lt;/a&gt;, but now scientists say that the stimulating beverage may provide a surprising health benefit: Your morning cup of tea could be removing dangerous contaminants from your water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QRHSS6UTFZAKPHP7G3ZRQ7CK4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A new study published in ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;found that tea leaves naturally adsorb heavy metals, filtering out harmful water contaminants like lead, cadmium or arsenic. The metals become trapped on the surface of the tea leaves and can be removed by simply filtering out the leaves or tossing the tea bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OBSTWX4YCBBKDH7RWTN2ZKRENQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’re taking the metals out of the water with the tea, but you don’t consume the tea leaves after, which is why it works,” said Benjamin Shindel, the study’s lead author, who at the time of the research was a PhD student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. As tea leaves release flavorful chemicals in the water, creating a tasty drink, they are just as effective at grabbing metals out of the water, Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WZMELII7YRFTFJ53MYAGRU327I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shindel’s study adds to a small body of research showing that tea adsorbs metals. A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024155508" target="_blank"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt; also found that tea leaves removed heavy metals from water. Saddam Husain Dhobi, the lead author of that study, said this research highlights the value of tea and “its potential as a safe and effective method for mitigating harmful substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HAZSUMFJO5ANBIS3DRGIPL5TJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new study, researchers experimented with a variety of teas, brewing methods and steeping times, and they examined the difference between loose-leaf and bagged tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INIRUJHXB5E2DGIFZKUC33VSJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the recipe for the purest cup of tea depends on one major factor: time. The longer the steep time, the more metal that’s removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZLSQKV4EFDNJNG7IBDIHBNRMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, researchers found that when steeping an average cup of tea for five minutes, there was a 15 percent reduction in lead concentrations — and that trend was consistent across cups, whether the concentrations of lead were higher or lower. Brewing tea overnight, a common method for brewing iced tea, provides better water purification than steeping for a few minutes. But even a few minutes can result in a moderate removal of metals, Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TIFZESZYLVE6FLKELUWZBE5G3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers also examined different varieties of tea to determine whether they provided any extra benefits. Black and green bagged tea were tested, as were whole tea leaves, including green, oolong, white and black teas. Herbal teas were also tested for their ability to get metals to stick to the surface of the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFPZZVJSQBC2VFMNMN7ZZWUSVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most teas, including herbal teas, performed similarly — apart from chamomile flowers, which adsorbed metals poorly. The study found that ground tea leaves perform best, compared with whole leaves, because grinding the leaves creates additional surface area for attracting the contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5OKNKSFYZJAVTAP2IS3YB6SMGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The type of tea bag mattered too. Cellulose tea bags, a biodegradable and organic material derived from trees, were highly effective at sponging metals from water.

            An unknown illness first discovered in three children who ate a bat has rapidly killed more than 50 people in northwestern Congo over the past five weeks, health experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu000x3b6mwdt2a4ty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The interval between the onset of symptoms – which include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding – and death has been 48 hours in most cases and “that’s what’s really worrying,” said Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu000y3b6mdc5au2cw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These “hemorrhagic fever” symptoms are commonly linked to known deadly viruses, such as Ebola, dengue, Marburg and yellow fever, but researchers have ruled these out based on tests of more than a dozen samples collected so far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu000z3b6me75w4htm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, with 419 cases recorded and 53 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu00103b6mbwfdeb6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There have long been concerns about &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-united-nations-animals-world-organization-7d104d2f4a87dd29ddb5d263986f731c" target="_blank"&gt;diseases jumping from animals to humans&lt;/a&gt; in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu00123b6mal3agpbf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the second outbreak of the mystery disease began in the village of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases were sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples were negative for common hemorrhagic fever diseases, although some tested positive for malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu00133b6mts8pzcvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

Yet, more and more, the science is pointing to the health risks of drinking alcohol. In January, the U.S. Surgeon General issued an urgent health advisory, ranking alcohol as the third leading cause of cancer, right after tobacco and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This news mirrors what happened back in 1994 when the U.S. Surgeon General at that time sparked a pivotal change in how we perceive health and social norms when he boldly stated that tobacco is linked to cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For decades, cigarette smoking was socially acceptable, with little awareness of the damage it was doing,” says&lt;a href="https://drchristinemaren.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Christine Maren, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified physician specializing in functional medicine. Fast-forward to today, and we are facing a similar wake-up call—this time with alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new health advisory challenges the way we’ve long viewed alcohol consumption—as a harmless enjoyment, particularly in moderation. But with new data shedding light on the risks, it begs the question: Is it time to take a closer look at our relationship with alcohol? With insights from a range of health experts, we dive into this very question and offer practical tips for those looking to dial back their drinks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For much of history, alcohol has walked a thin line between remedy and risk—once celebrated as medicine, now known to carry hidden dangers. “The first alcoholic beverages emerged in China around 7000-5600 B.C., but it wasn't until the 16th century that alcohol became deeply embedded in daily life,” says &lt;a href="https://amandaewhite.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda E. White, LPC, LMHC&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed therapist, who herself recovered from alcohol misuse and now helps others do the same.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ancient Egyptians were toasting with beer, Greeks sipped wine at philosophical debates, medieval monks brewed beer as a spiritual practice, and alcohol was once used as a safe alternative to questionable water sources,” says &lt;a href="https://theoncologydietitian.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nichole Andrews, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an oncology registered dietitian nutritionist.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Jump ahead a few hundred years, and we’ve seen it all—from the hush-hush speakeasies of Prohibition to the glittering cocktail culture immortalized by Hollywood, Andrews shares.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For decades, alcohol was sold as a social aid, a stress reliever and even a heart-health enhancer, often praised in the Mediterranean diet for its supposed benefits when enjoyed as a daily glass of wine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But lately, science has shaken up this narrative. “Today, the conversation is shifting, thanks to mounting evidence showing alcohol’s direct link to cancer, liver disease and even mental health problems. While alcohol may have a deep cultural legacy, it doesn’t get a free pass when it comes to our health,” Andrew asserts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-the-latest-science-says"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What the Latest Science Says &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cancer Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alcohol is a known carcinogen that increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, liver, mouth, esophagus, voice box and throat cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Surgeon General’s January 2025 advisory tells it to us straight: Alcohol now ranks as the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, responsible for around 100,000 cases and 20,000 deaths each year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though it may be tempting to toss this risk aside, the reality is that alcohol’s connection to cancer isn’t just about the statistics—it’s rooted in biology. “When alcohol is metabolized, it produces acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct that damages DNA and prevents cells from repairing themselves, creating the perfect storm for cancer development,” says&lt;a href="https://thyroidcancerdietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Julia Diaz, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a thyroid cancer dietitian nutritionist.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It doesn’t stop there: Diaz warns that alcohol also throws your hormones out of balance, spiking estrogen levels and upping breast cancer risks. On top of that, it drains your body of vital nutrients needed to fight off damage, leaving you even more vulnerable to cancer development.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these effects only kick in when you down too many drinks, right? Guess again. Studies undeniably show that even one drink a day increases your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although drinking in moderation is often encouraged, the evidence tells a different story: there’s no safe level of alcohol consumption when it comes to cancer risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Heart Disease Risk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking in moderation poured into popularity with the belief that sipping on wine could benefit your heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For years, we were told that a glass of red wine a day keeps the cardiologist away—but science is making it clear: that’s a myth, not a health strategy,” says Andrews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what’s the real deal? “The idea that moderate alcohol is ‘heart-healthy’ came from flawed studies full of confounding variables (aka, sneaky factors that distorted the data),” she explains. “Many moderate drinkers in these studies also had healthier lifestyles overall—they exercised, ate nutritious foods and had better access to health care. Meanwhile, heavier drinkers often had additional health risks, making alcohol look better than it actually is.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The truth? Alcohol, even in small amounts, can elevate blood pressure and weaken the heart muscle, leading to increased risk of heart disease, stroke and heart failure over time, says &lt;a href="https://upliftfitnutrition.com/about-lacey-dunn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lacey Dunn, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you’ve been winding down with a glass of wine in hopes of protecting your heart, the latest research suggests it may be doing more harm than good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Anxiety, Depression and Cognitive Decline Risks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking may seem like a way to calm life’s storms, but it often adds more weight to the burdens we’re trying to lighten. “People often drink to cope with anxiety or depression, but alcohol actually disrupts our brain chemistry, making these conditions worse long-term,” says White.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Recent studies have identified specific mechanisms by which alcohol alters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate systems, explaining why anxiety often worsens after drinking,” says White.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She notes that alcohol is a depressant, and our body produces cortisol and adrenaline to counteract its effects. This means that as you sip to find relief from anxiety, you are actually reinforcing a loop that keeps you tethered to the emotions you’re trying to outrun. As a result, you end up feeling more anxious the next day. White shares that drinking to cope with negative emotions is one of the strongest predictors of developing alcohol use disorder.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The irony? Every glass chips away at your brain’s natural ability to manage those feelings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But it’s not just about how you feel. It’s also about how alcohol impacts your memory. “New research indicates alcohol specifically targets the hippocampus, affecting both short-term memory formation and the consolidation of memories during sleep,” says White.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This not only impacts daily cognitive function but may also contribute to poor decision-making around drinking itself, creating a challenging cycle to break.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Liver Damage &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The liver, in particular, bears much of the brunt, as it’s responsible for breaking down alcohol and removing toxins from the body. Over time, alcohol can pile on the pressure, causing the liver to become overloaded and inflamed. Andrews expresses that this sets the stage for fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis and, in the worst-case scenario, cirrhosis—where the liver is scarred beyond repair and its ability to function goes downhill.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Andrews points out that alcohol takes a toll on the immune system, leaving the body more susceptible to infections and slower healing. “Chronic drinking lowers the production of white blood cells, your body’s natural defense system, increasing the risk of illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis and even COVID-19 complications,” she emphasizes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think that nightcap is helping you sleep? It’s actually doing the opposite. “While alcohol can make you drowsy, it fragments sleep cycles and suppresses REM sleep, the deep stage crucial for memory, learning and cognitive function,” says Andrews.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She explains that alcohol reduces sleep quality by increasing nighttime awakenings and decreasing restorative sleep. White shares that newer research shows it also disrupts our slow-wave sleep, which is crucial for physical restoration and memory consolidation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now that you know the science, it’s hard to ignore that the pull to drink still lingers, even with the logical awareness of the consequences. After all, alcohol is deeply woven into our social celebrations, cultural traditions and even daily routines. But perhaps, for a moment, you may pause to reflect on your habits—how the last drink made you feel and how it might impact your health in the future. If you are considering cutting back, here are some simple, actionable steps you can take to limit or completely avoid alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Taking a Break from Booze &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As more people embrace initiatives like Dry January and Sober October, taking a break from alcohol has now become more socially acceptable than ever before. As a licensed therapist, White recommends starting with a 30- to 90-day break to get a clear picture of your relationship with alcohol. “This period allows you to identify triggers and develop new coping mechanisms,” she explains. She outlines that it’s about digging into whether those triggers are emotional, tied to your environment, linked to certain exposures or even connected to certain times of the day or year. If it would be helpful, consider reaching out to a professional or someone close to you to guide and hold you accountable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rethinking Moderation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to drinking alcohol, health institutions recommend moderation. As a reference, the National Institutes of Health defines moderate drinking as up to one drink a day for women and up to two for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But, as we’ve seen, even moderate drinking is risky business. Even if you only drink on special occasions or weekend outings, you may find it helpful to explore life without alcohol entirely. In doing so, you may discover how much healthier you feel, how your relationships strengthen and the unexpected ways your overall quality of life improves. But, whether you set weekly limits or put down the glass completely, it’s about finding what aligns with your personal goals and health needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Considering Your Social Scenarios &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking culture is deeply ingrained in many social settings—parties, family gatherings, dating and even casual get-togethers—but we have the power to rewrite the script,” says Andrews. The good news is that, nowadays, it’s pretty easy to find nonalcoholic options in bars and restaurants. However, if you know you’re heading to a place where options might be limited, Diaz recommends bringing your own nonalcoholic drink to share. Participating in activities that don’t revolve around drinking, like hiking, yoga or game nights, is also a great way to have fun alcohol-free. But what do you do when your friends start pouring the pressure as freely as the drinks? Diaz highlights the importance of filling your social circle with people who respect your decisions and align with your goals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finding new ways to celebrate and unwind without alcohol can help build lasting change. Maren shares that one of her top tips is to create a new “anchor”—a special drink that feels celebratory but isn’t alcohol. “In psychology, anchors are the things we associate with a habit, and for many people, drinking is as much about the ritual as it is about the alcohol itself. Rather than feeling like you’re giving something up, replace it with a new ritual,” she wisely advises. From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7923275/best-nonalcoholic-wines-according-to-a-sommelier/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol-free wines&lt;/a&gt;, beers and spirits to a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7883572/elderberry-elixir-mocktail/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fancy mocktail&lt;/a&gt;, you can still enjoy the flavors of alcoholic beverages without the actual booze. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With the U.S. Surgeon General’s warning about the impact of alcohol and cancer risk, it’s crucial to take a closer look at how alcohol affects our overall health. From its impact on heart health and mental well-being to liver function, immune support and sleep quality, understanding these risks empowers us to make more informed, mindful choices about alcohol consumption. Whether you choose to cut back completely, consume on occasion or take periodic breaks throughout the year, having this knowledge allows you to make choices that align with your health goals. The conversation about alcohol is evolving, and now’s the time to truly ask ourselves what role it plays in our lives and whether it’s time for a change.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — An unknown illness first discovered in three children who ate a bat has rapidly killed more than 50 people in northwestern Congo over the past five weeks, health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interval between the onset of symptoms – which include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding – and death has been 48 hours in most cases and “that’s what’s really worrying,” said Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These “hemorrhagic fever” symptoms are commonly linked to known deadly viruses, such as Ebola, dengue, Marburg and yellow fever, but researchers have ruled these out based on tests of more than a dozen samples collected so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, with 419 cases recorded and 53 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the second outbreak of the mystery disease began in the village of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases were sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples were negative for common hemorrhagic fever diseases, although some tested positive for malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, another mystery flu-like illness that killed dozens of people in another part of Congo was determined likely to be malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

The US in 2023 halted funding for the lab, which had received money through the US-based EcoHealth Alliance, amid the controversy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This newly discovered bat virus infects cells by binding to a protein found throughout the bodies of humans and other mammals. It’s closely related to the coronavirus family that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That virus, also known as MERS, has been confirmed in around 2,600 people globally from 2012 through May 2024, killing roughly 36 percent of those infected. The vast majority of the cases were in Saudi Arabia, according to the World Health Organization website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;A person is contagious about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Common symptoms for measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The "measles rash" typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent getting measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with two doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus. Review your and your child’s vaccination history to see if you are up-to-date on your measles vaccines. Additionally, discuss with your provider your vaccination history and any questions about these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling outbreaks in group settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;People with confirmed or suspected measles should stay home from school, work, and other group settings until after the fourth day of rash onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;During an outbreak, people without documented immunity from vaccination or previous measles infection should be isolated from anyone with measles to protect those without immunity and control the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;According to the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7, schools and childcare settings shall exclude unimmunized children for at least 21 days after the last date the unimmunized child was exposed to a measles case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this article comes from the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 18:12:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOMEczWmZmdkt3RkcxUV9uVWlrZGl1VS1xWjIwa2M0NU8tbldIeFhqVHBrWDdkRVQzOVg2MzRfamVSa3lPalBYM3hrZVZ1SkYycDQ5TTRVV3p1VU1EZ1hNU25NbVpuT3lmcC0wbExEUWdHcTVPZ0dhVmNJck1sY0EwNFdMWG_SAYoBQVVfeXFMTlh3OURHLUs5aWVtWFhkOXZEbVE1eVNMRzBuakRfal9UUjR1RU15OUl0dHQ1TWtFNEw3b2xLTzNXRlc1MnRKSERTT0JZQ3ZtWHpOeTFMaFozZU9lTkw4SUs0X1lvMHRCMVpGQWpXenhvcXBUSnNoRnFkSmFSN19YZnE0RnFwSWV5c0ZR</guid></item><item><title>A Kidney Transplant Came With an Unwelcome Hitchhiker: A Deadly Tick Germ - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSWtjRGVEWkVra3NTbjZmUy1uVU91MzhoZGNwM0hDTTd4UFN4QVFiUlJGaUZtNTNoMmlnZkVlQ1BhNk9DelZoQkNGS2V6M1RORi1QbDJEY2dfTnNFU1FsU09RTWVTSmtLNG1IRXhDZXk0WEhtYXFOVmlIT1hSTzhqTzlUcHliTkFURTJ4eFhwczA5OUk5dEd1eEN4cHdhZ09WdzJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A person’s precious organ donation came with an unexpected visitor. In a new paper out this month, scientists have documented an unconventional way of catching a rare germ normally spread by ticks: from a person’s infected donated kidney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors and health officials detailed the unusual mishap in a report &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1723_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. Both the living donor and recipient became sick soon after their operations, leading doctors to discover that the former had transmitted an infection caused by &lt;em&gt;Ehrlichia &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. Fortunately, the tainted transfer was detected in time and both patients were treated successfully.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ticks are prolific carriers of many germs, including the germs behind Lyme disease, relapsing fever, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/about/index.html"&gt;ehrlichiosis&lt;/a&gt;. Several species of bacteria cause ehrlichiosis, though most cases are tied to &lt;em&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt;. The disease is rarely documented, though cases have been increasing over time. In 2022, there were 1,570 reported cases of ehrlichiosis compared to 201 cases in 2000, when the disease first became nationally tracked. But this most recent case is even rarer than usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report authors, the donor was a 33-year-old man from Minnesota who agreed to donate his kidney to an unrelated recipient. He had no obvious red flags, passing all the typical screening tests, which include looking for infections that could be dangerous if passed onto a transplant recipient. His recipient was a 24-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease from Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Both men’s operations went smoothly. But on the same day after his kidney was removed, the donor developed a rash on his left hip and leg along with muscle pain and weakness. Doctors diagnosed him with rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle tissue rapidly breaks down and releases proteins that damage organs, particularly the kidney. Doctors stabilized him quickly, and he recovered well enough to be discharged six days after the operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recipient, meanwhile, appeared fine at first. But a week after the transplant, he was admitted to the hospital with fever, joint pain, and fluid build-up around his kidneys. Given the man’s other symptoms, including a low platelet count, the doctors tested him for various tickborne germs, which eventually confirmed the presence of &lt;em&gt;E. chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt; bacteria. He was given a new course of antibiotics standard for these infections and eventually recovered as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All ehrlichiosis cases in the U.S. must be reported to state health agencies. The recipient’s organ transplantation, coupled with the fact that he had no other risk factor for ehrlichiosis (such as traveling recently to tick-laden parts of the U.S.), prompted a wider investigation by health officials in both Wisconsin and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, they discovered that the donor had traveled to Kansas for a hunting trip a month before his operation, and that he had to remove several ticks from his clothing and body while there. He also felt sick a week before the transplant, though he attributed it to simple food poisoning. Other tests found evidence of the bacteria in the donor and in the transplanted kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The laboratory evidence, exposure history, and epidemiology of ehrlichiosis strongly support donor-derived transmission of &lt;em&gt;E. chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt; initially acquired by the donor through a tick bite in Kansas 3 weeks before donation,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transplanted cases of ehrlichiosis are exceedingly rare, but not unheard of—and they can be deadly. A 2021 paper, for instance, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8906657/"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; two deaths likely caused by ehrlichiosis caught from a single deceased donor’s kidneys in 2020. The typical fatality rate is around 1%, though roughly 60% of patients still get hospitalized as a result. But ehrlichiosis and other infections are generally more dangerous for transplant recipients, since they have to take immune-suppressing drugs to avoid organ rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Given how rare this disease is, the doctors say it wouldn’t be justified to routinely screen for it in donors. But transplant doctors should keep an eye out for the potential risk posed by ehrlichiosis and other germs normally spread by ticks. “In summary, clinicians should remain vigilant for tickborne infections in potential organ donors, particularly those with known exposure to common disease vectors,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Spoiler: These tiny seeds are absolutely packed with nutrients, making them a powerhouse ingredient you can add to a range of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike some buzzy nutritional foods, chia seeds have some solid scientific research to back up their health halo. In fact, a recent study found that these seeds can do your health a solid on a range of fronts, including lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol, and even helping you to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal with chia seeds, plus why nutrition experts are all about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;; Christy Brissette, RD, nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39299649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostaglandins &amp;amp; Other Lipid Mediators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prostaglandins &amp;amp; Other Lipid Mediators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last September, analyzed data from 14 clinical trials that involved 835 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study found that adding chia seeds to your diet could help lower your cholesterol and your risk of cardiovascular disease, control blood pressure, and help manage weight. Specifically, researchers noted a drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol and blood pressure and a “notable” drop in the levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood that’s linked to heart disease, in individuals who consumed higher amounts of chia seeds. This was actually apparent in people who ate both higher amounts—more than 35 grams—and lower amounts—less than 35 grams—of chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the health benefits of chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have a lot of good things going for them. Fun fact: The Aztecs dubbed them ‘running food’ because they were used as a vital energy source during long expeditions when food supplies were scarce, says Christy Brissette, RD, nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, these tiny seeds are a good source of soluble and insoluble fiber, both of which are good for your digestive health, Brissette says. "Not only does it help you stay regular [with bowel movements], the fiber in chia seeds can help you feel more full and support weight management,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fiber can also prevent post-meal blood sugar spikes and helps trap cholesterol to remove it from your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are also nutrient-dense, serving up plenty of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, and iron, points out Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. “The omega-3s they contain contribute to anti-inflammatory benefits and may support heart health by improving lipid profiles,” he says. “Additionally, their antioxidant content helps combat oxidative stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9834868/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific analysis &lt;/a&gt;even found that the antioxidants and polyphenols in chia seeds may help to lower the risk of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do chia seeds impact the body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can do a few things for you. “Chia seeds absorb water and form a gel, which slows digestion and can promote fullness, potentially aiding weight management,” Keatley says. (Because they absorb liquid, just be aware that eating them dry in large amounts could cause digestive issues, like bloating and gas.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s hard to say that adding any one food to your diet will cause a big change in your health. But chia seeds have the potential to add these perks to your life when they’re coupled with other healthy lifestyle habits, according to &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote better digestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help with weight management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower bodily inflammation to help protect against chronic disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help with diabetes blood sugar management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much should I be consuming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a universally recommended dose for chia seeds. Nutrition experts generally recommend aiming for a tablespoon a day. If you end up having more than that, great. If you're consuming less, don't worry. You’re still getting plenty of nutrients and reaping the health benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just remember: “To prevent digestive discomfort, it's important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water,” Dr. Kim says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best ways to eat chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are surprisingly versatile, Brissette says. She recommends sprinkling them on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a45645043/passion-dragon-fruit-chia-pudding-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a40592712/baked-pumpkin-oatmeal-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a24733894/are-acai-bowls-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acai bowls;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acai bowls&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re also great on top of salads or on avocado toast, or as chia pudding,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim also suggests adding whole or ground chia seeds to smoothies, juices, pancake batter, and baked goods like muffins and bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brissette even uses chia seeds to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63904726/best-high-protein-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:replace eggs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;replace eggs&lt;/a&gt; in baking. “Just mix one tablespoon of chia seeds with three tablespoons of water,” she says. “Let it sit for five minutes and it will form a gel and then add to your wet ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any risks or side effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can cause bloating or gas if you’re not used to a high-fiber diet, Keatley says. So, start slow before ramping up consumption. And since chia seeds absorb liquid and expand, eating them dry could even pose a choking hazard, Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seed allergies do exist, so if you have one, stay away from this health food. (If you’re unsure, Dr. Kim says that chia seed allergies tend to overlap with sesame seed allergies.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim also recommends being aware that chia seeds may alter the effect of some medications, including drugs used for diabetes and blood pressure, along with blood thinners. They may also interact with some supplements you’re taking. The fiber and phytic acid in chia seeds “may reduce zinc, calcium, and iron absorption,” Dr. Kim says. Basically, if you’re on one of these medications or take a supplement, it’s a good idea to check in with your doctor before adding a steady stream of chia seeds to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have chia seeds in your diet right now, nutritionists recommend giving them a try. “I'm a chia seed superfan,” Brissette says. “They’re nutritional rock stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:07:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBtR01GQzFOcG55VzdTTkJscnVtOHl6M3h0ZHZ2YnFJOHJrbl9zNElfanJHYU44enBUai1VX0dGbUJ6VW9nbEpNdVI1bWNBY1RtMjFBSnpNS1pRV3BGWWlhZjA4eUJpVEhXXzNTS2NDQlI2MW03cW4xTw</guid></item><item><title>Brewing tea removes lead from water - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdjd4amJQeTM2VjF0bUIyVzhWVElrUExNNDlPcFExTVg4RUlNTml5V212aVFlRXQ0cl9JTzdkc0hmUTZnV1MyU2NVTmQxTXVqOXhtX216bXMwMFdPalVmdzFJeFJWQzM0MHhSNDEtSEEtajg0U0h5bl9YSWpXdW5zQUlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the authors purchased Lipton and Infusions commercial tea bags, as well as a variety of loose-leaf teas and herbal alternatives: black tea, green tea, white peony tea, oolong tea, rooibos tea, and chamomile tea. The tea bags were of different types (cotton, cellulose, and nylon). They brewed the tea the same way daily tea drinkers do, steeping the tea for various time intervals (mere seconds to 24 hours) in water spiked with elevated known levels of lead, chromium, copper zinc, and cadmium. Tea leaves were removed after steeping by pouring the tea through a cellulose filter into a separate tube. The team then measured how much of the toxic metals remained in the water and how much the leaves had adsorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the type of tea bag matters. The team found that cellulose tea bags work the best at adsorbing toxic metals from the water while cotton and nylon tea bags barely adsorbed any contaminants at all—and nylon bags also release contaminating microplastics to boot. Tea type and the grind level also played a part in adsorbing toxic metals, with finely ground black tea leaves performing the best on that score. This is because when those leaves are processed, they get wrinkled, which opens the pores, thereby adding more surface area. Grinding the tea further increases that surface area, with even more capacity for binding toxic metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most significant factor was steeping time: the longer the steeping time, the more toxic metals were adsorbed. Based on their experiments, the authors estimate that brewing tea—using a tea bag that steeps for three to five minutes in a mug—can remove about 15 percent of lead from drinking water, even water with concentrations as high as 10 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the saying that the &lt;strong&gt;eyes are the windows to the soul&lt;/strong&gt;, but new research shows they are also connected to how we breathe. Scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands have confirmed that&lt;strong&gt; pupil size&lt;/strong&gt; fluctuates in sync with breathing, revealing a deeper link between our vision and bodily rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Well-known Triggers Of Pupil Changes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have studied pupil size to understand attention, emotion, and medical conditions. Three key factors were known to influence how pupils react: light exposure, cognitive effort and focus and emotional arousal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;German researcher &lt;strong&gt;Irene Loewenfeld&lt;/strong&gt; once stated: “Man may either blush or turn pale when emotionally agitated, but his pupils always dilate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These pupil responses are so consistent and reliable that they are often used in psychology, neuroscience, and medical diagnoses. If a pupil fails to react to light, for example, it can signal a neurological emergency &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/10/consumed-by-many-this-oil-could-increase-the-risk-of-stroke/"&gt;such as a stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Newly Discovered “Pupillary Respiratory Phase Response”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have confirmed a fourth factor influencing pupil size: breathing. In a newly identified phenomenon called pupillary respiratory phase response, pupils tend to be largest during exhalation and smallest at the start of inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimizing for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” said Martin Schaefer, postdoctoral researcher,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This effect is entirely internal, originating within the body rather than as a reaction to external stimuli. The &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381860248_The_Respiratory-Pupillary_Phase_Effect_Pupil_size_is_smallest_around_inhalation_onset_and_largest_during_exhalation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research team&lt;/a&gt; reviewed past studies and found anecdotal hints of this connection &lt;strong&gt;dating back over 50 years&lt;/strong&gt;, but prior evidence remained inconclusive at best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to modify their breathing patterns, switching between nose and mouth breathing and adjusting their breathing rate. “Pupil size remained smallest around the onset of inhalation and largest during exhalation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Tool For Diagnosing Brain Disorders?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In medicine, pupil reactions are already used to assess brain function. For instance, if pupils fail to respond to light, it could signal a neurological emergency such as a stroke or brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;With this new discovery, researchers suggest that irregularities in the connection between breathing and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/ai-can-spot-your-stroke-risk-through-a-simple-eye-test/"&gt;pupil&lt;/a&gt; size might serve as an early indicator of neurological disorders. Conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/uncovering-alzheimers-could-herpes-be-a-key-player/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, or even anxiety disorders could potentially disrupt this newly identified breathing-pupil link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where Do We Go From Here?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that researchers have confirmed the link between breathing and pupil size, the next step is to explore its broader significance. Future studies may investigate whether manipulating breathing patterns can enhance focus or visual clarity, potentially offering new techniques for improving cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, they may examine whether other internal rhythms, such as heartbeat or blood flow, influence pupil behavior, further uncovering how the body and brain work in sync. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This discovery suggests that, in ways we are only beginning to understand, our bodies actively shape our experience of reality—one breath at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

Think about not having someone sit in the waiting room for a long period," Dr. White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here are the symptoms to look out for: High fever, ear infections, runny nose, pink eye, and a rash that can go from head to toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you get any of these, you need to call your doctor in advance and let them know you possibly have measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you got your series of vaccines years ago, Dr. White also mentioned that you can get a blood test with your doctor to see if you still have immunity from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;For news updates, follow Mayra Moreno on &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC13MayraMoreno/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://twitter.com/MayraABC13" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.instagram.com/tvmayramoreno/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="uvrxY zOGtW "&gt;Copyright © 2025 KTRK-TV.

Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet was associated with lower obesity-related cancer risk regardless of BMI (body mass index) or fat distribution,” said first author Inmaculada Aguilera-Buenosvinos, a postdoctoral scientist in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Navarra’s Institute for Health Research in Pamplona, Spain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This suggests that other mechanisms — such as reduced inflammation, improved metabolic health, or dietary interactions with the microbiome — may be responsible for the protective effects,” said Aguilera-Buenosvinos, also a postdoctoral scientist at the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based diets boost the health of the planet as well as the health of people, experts say. - monticelllo/iStockphoto/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;A plant-based diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/eat-but-better?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; features simple, plant-based cooking, with much of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/19/health/olive-oil-healthiest-quality-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:extra-virgin olive oil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;extra-virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt;. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Plant-based meal plans like those in the Mediterranean diet are full of fiber, said Lindsey Wohlford, a wellness dietitian at the University of Texas’ MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Fiber contributes to fullness and supports a healthy microbiome,” Wohlford said. “Plants are also packed with antioxidants and phytonutrients, which appear to reduce inflammation in the body. We have to eat a variety of plants to get the different nutrients and antioxidants that may help reduce overall cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the Mediterranean diet, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/03/health/red-meat-processed-meat-chicken-fish-health-risks-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:red meat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; is used sparingly, often only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The highly processed foods typical in a Western diet can contain chemicals and additives that cause “oxidative damage which can lead to cancer,” said Dr. Neil Iyengar, associate professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and breast cancer oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, both in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What we put into our bodies every day can impact nearly every function of our body through hormones, fat and muscle tissue, and the delicate balance of bacteria in our gut,” said Iyengar, who was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Consuming a minimally processed, plant forward diet can help to reduce or even reverse the oxidative damage that a poor diet can cause to our body,” he said in an email. “We are also starting to see some limited evidence that this type of diet — minimally processed, high fiber, and plant-forward — may even help some cancer therapies to be more effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Each dietary change helps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study, published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.61031&amp;amp;utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2024.61031" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Network Open;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed diet and medical data on more than 450,000 people taking part in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, or EPIC study, which enrolled participants between 35 and 70 years from 1992 to 2000 across 23 centers in 10 countries. Three of those countries — Greece, Italy and Spain — are known for their use of the Mediterranean diet; the other seven countries are not (Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who most closely adhered to the Mediterranean diet had about a 6% lower risk of developing obesity-related cancers compared to those with less adherence, the study found. While that number may appear small, the significance grows when applied to larger populations, Aguilera-Buenosvinos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even a small reduction in risk at the individual level can translate into thousands of preventable cancer cases when applied at the population level,” she said. “Promoting adherence to the Mediterranean Diet as a low-cost, accessible, and sustainable dietary pattern could have a major impact on cancer prevention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having occasional breaks from the diet also helped keep cancer at bay, although not as much as fully embracing the Mediterranean style of eating, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In other words, it’s ok to have a ‘cheat’ meal here and there,” Iyengar said. “The diet had an even higher protective effect for smokers, which is likely because smokers are starting at a higher risk compared to non-smokers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oddly, the study did not find the Mediterranean diet lowered the risk of hormone cancers, such as breast cancers, a finding that contradicts prior research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Tips for getting started on the Mediterranean diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Americans are used to eating ultraprocessed foods, which populate &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1704" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:up to 70% of all grocery store shelves;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;up to 70% of all grocery store shelves&lt;/a&gt;, so moving to a plant-based diet can appear difficult at first,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It can be very overwhelming if you’re not used to eating the Mediterranean diet or plants in general,” Wohlford said. “Set small goals. A good first step is look at what your diet might be missing rather than focusing on removing forbidden foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Add blueberries to your morning meal, munch on a handful of nuts for a snack, and eating a salad with lunch are good ways to start, she said. Then try to fill more of your dinner plate with vegetables, whole grains and legumes, and consider a piece of fruit for dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We really want a consistent diet that can be sustained over time,” Wohlford said. “Trying a Mediterranean style diet for three or four months to meet certain metrics is not necessarily going to reduce your risk of cancer. You want to adopt this type of diet consistently throughout the course of the rest of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 16:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPandlcmxEeV9GSXJPN0RMQnQ1enI1dWc3cTNpVGItdklieFNURG01a3dpYmRpS2tuYjRmb1NWQjhlTUJWUm1MVGt3dGRhMnRxbE5jOV9wQndLbG5oZ0liNEhzR2R2cVVwUncyWWNrZENLWlN4b1QwRnA1TkpYVmlKeA</guid></item><item><title>‘Unknown disease’ that can kill within days leaves 53 dead in Congo - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxONlBGbEtjNjU5SlhoS3pVWDdXMnVHRWhpajhJbmZuc1lJNjlSTHJySDloTXRrQ2x0cFpRdEM3MTQ3aWotUkVRSjZNNFBOSDh2OXFZa2swUTEyN1d5OGw0S0R2RU96RGhpY2JyRlhTTEJ4MjQyTXBnMXU5blotUzkyNlF5QUlGMTlZY3llT3RZdkZLTkxKSFlyTlk0Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TNE5UZWXFFG4VAXJ5BQGCD7WAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An unknown illness has killed 53 people in a northwest region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a significant portion of deaths taking place within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, according to the World Health Organization, which describes the outbreak as posing “a significant public health threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AOKHCXU6ZNGYNCSERQHP37JBJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At least 431 cases have been reported since January of individuals suffering from fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue, &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380529/OEW7-1016022025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the WHO’s Africa office&lt;/a&gt;.

For one, their injury or condition is more likely to worsen, extending their recovery time and boosting the odds they develop complications from procedures, Patel says. Meanwhile, daily tasks like work, laundry, or tending to children become extremely difficult to impossible to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It doesn’t help that women “have more responsibilities that are non-negotiable,” Baxter says. For instance, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/283979/women-handle-main-household-tasks.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;a 2019 Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; found that women in heterosexual relationships were more likely to cook, clean, do laundry, wash dishes, grocery shop, and care for children on a daily basis. “If you’re a male in pain, it’s a lot easier in society to [relax]. But the female existence means there’s no way to opt out…and that could contribute to our pain perception.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“And so for women, being disabled is a bigger issue,” Baxter adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Over time, acute pain can morph into the chronic kind, Patel says. For some people, this might look like anxiety or depression; for others, it could be substance abuse in a last-ditch effort to self-medicate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 15:03:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5hMlVFYUFjLUxwN2NlQzZjZENZLWJyZGhTWTZyRGZrTWxfeGpva0FjbEJZcEhUNDJmZ3p3LUl3M005ZmhfZFJocXhZeDI4R3V2SjJDX3hBTExPNjJ1UXl5dDc0c1lTZnRyUElpVGJ2S05FaVRkdVZRWHUxYkE0QQ</guid></item><item><title>More than half of COVID-19 ECMO patients die in hospital, while survivors often struggle long term, study finds - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxOU1NnZlp5M2Z5QUpmNVBlVm9RVGE5ckdvSUc1djBZWWlma3BqU1RpVldEbldsVUJYMlRFWlo4OG54UHZCMW1vZ0pXWWhzdDFEbTFlRmdaM0llTndFczFZUVpSV09tUjgzclBOSFZFUFptUEh5aUg5MjBtOEFnbFJhZUZRaXA5WGRxWFNGaUlzcWpXZFJFVFJ2T2YtVlh5RFVsNjF1dng1Nlo4dTNtUHhFYTVhUlp1RkU4ZlRVbTdNMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, is one of the most serious life support measures offered at a hospital, with critically ill patients often receiving both heart and lung support for a number of days or weeks during organ and respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients sickened most severely with the virus were moved to ECMO after ventilation failed, with a 50% survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00369-2/abstract"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Respiratory Medicine&lt;/em&gt; tracks outcomes among ECMO patients from Sept 15, 2020, when the first wave of the pandemic ended, until the declared end of the pandemic on March 21, 2023, by the World Health Organization. The primary outcomes &lt;span&gt;of the study &lt;/span&gt;were in-hospital death and death 6 months after ECMO initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study looked at ECMO patients seen at 98 centers in 21 countries, all part of EuroECMO-COVID, a prospective observational study developed by the European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, time from hospital presentation to intensive care unit admission was 8 days, and the median time from intubation to ECMO start was 3 days. The chief indication for being placed on ECMO was acute respiratory distress syndrome—for 81.1% of the patients—and 53.4% required tracheostomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;56% in-hospital mortality rate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, there were 3,860 ECMO patients over the age of 16 years included in the study (69.7% men and 30.3% women; median age, 51 years). In-hospital mortality was 55.9% (2,158), with 81.2% of deaths occurring during ECMO support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both survivors and non-survivors, the median number of days on ECMO was 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who survived ECMO, almost all, 99.7%, were alive 6 months post-discharge. During the first wave of the pandemic, 95% of those who survived ECMO were still alive 6 months after their hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the study who died were more likely to suffer co-morbidities, including diabetes, high blood pressure, sepsis, and renal failure. They were also more likely to have a longer time between intubation and ECMO placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates that a high rate of complications is strongly associated with in-hospital mortality," the authors wrote. "Data from the second COVID-19 wave onwards confirmed the role of older age, co-morbidities, pre-ECMO indicators of hemodynamic instability (inotropes and vasopressors), longer intubation time before ECMO start, configuration change and complications in contributing to in-hospital mortality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Few survivors return to work by 6 months&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who survived, few had fully recovered at 6 months post-discharge. Only 11.4% of survivors resumed full-time work at that point, while 12.0% went back to part-time work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, a significant number of survivors had lasting symptoms at 6 months. Among survivors at that time point, 32.0% had difficulty breathing, 7.8% had cardiac symptoms, and 10.7% had neurocognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survival is a prolonged process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00416-8/abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the study, J. W. Awori Hayanga, MD, MPH, MHL, and Heather Kaiser Hayanga, MD, MPH, both of West Virginia University, said these lasting symptoms expand the clinical understating of post-ECMO life for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a growing need to address the post-decannulation existence of patients after recovering from severe life-threatening respiratory illness," they write. "Survival is a prolonged process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leaving WHO requires the approval of Congress and that the US meets its financial obligations for the current fiscal year.

Using a computer model of the basal ganglia and thalamus, researchers showed that holding too much information at once confuses the brain, impairing its ability to learn and use stored data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model demonstrated that the brain compensates for this limitation by strategically “chunking” related information together, improving efficiency. These findings also shed light on dopamine-related disorders like Parkinson’s and ADHD, suggesting new treatment approaches targeting the basal ganglia and thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Shapes Memory Limits:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain restricts working memory capacity to prevent overload and optimize learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chunking Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; To conserve space, the brain compresses related information, improving recall efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in dopamine delivery impair memory efficiency, linking working memory deficits to conditions like Parkinson’s and ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brown University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working memory is what allows humans to juggle different pieces of information in short-term scenarios, like making a mental grocery list and then going shopping or remembering and then dialing a phone number. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists agree that the capacity of working memory is limited, they offer competing theories about how and why this is true. But new research from scientists at the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown University shows why limits on working memory exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107949"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity.jpg" alt="This shows brain scans." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/learning-memory-capacity-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When she challenged the model to the same series of trials, the results showed that without a healthy dopamine delivery system, the model did not learn how to use its storage space as efficiently and did not chunk items as often. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Frank, a professor of cognitive and psychological sciences affiliated with the Carney Institute, and Aneri Soni, a graduate student in his lab, developed a new computer model of the basal ganglia and the thalamus — the parts of the brain relevant to working memory — that shows why limits on working memory exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to their study published in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, the answer has to do with learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The simulations we ran show that if we did hold more than just a few items at a time, it becomes too difficult to learn how to manage so many pieces of information at once, such that the brain gets confused and can’t use the information it does store,” Soni said. “At the same time, our research demonstrates that when faced with these limitations, the brain responds by learning to strategically tap into a mechanism to help conserve space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important role in how learning relates to working memory, the researchers said these findings shed new light on dopamine-related disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team arrived at their discovery by building and testing a new computer model of the brain that replicated the results of an experiment with humans conducted in 2018 by researchers in Frank’s lab and researchers in the lab of Matt Nassar, a Carney Institute assistant professor of neuroscience and cognitive and psychological sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study established that humans are capable of “chunking” information by compressing related pieces of information together in working memory to conserve space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soni knew she’d successfully built a brain-like computer model capable of compressing information when she challenged her model to a version of the 2018 experiment. She showed the model a screen with colored blocks oriented in different directions and then asked it to recall which colored block was pointing in which direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the course of a number of trials, the model learned how to strategically compress information and began chunking together similar colors, such as blue and light blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab’s simulations with the new model point to learning, rather than capacity, as the real driver of working memory, Soni said. She established this by running the trials on a model without the ability to chunk but with plenty of space to store items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She found that while the model with the chunking mechanism was able to strategically store information to its full storage capacity, the model without the chunking mechanism did not seem to realize it had access to such a large amount of storage and was worse at both storing and retrieving the items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component critical to the model’s learning process is a mechanism that emulates the human brain’s dopamine delivery system, Soni said. When the model was doing a better job of recalling the orientation of a larger number of blocks because it had chunked similar colors together to save space, the dopamine delivery system kicked in, telling the model to continue to use this strategy when faced with the same set of constraints in subsequent trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of the experiments, Soni altered the model’s dopamine delivery system to emulate what is known about dopamine levels in patients with Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and ADHD. When she challenged the model to the same series of trials, the results showed that without a healthy dopamine delivery system, the model did not learn how to use its storage space as efficiently and did not chunk items as often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New findings like this show how computational brain science can advance psychiatry, said Frank, who directs Carney’s Center for Computational Brain Science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take Parkinson’s disease as an example,” Frank said. “Most people think of it as a movement disorder because changes in movement are so obvious. But it turns out that Parkinson’s patients also have changes in working memory. They are generally treated with drugs that target the prefrontal cortex, but our findings suggest that we should be testing whether drugs that target the basal ganglia and thalamus help to improve symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank said that an increased understanding of what takes place within the basal ganglia and thalamus for people diagnosed with dopamine-related disorders may spur clinicians to adopt different treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the Department of Defense (ONR MURI Award N00014-23-1-2792) and the National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH084840-08A1, T32MH115895).

Traditional cognitive accounts focus either on limitations on the number or items that can be stored (slots models), or loss of precision with increasing load (resource models).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that a neural network model of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia can learn to reuse the same prefrontal populations to store multiple items, leading to resource-like constraints within a slot-like system, and inducing a trade-off between quantity and precision of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such “chunking” strategies are adapted as a function of reinforcement learning and WM task demands, mimicking human performance and normative models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, adaptive performance requires a dynamic range of dopaminergic signals to adjust striatal gating policies, providing a new interpretation of WM difficulties in patient populations such as Parkinson’s disease, ADHD and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These simulations also suggest a computational rather than anatomical limit to WM capacity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 14:23:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9jRGZIa2lKVEg2OVo5bzZ3YlF3cGJWOWdSMHc2NHhORl81QmJBVi03bEkxbGdvUlRKRkI4MnE2ZDFqbDJhVnd6ZnQydFBjVFVhMG0xZ1RMSm1RSnR4am9XQkx1RG1jendqcjJr</guid></item><item><title>Oregon’s flu season one of the worst in the past decade - Oregon Public Broadcasting</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxOQkFaa3UzYjVMaVhvVWwyNTMyTk1sOXhLQUt5WTRRa3pxWmpPU1dPS0s5aGRuc1pYLWdaWjh5NGRlY0ZrVnFJWWs2OS1HbDBueTJ0SUVMUzBuR01XQTlzZ2dIbHNDSmRWNk5ObFNqU3BJQVFOandYQmdlekdNQ0FwSUw2RENPVjVnd2RIVEFhQVdZMWFIbGgzdEpFc1dJYkNnVmxycjVxNFZPMzhKNGVydkR4R2RaVjdhUTFRY2FMTWc5UVJFWlFr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OC3IWFQ5UNHFTLXA7SJZKMIUNM.tif?auth=afe08a9fd775e1218858af311534112c4f6db025f9762ea669d9f7e1f36ccfcd&amp;amp;width=150" alt="Captured in 2013, this negative stained transmission electron microscopic image captured some of the ultrastructural details exhibited by the influenza A virus." class="width_full"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="background_lgray"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captured in 2013, this negative stained transmission electron microscopic image captured some of the ultrastructural details exhibited by the influenza A virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Cynthia S.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is classifying this flu season as&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html#:~:text=Nationally%2C%20seasonal%20influenza%20activity%20remains,severity%20season%20since%202017%2D2018." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; high severity overall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for all age groups for the first time since 2017-2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;That means flu is responsible for a higher-than-usual percentage of doctors visits, hospitalizations and deaths so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Flu can cause previously healthy people to become extraordinarily sick, according to Dr. Wendy Hasson, medical director of the pediatric ICU at Randall Children‚Äôs Hospital at Legacy Emanuel in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Hasson said that during her shifts this month, she‚Äôs treated several children who were critically ill due to the flu ‚Äúthat I have had to put on a ventilator, and on heart support, and sit bedside to manage them moment-to-moment.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In Oregon, the flu season started out normally. Transmission appeared to peak, as it often does, in late December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Public health officials use the percentage of flu tests ordered by hospitals and doctors that come back positive as an indicator of how widespread a virus is in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The week of Christmas 2024, 31.5% of Oregonians tested for the flu got a positive result back ‚Äî a high percentage indicating lots of community transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;By mid-January, that positivity rate had fallen to about 18%. Hospitalizations were falling too. It looked like the beginning of the end for the flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Then something unusual happened, said Dr. Paul Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases at the Oregon Health Authority. The test positivity rate for influenza started to climb again, along with hospitalizations. Last week, 21% of flu tests came back positive. The week before, the percentage was even higher. Both peaks have been due to Influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;State health officials don‚Äôt have the capacity to track flu hospitalizations statewide, so the Portland metro area serves as a proxy for how severe the season is. Since the start of flu season in October, OHA has reported 1,345 influenza hospitalizations in Clackamas, Multnomah and Washington counties. That number appears to be on par with what the state reported in the 2017-2018 season, a notably bad year for flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The hospitalization rate is the highest for people 65 years and older by far. That population accounts for about half of the patients hospitalized from the flu in the Portland metro area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúThis is not a quiet year for flu. I think it‚Äôs gonna be one of our worst,‚Äù Cieslak said. ‚ÄúI would definitely get vaccinated if you haven‚Äôt already.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray"&gt;The flu shot: not perfect, but effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The CDC recommends the flu shot annually for everyone 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/Q3GU6O5FDZBZZERI3BGJ3WHHLM.jpg?auth=528523ec536ba589e7d03d6aa0f35b36ebf15226011d55e87011f913ea86a7d8&amp;amp;width=150" alt="FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024." class="width_full"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="background_lgray"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Conlon / AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Despite that, less than half of Oregonians typically get their annual flu shot. And the percentage that does has been falling. Five years ago, 36.5% of Oregonians had their flu shot by late February. To date this flu season, &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/Oregon_Influenza_Vaccination/Statewide" target="_blank"&gt;29% of Oregonians have been vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;To Hasson, who treats people for flu complications in the ICU every year, the flu shot is the single vaccine she would recommend above all others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Yet the shot has a reputation for not working well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt our best vaccine,‚Äù when compared to shots like the measles vaccine, which prevent almost all cases of infection, Cieslak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúIn a typical year, flu vaccine is 40% to 50% effective against having to go to the doctor with the flu. It‚Äôs better, maybe 60%, in keeping you out of the hospital, but there are always some cases that manage to get through despite vaccination,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;What that means is that many people who get the flu shot will get the virus anyway, giving the shot bad word of mouth and contributing to people skipping it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The problem, according to Hasson, is that influenza is a more serious virus that many people realize. It can affect the entire body, attacking the heart, lungs, brain and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In cases in which people felt miserable and view the shot as not having worked, it may have provided some protection against even worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In 2019, with funding from the CDC, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/2/230/6506316" target="_blank"&gt;researchers looked more closely&lt;/a&gt; at the most serious outcomes of the flu in children: patients who were sick enough to need a ventilator and those who died from the virus. That study found that even in a year when the flu shot was not a great match for the strains of the virus that were circulating, it reduced the worst outcomes for kids by about 75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/2MAMT5TRJBA77ONL5R7AEB3I2I.jpg?auth=bb2d404460ffdb348ef1da857878d12da7fca6fb84c009bae76b92a443ef7ea8&amp;amp;width=150" alt="FILE - A patient is given a flu vaccine Oct. 28, 2022, in Lynwood, Calif.

In December, OHA reported two pediatric deaths due to flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Hasson said that pediatric deaths from flu are rare. But the influenza virus is much more likely than others that have been in the news ‚Äî RSV, COVID-19 or norovirus ‚Äî to cause extended hospitalizations for children. Some of those extended battles with the virus can cause long-term harm, leaving kids in need of ongoing oxygen support or unable to participate in sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;This year, the ICU at Randall Children‚Äôs Hospital has treated higher-than-usual numbers of children with complex cases of influenza, she said. Those include cases in which a child, weakened by the flu virus, develops a secondary bacterial infection or abscess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Hasson said the ‚Äúoverwhelming majority‚Äù of children who need prolonged ICU stays have not been vaccinated against the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Along with getting the vaccine, another step health officials recommend is proactively testing for the virus. For the first time this year, there‚Äôs an at-home test for the flu available over the counter at pharmacies: the single-swab tests for influenzas A and B and COVID-19. Antiviral treatments for flu work best if they are started one or two days after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray"&gt;Changes at the federal level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The severe flu season also comes in the midst of policy changes on the federal level that trouble Hasson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Last week, NPR and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAT reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a paid ad campaign for the flu vaccine, called Wild to Mild, shortly after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for HHS told NPR that officials inside the CDC were ‚Äúfalsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/N7OYNJQ26RDHZCJGQWPLE3CUTU.jpg?auth=3e97e854f5261c6039826f44d6fdc93d7d67ab47b11b668acce822a34d705966&amp;amp;width=150" alt="President Donald Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch swears in Robert F.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya has a warning for the world: "We are playing with fire."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kaseya&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He's talking about mpox, a virus that causes painful blisters and can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For much of the world, mpox — formerly known as monkeypox — seems like a virus from a few years ago. There was a global outbreak in 2022 and 2023 but the virus is no longer circulating as widely in Europe and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, large swathes of Africa are in the midst of a major outbreak. The epicenter is in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with more than 2,000 suspected cases reported each week for months, according to Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There seemed to be encouraging news at the end of January, when the number of new cases dropped suddenly. But mpox trackers are not celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decrease in terms of cases is not the reality," says Kaseya. Instead, he says, this is a sign that the ability to monitor and tally new cases has been interrupted. He attributes this to two things: "The combination between insecurity [and] lack of funding."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The insecurity he's referring to is in eastern DRC – a hotspot in the mpox outbreak – where rebel forces have taken control of key areas. The violence has interrupted mpox control and reporting work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lack of funding is the result of the abrupt &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;freeze in U.S. foreign aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instituted after President Trump took office on Jan. 20, along with the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/23/g-s1-50398/usaid-employees-leave" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fire or place on leave&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; most of the 10,000 people working for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Almost all of the agency's work has stalled, including critical parts of the mpox response effort. Trump also ordered the U.S. to leave the World Health Organization and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5276340/trump-centers-for-disease-control-cdc-world-health-organization" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stop communicating with WHO officials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who have played a critical role in mpox containment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like watching a train wreck in real time – and not being able to do a thing about it," says a health worker formerly part of the U.S. response team. The worker spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The outlook before Trump's inauguration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The global community rallied after both Africa CDC and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/08/14/g-s1-16977/mpox-public-health-emergency-world-health-organization-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a public health emergency in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over a billion dollars was pledged to the control effort by countries across Africa and Europe as well as Japan and the U.S., according to Africa CDC. President Biden promised $500 million as well as a million mpox vaccine doses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hope was to stop this outbreak of the virus and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the world. However, the DRC can be a challenging place to fight an infectious disease. It's an enormous country with poor road networks and a hot spot in the outbreak is in the war-torn east where overcrowded camps for displaced people are common. The mpox virus spreads through sexual contact as well as close contact, even via bed sheets.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. plays an outsized role in the public health of the DRC. Last year, the U.S. provided &lt;a href="https://fts.unocha.org/countries/52/summary/2024" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;almost 70%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of all humanitarian aid&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;going to the country, sending $965,000,000 to the DRC according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. And when it came to mpox response, the U.S. funds have supported a wide range of efforts from training lab technicians to providing diagnostic tests to supplying gloves and gowns for health workers to working with veterinarians for disease surveillance in animal populations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in late January, the campaign to quash the virus was interrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A turning point — for the worse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On January 27, M23 — a rebel group that the United Nations says is backed by Rwanda — swept into Goma, a city in the eastern DRC that has been a hub for disease response efforts. Intense fighting engulfed the city for several days and early U.N. estimates suggest a few thousand people were killed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"From one day to another, everything just collapsed," says Paulin Nkwosseu, chief of field operations for UNICEF in the DRC. UNICEF is the humanitarian agency funded and operated by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nkwosseu, who was traveling when the violence erupted, says the violence didn't just pause mpox response efforts. It likely made the outbreak significantly worse. That's because the vast majority of mpox patients in isolation wards fled to seek shelter from the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After the fighting erupted, we managed to locate only 15 [mpox patients]. So the rest are probably living within the community with a huge, huge risk of contamination," says Nkwosseu. "This is a very big risk in terms of public health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Africa CDC reports that at least 400 mpox patients fled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nkwosseu adds that the risk of spreading the virus is particularly big because the fighting meant many people lost access to clean water or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if aid workers could locate all the mpox patients who fled, Nkwosseu says, it's unclear where they would now go to be isolated and make sure they don't spread the disease to others. "Six of the seven mpox treatment centers have been looted and totally destroyed, including two supported by UNICEF," he says. "All the stocks of supplies, treatment, medicines, mattresses, tents — everything was looted."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program, says the violence has been a major setback. "All of the investment we've made over the last number of months to establish mpox surveillance, mpox control, mpox vaccinations – all of that is interrupted, on hold and impossible to continue," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Flying blind'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the same time as the security situation in eastern DRC deteriorated, President Trump froze almost all U.S. foreign assistance. While a judge has ruled that the funds should start flowing again and the administration has issued waivers for certain "lifesaving activities" — including the campaign against mpox — the aid world has faced major upheavals, with abrupt stop work orders and terminated contracts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts say there are at least two areas where the impacts of the aid freeze are already being felt on the mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, the vast majority of the mpox vaccines pledged by the U.S. are stuck in a warehouse. While the vaccines were donated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, USAID was facilitating the transfer to the DRC. And so the stop work orders halted the process, according to an individual who was working on the process and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In order for the vaccine donation to continue in the DRC, this individual says, HHS needs to release the vaccines – which involves the Trump administration affirming the donation – and USAID leadership needs to approve for funds to be dispersed to partners who would then help pay for the operational costs associated with the vaccine transfer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Second, the U.S. had been funding the secure transportation of suspected mpox samples from clinics to labs for testing — but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are scaling up the equipment for laboratory capacity, but the transportation of samples has become a nightmare," says&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-ngashi-ngongo/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Ngashi Ngongo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, head of Africa CDC's incident management support team based in DRC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ngongo says his team has documented a steep drop in the testing rate — the portion of suspected cases where there is testing to confirm the diagnosis — even in parts of the country where violence has not disrupted mpox response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The U.S., in particular, had been putting a lot of funding and effort into strengthening this surveillance. Without this piece, you're blind. You're flying blind in outbreak response," says an individual who had worked on the U.S. response and requested anonymity for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There has been a waiver granted by the U.S. government for mpox response to continue despite the freeze in foreign aid. NPR obtained an internal memo sent to USAID staff from Mark Lloyd, who was performing the duties of assistant administrator for the USAID Bureau for Global Health. On Feb. 13, he wrote that rapid emergency response is continuing for diseases like mpox. "This includes detection, prevention, and containment efforts ... such as the following activities: risk information for affected populations, active surveillance, infection prevention and control, support for testing, case management and treatment, and supply of medical countermeasures."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, restarting such activities has proved difficult. The payments have not resumed for mpox response, there are currently no American staff at the USAID mission in the capital of the DRC and Trump's order for the CDC officials not to communicate with WHO is still in place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined an interview request. The press line at USAID rang busy. NPR sent a request for comment to the State Department — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is acting administrator of USAID; the questions covered vaccine donations, transport of suspected mpox samples and the impact of disruptions in U.S. aid on the mpox outbreak. The request was not answered in time for our publication deadline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's not just mpox that is being impacted, public health experts warn, but a whole host of health threats that the DRC is confronting right now, from measles to cholera to widespread malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kaseya worries the deteriorating health situations could "be an entry point for a new pandemic," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"DRC has a very fragile health system, and USAID is an integral part of this fabric that is already stretched very, very thin," says Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, who has worked on mpox in the DRC for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without U.S. support, there will be "disastrous setbacks" for health in the DRC and because diseases don't respect borders, she worries, those setbacks could be felt elsewhere in the world, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests that antidepressants can accelerate cognitive decline in people with dementia. At the same time, some drugs appear to be less harmful than others, which can help doctors make better treatment decisions, according to the paper, "Antidepressant use and cognitive decline in patients with dementia: a national cohort study," &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03851-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;BMC Medicine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a new observational study based on data from the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem) shows that patients with dementia who are treated with antidepressants experience an increased &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; compared to patients who do not receive this medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is based on a comprehensive analysis of registry data from 18,740 patients, of whom approximately 23% were treated with antidepressants. During the course of the study, a total of 11,912 prescriptions of antidepressants were registered, with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/selective+serotonin+reuptake+inhibitors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs) accounting for 65%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Depressive symptoms can both worsen cognitive decline and impair quality of life, so it is important to treat them. Our results can help doctors and other health care professionals choose antidepressants that are better adapted for patients with dementia," says Sara Garcia Ptacek, researcher at the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, and the study's last author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers from Karolinska Institutet and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg have followed the patients' cognitive development over time and compared both medicated and non-medicated groups as well as different types of antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is not currently possible to determine whether the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; is due to the drugs or to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depressive+symptoms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; themselves, the researchers were able to see that antidepressants were associated with increased cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Differences between drugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also points to differences between different drugs. The SSRI escitalopram was associated with the fastest cognitive decline, followed by the SSRIs citalopram and sertraline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirtazapine, which has a different mechanism of action, had less negative cognitive impact than escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers now want to investigate whether certain patient groups, such as people with specific &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; types or biomarkers, respond better or worse to different &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antidepressants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The goal is to find these subgroups to create more individualized care," says Ptacek.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Selenium is a nutrient that plays a &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;crucial role in human health&lt;/a&gt;, contributing to the thyroid and immune function, DNA repair, and cardiovascular and cognitive health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It acts as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/add-antioxidants-to-your-diet/art-20546814"&gt;an antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; – substances that protect cells from unstable molecules that can damage DNA, proteins and cell membranes. It can even protect against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a vital &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218751/"&gt;trace element&lt;/a&gt; found in living organisms, soil and plants, and your body needs only a small amount of it to function. The recommended dietary allowance for selenium in adults is &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;55 micrograms per day&lt;/a&gt;, with an upper limit of 400 micrograms. In comparison, adults need between 900 to 10,000 micrograms daily of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-Consumer/"&gt;copper, another trace element&lt;/a&gt;, and between &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/zinc-Consumer/"&gt;8,000 to 40,000 micrograms&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/zinc-is-a-metal-essential-to-life-scienti-have-discovered-a-protein-that-helps-keep-cells-alive-when-zinc-levels-are-low-183083"&gt;trace element zinc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excess or deficiency of selenium can have significant health consequences. In my work as a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yI9ON-UAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;pharmaceutical science researcher&lt;/a&gt;, my colleagues and I study the potential use of selenium to boost the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A dose of selenium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium was &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Selenium"&gt;first discovered in 1817&lt;/a&gt; by chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius while analyzing an impurity in a batch of sulfuric acid produced in a factory in Sweden. Berzelius initially thought the material was the element tellurium, but he eventually realized that it was actually an unknown substance at the time. He named the mineral after &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Selene-Greek-and-Roman-mythology"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;, the Greek goddess of the Moon, because of its similarity to &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/element/Tellurium"&gt;tellurium&lt;/a&gt;, which had been named after the Roman goddess of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium exists in both organic and inorganic forms. &lt;a href="https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/2-5-organic-compounds-essential-to-human-functioning"&gt;Organic compounds&lt;/a&gt; contain carbon atoms and are typically derived from living organisms, while &lt;a href="https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/2-4-inorganic-compounds-essential-to-human-functioning"&gt;inorganic compounds&lt;/a&gt; do not have carbon atoms and generally originate from nonliving sources. Your cells chemically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042215"&gt;convert between these forms&lt;/a&gt; to carry out various physiological functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium deficiency is a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482260/"&gt;significant health issue&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in regions with selenium-poor soils, such as parts of China, Africa and Europe. Low selenium levels are associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700330"&gt;Keshan disease&lt;/a&gt;, a fatal heart condition, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1402559"&gt;Kashin-Beck disease&lt;/a&gt;, which affects joints and bones. Deficiency also weakens immune function, increasing susceptibility to infections.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Brazil nuts contain particularly high levels of selenium.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/brazil-nuts-royalty-free-image/2168604248"&gt;R.Tsubin/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consuming too much selenium is also an issue. Oversupplementation or excess environmental exposure can lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2009.495"&gt;selenosis, a condition&lt;/a&gt; with symptoms such as brittle hair and nails, digestive issues, skin rashes and neurological symptoms such as irritability and fatigue. In severe cases, selenium toxicity can result in organ failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium has a narrow &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/therapeutic-index"&gt;therapeutic window&lt;/a&gt;, which is the dosage range that provides safe and effective treatment with minimal harmful side effects. For example, selenium can either increase or decrease your body’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1385/BTER:81:3:189"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the dose. Adequate levels of selenium &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.120725"&gt;strengthen your immune cells’&lt;/a&gt; ability to fight infections and tumors, while excessive selenium intake can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700330"&gt;suppress immune responses&lt;/a&gt; by damaging immune tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selenium and cancer prevention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium may have the potential to treat and prevent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long studied selenium’s role in cancer prevention. Initially suspected to be a carcinogen, later studies found it had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042215"&gt;protective effects against liver damage&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1960s. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1945904/"&gt;researchers proposed&lt;/a&gt; that selenium could be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/PNS2005467"&gt;used to prevent cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a concept that gained further traction in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, large-scale clinical trials have produced mixed results. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/research/select-trial-results-qa"&gt;Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial&lt;/a&gt; was a study of over 35,500 men that ran from 2001 to 2004. They found that taking selenium daily &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2008.864"&gt;did not reduce prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; and may even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djt456"&gt;increase the risk of prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; in men with already high selenium levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings from a study conducted from 1983 to 1996, the &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/11/7/630/252474/Baseline-Characteristics-and-the-Effect-of"&gt;Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial&lt;/a&gt;, suggested selenium may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.15460"&gt;protect against prostate and other cancers&lt;/a&gt;. But researchers also observed a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djg061"&gt;heightened incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; among participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conflicting results may be due to the different forms of selenium each study tested, as well as differences in baseline selenium levels among participants. Other studies have found that selenium-contaminated water in a municipality of Italy has been &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/7/10/853/109604/Excess-melanoma-incidence-in-a-cohort-exposed-to"&gt;linked to an increased risk of melanoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The antioxidant effects of selenium vary depending on its dose.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.07.013"&gt;Razaghi et al./EJC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selenium and cancer treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium may also have the potential to stop cancer from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on the potential of using selenium to supplement chemotherapy for cancer treatment. Selenium compounds such as methylseleninic acid, or MSA, and seleno-L-methionine, or SLM, show promise in targeting proteins that drive tumor progression and treatment resistance. Studies from my team and I have found that MSA can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctarc.2025.100864"&gt;modulate key biochemical pathways&lt;/a&gt; related to kidney cancer by reducing levels of proteins that influence tumor growth and immune evasion. We also observed that SLM may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctarc.2025.100864"&gt;slow kidney tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; in mice without toxic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More significantly, in a Phase 1 clinical trial, we found that &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-3234/751353/Phase-I-Clinical-Trial-of-High-Doses-of-Seleno-L"&gt;combining SLM with the chemotherapy drug axitinib&lt;/a&gt; was effective in treating metastatic kidney cancer in patients, with minimal side effects. Of the 27 patients we treated, over half saw their tumors shrink in size, with a median overall survival of nearly 20 months. These findings suggest that selenium may have a synergistic effect on chemotherapy by making it more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further investigation into how selenium may help overcome treatment resistance and what doses are optimal will clarify its potential as a viable addition to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Striking the right balance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether as an immune booster or potential treatment for disease, the significance of selenium in human health is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12748"&gt;selenium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; – such as Brazil nuts, seafood, whole grains and eggs – can help sustain optimal nutrient levels. In regions with selenium-deficient soils, supplementation with medical supervision may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine line between benefit and harm underscores the importance of balanced intake and personalized approaches to selenium supplementation. As research continues, I believe selenium’s multifaceted role in health will become more clear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

These bacteria mutate to resist even the most powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently at a hospital in Nevada, a female patient who was admitted with pneumonia died from sepsis and multiple organ failure. The culprit was a bacteria that had adapted to resist as many as 26 different antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-possible-solution"&gt;A possible solution &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking steps in the fight against these deadly pathogens, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M&lt;/a&gt; have discovered something intriguing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found that curcumin, the compound that gives &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/turmeric-supplements-provide-yet-another-health-benefit-according-to-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt; its bright yellow color, may be able to reverse antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that curcumin, when presented to bacteria as a source of food and then triggered by light, causes destructive reactions within these microbes. These reactions eventually kill the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process effectively reduces the number of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-create-viruses-to-combat-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic-resistant&lt;/a&gt; strains, consequently making conventional antibiotics useful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-superbug-era"&gt;The superbug era&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the discovery of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotics-for-childhood-infections-are-becoming-ineffective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, infectious diseases were the top cause of death and disability globally. The introduction of these wonder drugs added 23 years to the average human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breathing-less-oxygen-could-extend-your-lifespan-by-50-or-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the development of new antibiotics has reached a plateau, resistant bacteria have surged – ushering in the superbug era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superbugs include methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt; (VRE), and certain drug-resistant strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria – all of which are notoriously difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vanderlei Bagnato, a professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the senior author of the study, shared his insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When bacteria start becoming resistant to conventional antibiotics, we have what we call an antibiotic catastrophe,” said Dr. Bagnato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To overcome this challenge, we need alternative ways to either kill the superbugs or find a novel way to modify natural processes within the bacteria so that antibiotics start to act again.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-battling-the-superbugs"&gt;Battling the superbugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural diversity within a bacterial population results in varied behaviors, including differences in antibiotic resistance. If certain strains can withstand antimicrobial drugs and continue to multiply, this diversity can contribute to increased resistance to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the Texas A&amp;amp;M study was to control this bacterial diversity to manage resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team applied a method known as photodynamic inactivation, which uses light and light-sensitive molecules known as photosensitizers to generate reactive oxygen species. These species can annihilate microorganisms by disrupting their metabolic processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, curcumin was used as the photosensitizer. The beauty of this approach is that curcumin also doubles as natural food for bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested this method on strains of &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; that are resistant to antibiotics such as amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria were subjected to multiple light exposure cycles. The team then compared the minimum antibiotic concentration needed to kill the bacteria following light exposure with those not exposed to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we have a mixed population of bacteria where some are resistant, we can use photodynamic inactivation to narrow the bacterial distribution, leaving behind strains that are more or less similar in their response to antibiotics. It’s much easier now to predict the precise antibiotic dose needed to remove the infection,” explained Dr. Bagnato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fight-against-resistance"&gt;The fight against resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are confident that photodynamic inactivation by curcumin would function well as a complement to antibiotics as a treatment for infections that are caused by drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Photodynamic inactivation offers a cost-effective treatment option, which is crucial for reducing medical expenses not only in developing countries but also in the United States,” said study co-author Dr. Vladislav Yakovlev. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also has potential applications in military medicine, where this technology could be used to treat battlefield wounds and prevent the development and spread of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antimicrobial-resistance-projected-to-kill-10-million-people-each-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;, a significant concern in combat situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study provide renewed hope in the fight against superbugs. By leveraging the potential of a common spice like turmeric, we may gain an advantage in this ongoing battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79743-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:27:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNT1NkVFVUZWltTC1UWXdTTEJwVzBsT3c0c0t0WDdISnlhaERyRG5CMTB0QmYtNFdidVFJdlBkX2lSVndya0xFeFVYV3ptU0dwNERIWXRWbk1tbDJydGR1dUt5TzRfUGdxelFMWEY4NF91R1UwVzcyaE94MzV4Yl82a3dqWnhYdDA</guid></item><item><title>Adverse Childhood Experiences Impact Brain Development and Mental Health - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPbHBGclMyVkZTc1dQRWM3ZkJ3NlhnRFB1S0pNSWJIcGpyYXhTTGpFSjBITHp6S24wOUlXVzNRN1cyVzdIb0k0dG5QN1FSNEloM3pNUHJaMjFET3N2M2laWllFNTFaVEZJbGFRZTJpQTVLY09XUWJmdjQ2X1hGRHNROFd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A decade-long study reveals how childhood adversity alters brain development, increasing risks for mental health disorders and substance use. Researchers found that teens who experienced early adversity showed delayed cognitive control, with unusual brain activity in regions linked to self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connectivity between key brain regions was a stronger predictor of substance use than behavioral control, suggesting neural patterns may indicate future risk. Despite these challenges, the brain’s resilience offers hope, as cognitive control function often improves in late adolescence, highlighting opportunities for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversity and Brain Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Early life adversity is linked to delayed brain maturation in areas responsible for focus and self-control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substance Use Prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain connectivity patterns, rather than behavioral control, were stronger predictors of future substance use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Delayed cognitive control in early adolescence often improves over time, suggesting the brain’s resilience to adversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While researchers have long spotlighted the role childhood abuse, poverty, and substance use play in human development, Virginia Tech’s Jungmeen Kim-Spoon is pulling back the curtain on what actually happens inside the brains of the young adults affected. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past 10 years, Kim-Spoon and her colleague Brooks Casas have co-led a research team that has tracked the brain function of teens. They found adolescents who experienced early life adversity showed unusual brain activity during tasks that require focus and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture decoding="async" class="wp-image-107941"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a young girl and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/childhood-adversity-brain-development-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Some of the group’s findings also illustrate the brain’s resiliency. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests delayed development in certain areas of the brain, which is linked to higher risks for mental health disorders in early adulthood and future substance use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that early adverse experiences not only predict and impact mental health such as depression and anxiety, but also affect brain development,” said Kim-Spoon, professor of psychology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-of-its-kind study recently resulted in two published journal articles, one in &lt;em&gt;Development and Psychopathology&lt;/em&gt; and another in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;. The former discusses findings related to maltreatment, brain development related to cognitive control, and psychopathology. The latter focuses on connectivity between neural circuits of the brain as a predictor of substance use initiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jungmeen said that despite the well documented connection between adverse experiences and the development of mental health disorders, the lack of available information on exactly how adolescents are impacted internally motivated the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By age 18, more than half of adults in the United States have experienced at least one type of adversity,” said Kim-Spoon, who is also director of the&lt;a href="https://jklifespan.wixsite.com/mysite"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;JK Lifespan Development Lab at Virginia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet our understanding about how adverse experiences may alter the ways in which the brain and nervous system change over time, increasing vulnerability to mental health and substance use disorders, remains vastly insufficient.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her collaborators set out to investigate this by recruiting adolescents from rural, suburban, and urban communities in Southwest Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 10 years, they tracked participant brain function, neural precursors – neurobiological markers in the developing brain – and other developmental check points through annual MRI scanning, questionnaires, and neurocognitive testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team includes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Casas, professor with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and the Department of Psychology of the Virginia Tech College of Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The late Warren Bickel, professor with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and the Department of Psychology of the College of Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stephen LaConte, professor with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics of the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tae-Ho Lee, associate professor of psychology at Virginia Tech   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kirby Deater-Deckard, professor of psychological and brain sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ family dynamics, decision-making skills, substance use initiation and frequency, personality factors, and social relationships were also assessed yearly with the goal of providing a well-rounded view of the factors impacting the adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jungmeen and I get to tackle thorny problems while pursuing answers to questions that matter for promoting healthier youth development,” Deater-Deckard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team utilizes state-of-the-art quantitative modeling techniques to integrate complex arrays of data from many sources such as surveys, observations, and brain imaging. She has helped me understand the complex changes in health and functioning over time.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also annually observed adolescents with no prior history of substance use in the same study sample from ages 14 to 21 over a period of seven years. Their findings suggest brain connectivity — the pattern of connections between different parts of the brain — rather than cognitive control behavior — the ability to adapt your behavior to meet your goals, and to override automatic responses — was the stronger predictor of future substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, stronger connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — two brain regions that are crucial to cognitive control — was associated with delayed substance use onset, and this connectivity pattern showed a significant drop one year prior to substance use initiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the group’s findings also illustrate the brain’s resiliency. Although cognitive control brain functioning is delayed in early adolescence following childhood maltreatment, the findings suggest it often “catches up” during middle to late adolescence, suggesting neural plasticity and opportunities to help these young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By conducting more research on neural plasticity during adolescence, we can shed light on the brain’s potential as a target for preventive interventions, aimed at promoting resilient functioning in young people facing adversity,” Kim-Spoon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fueled by these results and supported by several grants from the National Institutes of Health to Kim-Spoon and Casas as well as the Virginia Tech Institute for Society, Culture and Environment, Kim-Spoon and the research team plans to continue this study for another five years. As the participants enter their 20s, the team will focus more on examining their relationships, networks, and social environments to understand how they contribute to the ways young people navigate unique challenges in early adulthood.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This longitudinal project has been very rewarding especially in terms of collaborating with brilliant minds within Virginia Tech and outside,” Kim-Spoon said. “It has been fun to look into the things we can do to help young people develop healthier, and it will be interesting to see what we will find in the next few years.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By expanding this research, Kim-Spoon and her collaborators can contribute to the development of effective resilience and protective strategies to help people at higher risk of developing mental health and addiction problems improve their future well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim-Spoon said she believes we are just beginning to better understand the factors affecting young people’s mental health, substance use, and well-being by examining how brain function and development interact with social and emotional dynamics, and spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adverse experiences, no matter how we view them, are tough, but there are things we can do to help these young people develop healthier, such as access to parental support, education, and positive experiences with peer groups,” Kim-Spoon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment and childhood adversity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85e8eee4f6ede7f0f7ebc5f3f1abe0e1f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Margaret Ashburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Margaret Ashburn – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orignial Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954579424000531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychopathology as long-term sequelae of maltreatment and socioeconomic disadvantage: Neurocognitive development perspectives&lt;/a&gt;” by Kim-Spoon et al. &lt;em&gt;Development and Psychopathology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2024.11.020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neural Signatures of Cognitive Control Predict Future Adolescent Substance Use Onset and Frequency&lt;/a&gt;” by Kim-Spoon et al.&lt;em&gt; Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Signatures of Cognitive Control Predict Future Adolescent Substance Use Onset and Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescent substance use is a significant predictor of future addiction and related disorders. Understanding neural mechanisms underlying substance use initiation and frequency during adolescence is critical for early prevention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current longitudinal study followed 91 substance-naïve adolescents annually for 7 years from ages 14 to 21 years to identify potential neural precursors that predict substance use initiation and frequency. Cognitive control processes were examined using the Multi-Source Interference Task to assess functional neural connectivity. A questionnaire was used to assess substance use frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) at time 1 predicted a delayed onset of substance use, indicative of a protective effect. A notable decline in this dACC–dlPFC connectivity was observed 1 year prior to substance use initiation. Conversely, lower connectivity of the dACC with the supplementary motor area and heightened connectivity of the anterior insula with the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus were predictive of greater frequency of future substance use. These findings remained after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the critical role of cognitive control–related neural connectivity in predicting substance use initiation and frequency during adolescence. The results imply that efforts to strengthen and monitor the development of the top-down cognitive control system in the brain from early adolescence can be protective and deter progression into problematic substance use. Furthermore, for adolescents with heightened frequency of substance use, interventions may prove more effective by targeting interoceptive processes in cognitive control training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychopathology as long-term sequelae of maltreatment and socioeconomic disadvantage: Neurocognitive development perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience research underscores the critical impact of adverse experiences on brain development. Yet, there is limited understanding of the specific pathways linking adverse experiences to accelerated or delayed brain development and their ultimate contributions to psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we present new longitudinal data demonstrating that neurocognitive functioning during adolescence, as affected by adverse experiences, predicts psychopathology during young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included 167 participants (52% male) assessed in adolescence and young adulthood. Adverse experiences were measured by early maltreatment experiences and low family socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control was assessed by neural activation and behavioral performance during the Multi-Source Interference Task. Psychopathology was measured by self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that higher maltreatment predicted heightened frontoparietal activation during cognitive control, indicating delayed neurodevelopment, which, in turn predicted higher internalizing and externalizing symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, higher maltreatment predicted a steeper decline in frontoparietal activation across adolescence, indicating neural plasticity in cognitive control-related brain development, which was associated with lower internalizing symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results elucidate the crucial role of neurocognitive development in the processes linking adverse experiences and psychopathology. Implications of the findings and directions for future research on the effects of adverse experiences on brain development are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 13:23:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPbHBGclMyVkZTc1dQRWM3ZkJ3NlhnRFB1S0pNSWJIcGpyYXhTTGpFSjBITHp6S24wOUlXVzNRN1cyVzdIb0k0dG5QN1FSNEloM3pNUHJaMjFET3N2M2laWllFNTFaVEZJbGFRZTJpQTVLY09XUWJmdjQ2X1hGRHNROFd3</guid></item><item><title>'I’m 92 and feel 50 – here’s the workout routine I swear by, and how to get started in your 60s' - Women's Health UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOaV9fVVRTU0ZWeE1NUjNZVW4tM3hxbF9hY2NkNE16QW5UbE9lb1lyQnhNYlFVN2FUVi1aU1l0bmpTcnhFdmJ6Mm9EdlRSS3NiV3cyZmd5SzdrWmNWTGRTdXVNbERWT3lvdWYyYUg5ejlocnA3ZFdieVp3ZTB4dU5WUVpSeUg2TjhwdVJXMTN6Ym5jMVJEQl9V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Imagine being 92 and driving yourself to the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a705924/best-gyms-in-london/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a705924/best-gyms-in-london/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gym" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; four days a week, doing deep &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a708464/how-to-squat-properly/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a708464/how-to-squat-properly/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="squats" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/a39595079/25-7-2-workout/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/a39595079/25-7-2-workout/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="climbing the stairs" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;climbing the stairs&lt;/a&gt; with ease.

Her daughter shared a video of Giordano’s full mobility routine, including a supine hamstring stretch, figure four glute stretch, modified pigeon stretch, supine lower back stretch, bridge walks, roll-ups, butterfly groin stretch, and sit-to-stands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;She starts every strength training workout with dynamic mobility exercises to prime the muscles she's about to work (like leg swings and deep squats before a lower-body strength session, as seen in the video of Giordano's park workout above), and finishes with static stretches targeting the same muscles. Studies show that static stretches are more beneficial when performed in a cooldown (as opposed to a warmup) as they can benefit muscle recovery by reducing stiffness and decreasing DOMS, while other &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274517864_Acute_Changes_in_Autonomic_Nerve_Activity_during_Passive_Static_Stretching" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274517864_Acute_Changes_in_Autonomic_Nerve_Activity_during_Passive_Static_Stretching" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that static stretching after a workout downregulates your nervous system and activates the parasympathetic response, making you feel calmer after training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In the caption, Radtke writes: ‘My mum’s incredibly youthful mobility didn’t happen overnight.

No frills, no fancy gym, no special equipment.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="36" class="body-h4 css-lviy4r emevuu60"&gt;4. NEAT exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Speaking on &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;, Radtke added that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/fat-loss/a36287384/neat-exercise/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/fat-loss/a36287384/neat-exercise/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NEAT exercise" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;NEAT exercise&lt;/a&gt; (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis – the type of movement you don’t realise you’re doing every day) is also important for Giordano. She says she always takes the stairs, stays active throughout the day, and looks for opportunities to bolster her mobility. For example, Giordano is responsible for gardening at her apartment building and spends a few hours doing this every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Radke says: ‘That’s my message, that you don’t need to be in a gym to be fit.

It’s treated with a vast number of methods, from ear lavage to local anesthetics, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/antidepressants-could-significantly-improve-brain-function-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and sedatives, with different results.” The lack of a consistent solution underscores the urgent need for better treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Panhóca and his team conducted an extensive study on alternative and complementary therapies. Over four weeks, they examined treatment responses in more than 100 individuals aged 18 to 65. Participants, randomly assigned to ten groups, received different therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer strong evidence that low-level laser therapy and photobiomodulation outperform conventional treatments. By targeting affected areas with precise light wavelengths, these methods appear to stimulate cellular repair and reduce tinnitus severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-drug-reverses-groin-hernias-without-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, which often produce inconsistent outcomes, light-based therapies provide a non-invasive alternative with minimal side effects. Researchers believe this approach could soon become a primary treatment option for tinnitus sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These therapies included laser acupuncture, flunarizine dihydrochloride, Ginkgo biloba, and low-level laser stimulation of the internal auditory canal (transmeatal stimulation), both alone and in combination with various adjunct therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient underwent eight bi-weekly treatment sessions and was assessed using a "tinnitus handicap inventory questionnaire" featuring 25 questions.

Additionally, combinations of laser therapy with vacuum therapy or Ginkgo biloba, as well as laser acupuncture alone and flunarizine dihydrochloride alone, also demonstrated lasting therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Barplot comparing the non-normalized TH1 scores at T0, T1 and T2 between tinnitus treatment modalities explored in this study (from G1 to G10).

We believe laser therapy can increase peripheral irrigation, which may be the main cause of the problem in many cases, as well as stimulating inner ear cell proliferation and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-invent-artificial-knee-cartilage-that-is-better-than-the-real-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;collagen production&lt;/a&gt;." These findings suggest that low-level laser therapy may address underlying factors contributing to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="standardizing_treatment_protocols"&gt;Standardizing Treatment Protocols&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the efficacy of laser therapy in alleviating tinnitus is not entirely novel, the CEPOF study makes significant strides towards standardizing treatment protocols. This development holds great promise for healthcare professionals, including dentists, ear, nose, and throat specialists, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/music-helps-patients-with-dementia-connect-with-loved-ones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;speech therapists&lt;/a&gt;, who treat tinnitus patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the literature lacks consensus on the optimal number of sessions and treatment intensity, making it challenging to provide consistent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Comparison between study groups showing the evolution of different interventions to treat tinnitus.

He's a word-of-mouth kind of doctor who has no need for advertising. And he's the &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; person I trust to inject anything into my face (I'm a health expert, not a nun!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the needles penetrated my skin, we fell into our routine quarterly catch-up. The download began. Apparently, the so-called 'Ozempic Face' is real – and far worse than anyone thought, he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From Hollywood's elites to suburban moms, Wall Street execs and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-55fd9040-f185-11ef-a1d7-855d0ee76b5a"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; influencers, Ozempic, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-55f86020-f185-11ef-a1d7-855d0ee76b5a"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug-turned-weight-loss sensation, has permeated every corner of our culture. The promise of effortless &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-55fe7aa0-f185-11ef-a1d7-855d0ee76b5a"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; is too intoxicating to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just look at the &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14428333/Skinny-stars-SAG-Awards-Ozempic-craze.html"&gt;slew of underweight A-listers&lt;/a&gt; on the red carpet at Sunday’s &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/sag_awards/index.html" id="mol-c53446a0-f2b3-11ef-bd11-035a27bd339d"&gt;SAG Awards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We're bombarded with stories of how what are known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic (and Mounjaro, Wegovy and the rest) are the new Holy Grail of health, offering myriad other benefits as the pounds fall off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But what is conveniently swept under the rug are the horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The potential side effects that are most commonly discussed — thyroid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-54d04ed0-f2cd-11ef-93c9-d3c6e5676507" class="class"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, pancreatitis, stomach paralysis — should be enough to make anyone reconsider. But what if I told you that's just the warm-up act?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The other day I went to see a plastic surgeon who just happens to be Beverly Hills' best-kept secret. (pictured: Jillian Michaels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Apparently, the so-called 'Ozempic Face' is real - and far worse than anyone thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My plastic surgeon isn't the only clinician spilling the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I work with MDs and PhDs across every specialty — psychiatrists, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, nutrition scientists. Not one of them has failed to mention, in hushed tones, the 'observational adverse events' they see with GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Why whisper? Because questioning the safety of this medical 'miracle' is career suicide in today's climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pharma-industrial complex, backed by regulatory bodies and media puppets, has turned medicine into a religion where blind faith replaces scientific debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of these 'whispered' potential side-effects you may have heard about: Ozempic Face, of course, but also hair loss and diminished libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others, you likely haven't: gastric bezoars (hard indigestible masses that can form in the gut), or suicidal ideation, accelerated aging and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But to return to 'Ozempic Face': many have assumed that it's simply the result of reduced facial volume due to weight loss that leaves many people looking older than before. However, based on my extensive professional experience of helping people lose weight over the years, I've never seen them look older — only younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To be honest, I hadn't given this issue much thought, as I've been more focused on the potentially life-threatening side effects of the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That changed the day my surgeon told me his patients on GLP-1 medications were 'aging in fast-forward', with some looking a decade older in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said, their skin didn't just &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;appear &lt;/span&gt;older — it was &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;behaving &lt;/span&gt;older, losing elasticity, with more wrinkles and crepiness, and healing more slowly. Even the connective tissue or SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System), which structurally supports the face, was becoming thinner and weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It seems that GLP-1 drugs may be accelerating the breakdown of structural proteins like collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, I dug into the literature for answers and found a couple of studies suggesting GLP-1 drugs potentially deactivated fat-derived stem cells in the upper dermal layers. These stem cells play a crucial role in skin integrity, as they release messengers that stimulate fibroblasts to produce the key building blocks that maintain youthful, resilient skin. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then there's the impact on the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Sabine Hazan, a gastroenterologist, warned me about the potential dangers of GLP-1 drugs delaying gastric emptying — a technical way of saying food lingers in the gut like a Thanksgiving dinner that never digests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She worried this could disrupt the gut microbiome, the trillions of microbes essential for digestion, immunity, and overall health. She also speculated that reduced gut motility might lead to conditions like SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), a gruesome affliction that brings bloating, brain fog, mood swings, and makes one poo puddles of tar (&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;not &lt;/span&gt;hyperbole). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For one of my podcasts, I interviewed Dr. Heather Heying, PhD, who raised similar concerns. She pointed out that severely slowed gut motility could have long-term consequences, including a number of conditions that are associated with stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once again, I went hunting through the literature for what other dangers might be being overlooked. What I found was terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several studies have documented large gastric bezoars in patients on GLP-1 drugs. These dense lumps of food, mucus or medication residue harden into rock-like formations in the stomach. Think of them as the human equivalent of a clogged garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;We're bombarded with stories of how what are known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic (and Mounjaro, Wegovy and the rest) are the new Holy Grail of health, offering myriad other benefits as the pounds fall off. But what is conveniently swept under the rug are the horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The conversation around these drugs is overwhelmingly focused on their benefits, while potentially serious risks are downplayed or dismissed. People deserve full, honest information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left untreated, these bezoars grow, some swelling to the size of a grapefruit, causing unrelenting nausea, vomiting and intense abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In worst-case scenarios, they lead to life-threatening blockages, eroding the stomach lining, triggering infections, and may require surgical removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Right when you think it couldn't get worse — caved-in faces and putrid balls of undigested sludge — a growing number of weight-loss jab users report yet another unexpected side effect: a plummeting libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Let's be real. Weight loss is supposed to boost your sex life, not destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of my go-to motivators for male contestants on the TV series &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/span&gt; was telling them their erections were about to get a serious upgrade. (Fun fact: for every 10-20 pounds lost, roughly half an inch of buried shaft is 'recovered'.) And thanks to improved cardiovascular function, blood flow increases make those erections stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But here's the problem: Some men on Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs are reporting alarming drops in testosterone and, well, difficulty getting it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women, meanwhile, are also experiencing plummeting libido, feeling disconnected from intimacy and joy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several psychiatrists I've interviewed suspect it stems from how these drugs alter the way dopamine (the brain's feel-good hormone) works, and how they appear to impact gut-brain communication and hormone balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By delaying gastric emptying and suppressing cravings, GLP-1 drugs blunt the brain's reward system, which controls not just food-seeking behavior but also motivation and pleasure — including sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Changes in gut microbiome composition also affect neurotransmitter production, so it's no wonder some users find their sex drive plummeting. While some report a boost in confidence and energy as they lose weight, others have described feeling emotionally dulled, disinterested in intimacy, and even disconnected from joy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day, I don't judge anyone who chooses the weight-loss jab path — everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body. But what is unacceptable is the lack of transparent conversation about the true trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The conversation around these drugs is overwhelmingly focused on their benefits, while potentially serious risks are downplayed or dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People should be having full, honest discussions so they can make the most educated decision for themselves — one that isn't clouded by all the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because when the stakes are this high, no one should unknowingly enter into a bargain with the devil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This chart shows declining brain function scores among those taking SSRis (red line) and those not on antidepressants (blue line)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect was even greater for SSRIs specifically with scores declining by an extra 0.39 points per year and those on higher doses saw a decline of 0.42 points per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors said while this difference was large enough to observe the actual impact it would have on patients was clinically 'uncertain'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Publishing the results in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03851-3#Sec9"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists also found patients on antidepressants had a 7 per cent greater chance of death and 18 per cent greater risk of suffering a fracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on higher doses of SSRIs were 35 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with severe dementia, an 18 per cent higher chance of death, and a 25 per cent higher of breaking a bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the experts added that they weren't able to pin these finding on the drugs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said it was possible the poorer health outcomes were a result of the depression the drugs were meant to treat rather than the medication itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An additional finding was that a subset of dementia patients, those suffering from frontotemporal dementia, which typically strikes younger people, had a slower rate of disease progression when taking antidepressants.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Tara Spires-Jones, an expert in dementia and president of the British Neuroscience Association, said while the findings were 'strong' there were limitations and more research was needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But they can also be a sign of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly 1million Brits and 7million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer. It marks a 40 per cent uptick on the previous forecast in 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People who needed antidepressants may have had more aggressive disease or the depression itself could have been affecting disease progression,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Previous studies have also reported mixed results, highlighting the need for more research before we have a full understanding of the effects of antidepressant use on dementia progression.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Richard Oakley, associate director for research and innovation of the Alzheimer’s Society, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study suggested that antidepressants led to faster rates of memory and thinking decline in people with dementia but it did not rule out the possibility that the changes were due to the presence of depression rather than antidepressant use, so further research is needed to understand the effects of antidepressants,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Prasad Nishtala, an expert in life sciences at the University of Bath, said the study also couldn't explain how antidepressants were accelerating cognitive decline and also called for further research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Because of these limitations, the study’s findings should be interpreted with caution and ideally replicated using other real-world data sources,' he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dementia affects an estimated one million people in the UK and has a variety of causes, such as Alzheimer's disease and reduced blood flow to the brain following a stroke, known as vascular dementia.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent analysis by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-53328900-bdf6-11ef-9b24-67aee2c8b58d" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; Society estimated the overall annual cost of the dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An ageing population means these costs – which include lost earnings of unpaid carers – are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 944,000 in the UK are thought to be living with dementia while the figure is thought to be around 7million in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Each hour a person spends squinting into a smartphone or staring at a &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/eye-care/staring-at-screens-can-cause-eye-strain-heres-tips-to-prevent-that-2"&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt; increases their risk of nearsightedness, a new evidence review suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every daily one-hour increment in digital screen time is associated with 21% higher odds of myopia, researchers reported recently in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830598"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the risk continues to increase as more time each day is spent with screens, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Myopia risk increased significantly from 1 to 4 hours of screen time and then rose more gradually thereafter,” the research team led by &lt;a href="https://snucm.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/y-kim-41"&gt;Young Kook Kim&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of ophthalmology with the Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of nearsightedness is doubled for people who spend four or more hours with a screen every day, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review suggests a “potential safety threshold of less than 1 hour per day of exposure, with an increase in odds up to 4 hours,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2050, nearly one-half of the world’s population is expected to be nearsighted, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearsightedness is when close-up objects look clear but distant objects appear blurry, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a nearsighted person can read a map but has trouble seeing well enough to drive a car without glasses or contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The projected surge in myopia cases is likely fueled by environmental factors prevalent in urbanized societies, with major contributors being increased near-vision activities and reduced outdoor time,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartphones, tablets and other screens have “introduced new forms of near-work activity,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As children increasingly embrace smart devices at younger ages and spend more time on digital screens, there is an urgent need to better understand the association of digital screen time with myopia,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the new paper, researchers pooled data from 45 prior studies involving more than 335,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data showed a significant dose-response association. In other words, the more time people spent with screens, the greater their risk for nearsightedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This risk is independent of other activities that require people to work their near vision, like reading or writing, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is also likely that digital screen use and other near-vision tasks collectively contribute to myopia risk, potentially influencing the overall dose-response trend,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that simply reducing screen time in favor of traditional near-vision activities may not be an effective prevention strategy,” researchers added. “A more effective approach to the mitigation of myopia risk would involve minimizing overall near-work activities while promoting increased outdoor time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Scientists at Northwestern University in the US have found the brew removes charged atoms, or ions, of heavy metals from water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Benjamin Shindel, the first author of the research, said that while scientists might consider whether the flavour chemicals in tea were driving associated health benefits, the new study suggested an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I think the one possible better explanation might be that it’s because it’s removing metals from water,” he said, adding the team found a cup of black tea brewed for five minutes reduced the concentration of lead ions in water by about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While the team did not test the possible ramifications for health, Shindel said that even in a country such as the UK, where lead levels in drinking water are unlikely to be high, there could be a small effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s possible that on the margins, tea consumption is reducing [people’s] metal intake by a very small amount, and perhaps over the population of the UK, that’s reducing diseases associated with metal consumption by another commensurately very small amount,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Among other studies, previous research has suggested people who drink tea may have&lt;a

They then checked the concentration of these ions after different periods of steeping, using solutions without tea as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Working with black tea, they found the brew reduced the concentration of all the metal ions tested, including lead, chromium and cadmium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They then focused on lead, finding longer brewing times of black tea and higher temperatures of water were associated with a greater reduction in the concentration of lead ions. What is more, ground tea had a greater effect than whole leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team also found that, at least for the batches they tested, black, green and white teas reduced the concentration of lead ions in the water to a greater degree than camomile, rooibos and oolong teas when left to steep for 24 hours to reach equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the case of bagged tea, the materials also mattered, with empty cellulose bags found to reduce the concentration of lead ions, whereas empty cotton and nylon bags did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Michelle Francl of Bryn Mawr College in the US and the author of Steeped: The Chemistry of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/tea" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Tea&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the work, said: “If you are concerned about heavy metals in your water, don’t think that drinking tea is the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, she added that the study “suggests some interesting directions” for developing sustainable and accessible ways to “removing contaminants from water, a critical need in many parts of the world”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNVUxRaGF2RGtoSVRpWHlVY0FJVC1yWVFCdUlBSGdzNElPc0FfNEtvOHB5enlwbWJKeWJKcTlMNHc4MkxWMFkyZ1FScVdPNTUwdlZ5cDNwc0hmaWFGcE1yN0JRczJ1U2FaU1dDb19mUlQ1b0VVZlJjTXppdEFrSGJmQkM2OS1mVUdsN2VJX0U0b1FGOU5NaVpr</guid></item><item><title>With avian flu flying around, is it safe to enjoy eggs? - The Mercury News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQRHJ4ZHFIQXVvNDNhTU5PdEFiVjluZXdxRHk0YWdodU1GNnFYcl9pNVZrRTdHUklDSG1lOFNhUUtMTE1tWkRUcTc2M25CVmxEWU5ERjNhcGVxVjBBcWFoZnlGclNocHJjeEExeng0a291Nk9HalBQTUZhTXdmekdrUEloYm5QaVpPQjdIelgxZGxCVmZ0RlBXSdIBngFBVV95cUxPZDNSMllEblRFTm9qeVVZRDhJblpSTldwczBfRGJXQTUta2Ffb3NSdFdvSFFTSTZXMm1rZ2dtSUdBMmdEWlVEaXJVVE03clQ5Wk40cXFwREVnY1pNZ0dQYm9wV0N5R2MwYURUNUczRmlKX0RibmFmdi1WMmJzbXJ3NXRsSjlQRFdvdE5DcWdSdWtlRkQwTUEwdnN2WF9wQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy mng-subscriber-content"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/01/07/normal-egg-prices-months-away-analyst-says/"&gt;Ever-rising egg prices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/10/trader-joes-and-costco-are-limiting-how-many-eggs-people-can-buy/"&gt;supply shortages,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2025/02/10/police-try-crack-case-after-more-than-500-eggs-stolen-restaurant/"&gt;egg thefts&lt;/a&gt; and reports of bodegas selling &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/egg-prices-bronx-bodegas/"&gt;loose eggs&lt;/a&gt; confirm strong demand for the kitchen staple even as avian flu infects and kills more of the birds that produce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as consumers eat their breakfasts, they may wonder whether the health risk is increasing as the virus spreads to species beyond birds, prompting &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/bird-flu-cows-cats-human-transmission-7adf14ec"&gt;scientists to sound the alarm&lt;/a&gt; that the H5N1 virus is mutating faster than anyone might know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/22/san-jose-olivera-egg-ranch-bird/"&gt;San Jose’s Olivera Egg Ranch to close after 76 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food safety experts maintain the risk of contracting bird flu by touching or consuming eggs remains very low. And despite a strain of bird flu &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-virus-type-h5n1-us-dairy-cattle"&gt;that has hit 747 dairy cattle herds in California alone,&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="http://Despite%20a%20more%20active%20outbreak%20of%20a%20new%20strain%20of%20bird%20flu%20that%20has%20hit%20cattle%20and%20dairy%20workers,%20and%20an%20announcement%20a%20year%20ago%20by%20the%20U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration%20(FDA)%20that%20the"&gt;announcement nearly a year ago by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; that one in five milk samples from grocery stores already tested positive for the virus, authorities say that non-raw milk products such as soft cheese and yogurt are safe for consumption as long as they have been pasteurized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given federal funding freezes, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/19/gongloff-trumps-climate-data-purge-hurts-americans-health-and-wallets/"&gt;removal of scientific data and information from governmental websites&lt;/a&gt;, threats to future research, and an overall air of uncertainty surrounding public messaging by the new Trump administration, how can anyone be sure their risk is low?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maurice Ernest Pitesky, associate professor at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and an expert in disease modeling for avian flu, explains why it’s unlikely that you’ll get a bad egg. This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;  Do U.S. Department of Agriculture or state inspectors test for bird flu inside the egg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;No. When you get sick birds, that’s when the surveillance starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;So why shouldn’t we be worried about avian flu inside of eggs if not on the shell? For example, is it true that an infected bird doesn’t have time to lay another egg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. When laying hens get sick, they basically stop egg production. A couple scenarios could happen in &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;. You could have an egg pop out right after the bird is infected. And maybe there’s feces on the egg and that feces has some of the virus on it. And maybe the virus gets inside the egg. But the virus is more in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tissue of birds. It’s not like milk, where the compartment where the animal produces the virus the most in is the milk-producing parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What if we were to end up getting the leftover eggs from infected flocks that had to be culled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; If there was an infected house and there are a handful of those eggs and those eggs were exposed — Americans eat over a trillion eggs a year. That’s literally a drop in an ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have slightly differing advice on the minimum temperature at which to cook eggs in order to stay completely safe from contamination. The &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/safe-temperature-chart"&gt;FDA says 160 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/food-safety.html"&gt;CDC says 165 degrees&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, this means cooking the egg all the way through, whether it’s a chicken, duck or quail egg, or a &lt;em&gt;balut &lt;/em&gt;fetal egg (duck or quail) designated as an ethnic egg product rather than a shell egg. But &lt;a href="https://eggsafety.org/faq/what-is-the-best-temperature-to-cook-an-egg/"&gt;many methods of common egg preparation&lt;/a&gt; fall below the recommended safety thresholds. Will indulging in sunny side-up eggs with pancakes, soft-boiled eggs in ramen, or raw eggs cracked into boiling soups at home or at a favorite restaurant lead to somewhat greater risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re talking about an outlier scenario. So, could I be talking about steak tartare with an egg yolk on top of it that happened to have the virus in it? And then maybe you rub your eyes or something because human cases have been more conjunctival, as is the case in dairy farms? I would see that as such a low-risk event. I’m pretty cautious as a scientist and also as a parent, and even now, I don’t see it as a major risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;For people who get their eggs from a noncommercial source, such as their own backyard flock: Is it a good idea to wash egg shells off at home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; No. I tell people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to wash their eggs, because most of the ways that people wash them have the potential to drive bacteria back into the egg. Don’t wash the eggs but make sure the eggs are being laid right in the nest box, collect them at least every 24 to 36 hours, and refrigerate them right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;So we really don’t have to worry at all about eggs and bird flu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s biology, so it’s hard to say, “No, that’s never going to happen,” but I’d worry more about salmonella than I would about getting avian flu from table eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a salmonella outbreak in eggs &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-salmonella-eggs-sept-2024#:~:text=As%20of%20October%2017%2C%202024,Wisconsin%2C%20Illinois%2C%20and%20Michigan."&gt;sickened 93 people across 12 states&lt;/a&gt;. Three of the egg consumers affected resided in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitesky is far more concerned about the impacts of backyard flocks and their owners’ behaviors on the outbreak. Hobbyists with chickens that happen to lay eggs are not subject to the same regulations as commercial egg producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other things at the top of Pitesky’s mind are the &lt;a href="http://dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/BirdFluFactSheet-Workers.pdf"&gt;occupational hazards faced by dairy workers&lt;/a&gt; and “cats infected with raw milk and raw turkey from infected carcasses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest issue is that the virus is now zoonotic — we’re having more and more humans that have been infected,” he said. “We’re really worried about it being human-to-human transmission eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the evidence is murky, and physicians do not routinely recommend the practice in the perioperative period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing guidelines on the use of vitamin D do not address the potential benefits of supplementation for improving outcomes after arthroplasty. The topic has become more important, as the number of patients undergoing joint replacement is growing. According to the &lt;a href="https://rheumatology.org/patients/joint-replacement-surgery"&gt;American College of Rheumatology&lt;/a&gt;, about 790,000 total knee replacements and 549,000 hip replacements are performed each year in the United States. One &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/jbjsoa/fulltext/2023/03000/projections_and_epidemiology_of_primary_hip_and.22.aspx"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; projected that by 2060, the number of these surgeries would grow to nearly 3 million and 2 million, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claudette M. Lajam, MD, professor of orthopedic surgery and system chief of orthopedic safety and quality at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York City, said emerging research shows vitamin D deficiency may correlate with poorer outcomes after elective total joint replacement. Several randomized trials conducted over the past 5 years compared outcomes of people who were given a supplement with the outcomes of those who had surgery in the past and may or may not have had low vitamin D levels. The results are conflicting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.arthroplastyjournal.org/article/S0883-5403(22)00776-8/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found supplementation on the day of knee replacement failed to demonstrate statistical significant differences in function or complications in the early postoperative period compared with placebo. &lt;a href="https://www.arthroplastyjournal.org/article/S0883-5403(24)00445-5/fulltext"&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; study found the total number of complications, superficial wound infection, and postoperative cellulitis were greater in people who did not receive vitamin D supplementation prior to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rub is that we can’t show for sure that managing vitamin D deficiency helps with outcomes after hip and knee replacement. But if your levels are low, it’s a good idea to consider supplementation before elective surgery,” Lajam, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, said. “If there is a potential benefit and there’s no real harm, why wouldn’t you do it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Endocrine Society issued &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/109/8/1907/7685305?login=false"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that recommend healthy adults younger than 75 years to not take vitamin D supplements at doses higher than the daily dietary intakes recommended by the Institute of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is in the process of updating its &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2678622"&gt;2018 recommendation statement&lt;/a&gt; on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults. The 2018 document does not address vitamin D use in joint replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a gap in guidance that might leave clinicians confused about what to tell otherwise healthy patients considering joint replacement, some experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linda Russell, MD, director of Perioperative Medicine at the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City, said HSS does not assess vitamin D status in all patients as part of preoperative lab testing, in part because of cost considerations. But she said she thinks doing so is wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21796828/"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; helps the body absorb calcium, which strengthens bones, and may reduce &lt;a href="https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/2/85"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are factors in recovering from joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/983283"&gt;Periprosthetic fracture&lt;/a&gt; above or below the orthopedic implant is another concern for which vitamin D status may be important. The proportion of patients who experience a perioprosthetic fracture within five years of total hip arthroplasty is 0.9% and after total knee arthroplasty is 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell said many patients have osteoporosis and are susceptible to a periprosthetic fracture if they fall. HSS recommends postmenopausal women and men older than 70 years who are undergoing arthroplasty receive a bone density test if they have not had one in the past 2 years to determine if they have osteoporosis, she said. If they do, their vitamin D levels are tested, and they are treated for any vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It makes a lot of sense that if you’re going to have an orthopedic procedure, if you’re going to have a joint replacement, you would like to ensure that the patient’s getting sufficient calcium and vitamin D preoperatively, both to promote bone and muscle health, because you don’t want patients to fall postoperatively. And vitamin D level has been tied to an increased rate of falls” if it is low, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature Meta-analyses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Piuzzi, MD, associate professor of orthopedic surgery and co-director of the Musculoskeletal Research Center at Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, said he often recommends measuring vitamin D levels as part of preoperative testing even if doing so is not standard of care. “We need to look at a lot of factors, and vitamin D is one of those that is relevant because it affects so many aspects of the surgery, specifically bone health,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piuzzi co-authored a 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0972978X20300945?via%3Dihub"&gt;review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that found a pooled prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency of 53.4% and vitamin D deficiency of 39.4% among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said although some studies reported higher rates of complications in patients with vitamin D deficiency, there was wide heterogeneity among the studies, which made it difficult to make definite conclusions about the role of vitamin D on complications after joint replacement. They concluded that there is insufficient literature to conclusively establish an association between vitamin D and adverse outcomes, including infection and stiffness. Nevertheless, they said that due to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the plausible association with poor outcomes, routine preoperative screening of vitamin D levels should be considered in patients undergoing lower extremity total joint arthroplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for prevalence in community-dwelling people, one &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1163737/full"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found nearly 20% of noninstitutional middle-aged and older adults in the United States were vitamin D deficient, which was correlated to increased mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study, published in &lt;a href="https://eor.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eor/7/5/EOR-21-0136.xml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EFORT Open Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May 2022, found only three studies that have reported on the perioperative administration of vitamin D and its effect on a measured outcome following total knee replacement surgery. In one randomized controlled trial, compared with the administration of placebo, the administration of a multivitamin significantly modulated the postoperative response, as indicated by a reduction in the measure of inflammation. But the authors were unable to attribute that finding directly to vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended further adequately powered randomized controlled trials using vitamin D supplementation and patient-reported outcome measures to assess if preoperative vitamin D insufficiency is a modifiable risk factor to improve outcomes following total hip and total knee replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more recent literature review and meta-analysis of 10 studies, published in &lt;a href="https://hub.jbjs.org/reader.php?rsuite_id=fa543831-c73d-4565-94ee-092a83ae82d8&amp;amp;source=JBJS_Reviews/12/4/e23.00150&amp;amp;topics=kn+bs#info"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, found that in four of the studies, vitamin D deficiency resulted in poorer outcomes, including increased risk for revision surgery, joint infection, and postoperative stiffness. The authors found that outcomes improved with vitamin D supplementation in six of the studies and that there was a significant increase in the length of hospital stays for patients with vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimizing Patient Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements says &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#en55"&gt;screening for vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt; is becoming more common in routine laboratory bloodwork ordered by primary care physicians. The USPSTF &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2678622"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 that evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin De deficiency in asymptomatic adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients may not follow their physician’s recommendation to take a vitamin D supplement if their levels are low. Lajam said when faced with having a hip or knee replacement surgery, patients who have ignored or procrastinated managing their health conditions may be motivated to take steps to improve their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We tell patients that if they don’t tune things up, they could have a disastrous problem. And then their ears prick up and they think, ‘I’d better do this,’” she said. “Maybe there is some lasting effect of the intervention we do as surgeons to get people ready for surgery. If we can encourage folks to get vitamin D levels under control, maybe that will stick with them afterward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lajam was senior author of a 2023 study that assessed improvement in preoperative levels of A1c in patients with diabetes following total joint arthroplasty. The &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00402-023-04765-6"&gt;retrospective analysis&lt;/a&gt; found patients with higher preoperative A1c were more likely to have clinically meaningful decreases in A1c postoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said their findings show that multifactorial and personalized intervention can improve glycemic control and complications from diabetes. They concluded their results, whether due to focused optimization, improved postoperative mobility, or a combination of these factors, provide hope that undergoing total joint replacement can have a positive impact on overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piuzzi’s advice for physicians is that whoever sees a patient first, whether it is a primary care physician or an orthopedic surgeon, take the time for comprehensive optimization of patient care, which involves managing their diabetes, obesity, nutrition, and vitamin D status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How can we improve health overall so that if the patient ends up reaching the point where they need a joint replacement, we already can make use of those several years or months of optimization?” he said. By optimizing care, we can “expect to have better outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piuzzi is a paid consultant or speaker for Stryker Corporation.

It’s still not entirely clear, but the drug appears to &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/03/metformin-weight-diabetes.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mimic the hunger-fighting effects;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;mimic the hunger-fighting effects&lt;/a&gt; of vigorous exercise, according to a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-01014-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study published last year;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, experts don’t consider metformin a substitute for medications like Wegovy, which are FDA-approved for weight loss. “Sometimes people do lose weight on [metformin], and most people don’t gain weight on it, but we don’t typically use it as a weight loss medication because there just isn’t great data on it,” says Thangudu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Metformin has relatively mild side effects. At higher doses in particular, it can cause an upset stomach, nausea and diarrhea. However, most people tolerate it well, especially by going to a lower dose and building back up, says Thangudu. Plus, it shouldn’t be taken by those with liver or kidney disease, heart failure or type 1 diabetes, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/metformin-oral-route/description/drg-20067074#drug-before-using" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-are-telehealth-providers-prescribing-metformin-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are telehealth providers prescribing metformin for weight loss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite its modest weight loss effects, Hims &amp;amp; Hers offers metformin for exactly that purpose. A bit of weight loss is not an uncommon side effect of the medication, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.howard.edu/oluwaranti-akiyode" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ranti Akiyode;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Ranti Akiyode&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pharmacy practice at Howard University College of Pharmacy, tells Yahoo Life. But it wouldn’t usually be a go-to treatment for weight loss, she says. For that reason, “the big concern is the expectations that [prescribers like Hims &amp;amp; Hers] are setting up for patients,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://centerforweightandwellness.com/about/meet-our-team/scott-kahan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Scott Kahan;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Scott Kahan&lt;/a&gt;, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness, tells Yahoo Life. He doesn’t think that a drug like metformin can meet patients’ expectations for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Hims &amp;amp; Hers may not be expecting metformin to fulfill that promise on its own either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Metformin is just one of the drugs included in Hims &amp;amp; Hers’s “&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss/oral-weight-loss-medication-kits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medication Kit 1;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Medication Kit 1&lt;/a&gt;.” In addition to metformin, the kit contains addiction medications (to “reduce cravings and appetite”), a seizure medication that suppresses appetite and vitamin B12 (“for balance”). It’s worth noting that Hers says a licensed medical provider reviews a patient’s health history and treatment plan before sending the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the medications in the kit may cause people to eat less, which may, in turn, lead to minor weight loss, experts say. The drugs also aren’t contraindicated — meaning they aren’t dangerous when taken together — according to Akiyode. But it’s not a medication potpourri that she’s familiar with using for weight loss. And Kahan worries that “this cocktail of stuff” won’t help people lose much weight and may even cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-decide-if-metformin-is-right-for-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to decide if metformin is right for you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though doctors don’t consider it a first-line treatment for weight loss, an upside of metformin is that it’s much&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cheaper than drugs such as Wegovy or Ozempic. A month’s supply of generic oral metformin without insurance costs between $10 and $30, according to &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.goodrx.com/metformin/how-much-is-metformin-without-insurance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoodRx;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:17;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt;. At nearly $1,000 without insurance, a month’s supply of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.goodrx.com/ozempic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Ozempic &lt;/a&gt;can cost up to 10 times more than metformin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite research showing only modest benefits from metformin, many Hims &amp;amp; Hers customers say on Reddit forums that they’ve had success with the drug (though, in most cases, it was prescribed along with other medications in their Medication Kit 1). After a month on the cocktail, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HersWeightloss/comments/1d2tau9/kit_1_month_1_review/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one user said;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;one user said&lt;/a&gt; they were down almost 9 pounds. A commenter in the same thread said they were down to 186 pounds from 245 after using kit 1 for a year — a 27% reduction in body weight. Others sang the praises of their slow and steady progress with the program combined, in many cases, with exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thangudu says that if her patients want to try metformin alone for weight loss and don’t have any health conditions, such as kidney disease, that could make the medication harmful, she will prescribe it. However, Kahan says that his patients who lose significant amounts of weight on metformin alone are “outliers.” And while he’ll allow that there may be instances when the cocktail of medications included in Hims &amp;amp; Hers’s Kit 1 are appropriate, he finds the drug combination in Kit 1 “very concerning” and thinks prescribing it is “bordering on malpractice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, if you’re considering taking metformin, experts agree that you should consult with a health care provider to be sure that it’s safe for you to take and that it’s the right medication for your goals. Second, be aware that you may have diarrhea and nausea when you start metformin. Taking it with a meal, especially later in the day, may help stem these effects, which are also milder at lower doses or when using an extended-release form of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kahan says that if his patients are going to lose weight on metformin, they will know fairly quickly. So, if it’s been three months since you started your first dose or one month at a high dose and you’re not losing any weight, it might be time to try something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 12:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPd2ZDRHVMRUJUR1lVeFBFUjFzVUFuSjZUS3BRZlNVbjAtbjdBYWNQc0VkbFFaMUVvRHRtQkRLQ1pjdnlBTmxnOXhpdmNQRUJoamlxVjVlUVdyVnZJRGtEdGdNc2tUR1JXeUVhWGktQ3Q4eUFyZHpyeVhzdURiek51eGpmdXNhcHlKaUgwbDRyX3lhZ1dQSWRwNnNLQi1HdjZDNi1vYVZDTlFyNHRXYzVUMjVnckxMX2h3X0lVU09UMTZRSW8</guid></item><item><title>Mystery illness worries doctors after 50 people die in Congo within hours of symptoms - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNSlZaUjZQRXRxS3B5VlRkb3BpVVY1WXNRRGlhb2Y3UkpqRFdxQTJTd2p5VnAzUzIzSzFzVWt3LW9BbmtEdUtNRWVHN2k3T2pkMFNkYThUTUU4eTk4NDVSRUlDVlBBZU5wZ01NOUM5MlJJd0dnVzBoeFpwTEEyWlprZ0hxY1NlMXdUSWhTSnBaRXd2SGFOeTFucmMwcWZWZDVYb2RYZlVMRHFEWC1URFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 lkPksW sc-jbiisr-1 hiukpJ" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cFynzd" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-0 eFDpwi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 jkkqcL"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dDFcwe"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 kqOtlp"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 bjQKsM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 hWxisF sc-hez36s-16 gBaKpR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 ifXxYf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 jlvSeZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 ghJHgZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 bhFQeV"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 gMxIQB"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

claim to have found a cellular 'master switch' which can reverse the process of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This protein, called AP2A1, could be the key to future treatments that will turn back the body's biological clock and undo the damage caused by old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As our bodies get older, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13646707/anti-ageing-elixir-mice-humans.html"&gt;we build up a growing number of old or 'senescent' cells&lt;/a&gt; which stop dividing and functioning as they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These 'zombie cells' don't die but rather continue to grow and pump out inflammatory chemicals which contribute to age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers found that they could turn senescent cells back into young, healthy cells simply by reducing the amount of the protein AP2A1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In theory, that means scientists could remove the cause of age-related diseases like &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-9027b8e0-f36a-11ef-84e4-b1da67e384e8"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; or arthritis by reversing the process of senescence at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say they have discovered a cellular 'master switch' which can reverse the body's natural ageing process (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body's ageing process is incredibly complex and there is no single factor responsible for why we get old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, cell senescence is one process which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14266421/Anti-ageing-breakthrough-benjamin-button-vaccine-body-clock-dementia.html"&gt;appears to play a significant role in bringing on the negative consequences&lt;/a&gt; of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Richard Faragher, an expert on cell ageing from the University of Brighton who was not involved in the study, says: 'Normal cells monitor the number of times they have been called on to divide as a cancer prevention mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, after a variable number of divisions, these cells become senescent which means they activate pathways to ensure they will not divide again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senescent cells also 'radically change the way in which they behave' and start to produce inflammatory molecules and enzymes which degrade the surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They essentially become poisonous to the body,' says Professor Faragher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This process causes many changes in the cell but one of the most obvious is that the cells grow until they become up to six times the size of a young cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As they grow, senescent cells build up thick, scaffold-like 'stress fibres' which stretch across the cell and give it additional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Although it might sound like something from the science-fiction film The Substance (pictured), researchers say this master switch could be used to make treatments that 'cure' ageing by bringing cells back to a youthful state &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Dr Pirawan Chantachotikul at the University of Osaka says: 'We still don’t understand how these senescent cells can maintain their huge size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One intriguing clue is that stress fibres are much thicker in senescent cells than in young cells, suggesting that proteins within these fibres help support their size.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since AP2A1 is involved in the processes which maintain stress fibres, Dr Chantachotikul and her colleagues decided to investigate whether it also had a connection to cell ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a process called RNA interference, the researchers created specially engineered pieces of genetic material to inhibit parts of the DNA in human skin cells called fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Essentially, this process turned down the systems which would naturally produce AP2A1 - leading to lower levels building up in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the amount of AP2A1 was reduced, the cells returned to their normal size, started to divide again, and showed signs of youthfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, when the researchers increased the amount of AP2A1 the cells started to become bigger and grew thicker stress fibres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior study author Dr Shinji Deguchi at the University of Osaka described the results as 'very intriguing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers examined cells from human skin called fibroblasts (illustrated). When the levels of the protein AP2A1 were reduced, the cells left their old or 'senescent' state and began to divide again &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers found that senescent cells had larger stress fibres (shown in green) which helped them grow to abnormal sizes. Since AP2A1 helps these stress fibres to grow, it also plays a key role in cell senescence &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Suppressing AP2A1 in older cells reversed senescence and promoted cellular rejuvenation, while AP2A1 overexpression in young cells advanced senescence,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Likewise, in cells that had been artificially aged using UV light or drug treatments, the researchers found higher levels of AP2A1 than they would expect for cells of that age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those results were also replicated in epithelial cells which line the surface or organs in various parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests that AP2A1 might be a universal part of the ageing process, no matter how ageing occurs or where in the body it happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings raise the fascinating possibility of using treatments which control AP2A1 as a 'cure' for ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although senescent cells are not the sole cause of age-related illness, they play a significant role in causing some of the worst effects of old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Faragher explains: 'The senescent cells are behaving badly because they are signalling to the immune system to come and remove them, but your immune system is also made of cells and its ability to get rid of them declines over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The bad things these cells do then cause the problems which we perceive as ageing including everything from wrinkles to vascular calcification' – a buildup of calcium in blood vessel walls that can lead to heart disease and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Office for National Statistics predicts the life expectancy of men born in 2070 in the UK will reach the age of 85 on average, while women will be nearly 88 when they die. However, researchers hope that this could be extended further with a series of new anti-ageing drugs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Faragher says that learning how to remove senescent cells from our bodies could 'transform health in later life' by removing the cause of many age-related conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their paper, published in the journal Cellular Signalling, the researchers write: 'Given its significant role in modulating senescence progression and rejuvenation, our findings suggest that AP2A1 may serve as a novel senescence marker and a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, scientists caution that a 'cure' for ageing is still likely to be a long way off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reversing senescence is not without risks because many cells become senescent to avoid turning into cancer cells,' says Professor Faragher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Likewise, Dr Lazaros Foukas, a scientist researching ageing at University College London who was not involved in the study, told MailOnline: 'There are no sufficient data to supporting a potential therapeutic effect of interventions targeting AP2A1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is an ex vivo [outside a living creature] study and there is no animal model data to support a beneficial effect of targeting AP2A1 on organismal ageing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Dr Foukas points out that this study only looks at how cell senescence affects the structure, or 'morphology', of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He maintains that the more important factor for ageing is a process called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which this study doesn't examine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'SASP is the key feature linking cell senescence with ageing pathologies and it refers to the secretion of a large set of proinflammatory factors secreted by senescent cells and causing chronic inflammation which is associated with the diseases of ageing,' says Dr Foukas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-74749dd0-f369-11ef-84e4-b1da67e384e8"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-c64580a0-7613-11e8-90f4-6b6e3240d80b" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5874149/HOW-SCIENTISTS-USE-TELOMERASE-REVERSE-PROCESS-AGEING.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists decoded an enzyme thought to halt ageing in plants, animals and humans as part of a recent breakthrough study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unravelling the structure of the complex enzyme, called telomerase, could lead to drugs that slow or block the ageing process, along with new treatments for cancer, researchers reported in the journal Nature in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elated scientists announced the completion of a 20-year quest to map the enzyme thought to forestall ageing by repairing the tips of chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It has been a long time coming,' lead investigator Kathleen Collins, a molecular biologist at the University of California in Berkeley, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings provide a structural framework for understanding human telomerase disease mutations, and represent an important step towards telomerase-related clinical therapeutics.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Part protein and part RNA (genetic material that relays instructions for building proteins) telomerase acts on microscopic sheaths, known as telomeres, that cover the tips of the chromosomes found inside all cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, each cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, including one pair of sex chromosomes - the 'X' and 'Y' - that differ between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Australian-American biologist Elizabeth Blackburn, who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering telomeres and their protective function in the 1970s, likened them to the tiny plastic caps that keep shoelaces from fraying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, however, shoelace tips and telomeres do break down: every time a cell divides the telomeres get worn a little bit more, until the cell stops dividing and dies. This, biologists agree, is probably central to the natural ageing process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 11:38:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPLVRZcnRiSkxzQjJJNFBRRGt3OXpaQ0VSQnM3dGJFR1BmdXZuM2MxMXdaQmdoUERBZzFXMWxWOEh0cV9PSW1MSE1DaUdDRWNVVkNnMl9FZld6RkRZWkNkdlJtdVZRMWNleFV2S0kxWFFBR1pDQzgxdzRNdnFxOTdvc2N3Vklldy0wMDI1eHFmY1VrWEQ2ZkQxMUxRZG5BdGJXd0JQRFVuV0TSAa4BQVVfeXFMUEh2RnJGbDB1bjJOdVA1bm0zZndKSTN1RllYakxJS2ZiSEdVU0hZTWhjQjc3OUhJTGpiYlphWGxSNk5KQzV4eGNweDJQbWZDVGVkLUpnRTE4WHJ4YkZrUGF3Q0RCQWo5d3d6RTQ3Y2ducmVYanBtanRnMVY1dlc0SnhCQjNsbWNRemJFMUxOS0hmSnZMaFhHd1VjampFSEdXWF9xdGU5X3Jpb2dNQlVR</guid></item><item><title>What is being built at the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center in Tosa?

(They’re commonly caused by a version of the virus called herpes simplex virus type 1, or HSV-1, which is different from the version that typically causes genital herpes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For many, the lesions are “unsightly and painful,” said Dr. Christine Johnston, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Washington School of Medicine. They’re also common, she added: Roughly half of people in the United States have HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s how to treat cold sores, and whether you can prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-4bec567b"&gt;What causes cold sores?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The herpes virus is “very contagious,” said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. You can pick it up through close contact with someone who is infected, such as through kissing or sharing food or drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And it’s not always easy to tell whether someone is contagious, Dr. Blumberg said. People can transmit oral herpes without a visible cold sore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you do become infected, you might not develop a cold sore right away or even at all, Dr. Blumberg added. It could take years before you have an outbreak, Dr. Johnston said, or maybe you never get one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
