But last month, looking for more convenience, she made the switch to disposable vapes - a decision that would nearly end her life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While refillable vapes and disposable vapes may appear similar, there is a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With refillable vapes, e-liquids tend to be more regulated and sold by specialty shops or online, while the disposable equivalents often contain unlisted or unknown chemicals; some use synthetic nicotine or high concentrations of sweeteners, artificial flavors, or heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the heating elements in refillable vapes are usually made of stainless steel or ceramic coils, while the disposable offerings often use cheaper metals (nickel, chromium, tin, lead), which can leach into the vapor being inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After finishing three disposable vapes (one vape can be equivalent to hundreds of puffs or even multiple packs of cigarettes, depending on the device) Shackleford said she saw her health quickly deteriorate and began experiencing what she initially thought was a mild cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zoe Shackleford first started smoking cigarettes at 18 but after around four years, switched to e-cigarettes in the belief they would be a 'healthier' alternative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought it was from swimming,' she said. 'I had a sore throat. I didn't think much of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within 48 hours, she found herself struggling to breathe, even during basic activities like changing clothes or using the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shackleford then became completely breathless while speaking, and realized something was seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On August 17, she was rushed to the hospital, where doctors found her airways were functioning at just 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was first admitted to the hospital, I had only 50 percent of my airway open. It was completely closing off,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Doctors] said if I hadn't come that night, I probably wouldn't have made it to the hospital.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the hospital, Shackleford was tested for pneumonia, bronchitis, and sepsis - but all results came back negative. Her condition worsened despite initial treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They didn't know how to treat me. Everything they were trying wasn't working, so they kept going with the breathing treatments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was kept in the hospital for nine days, receiving supplemental oxygen to help her breathe, steroids to open her airways, and antibiotics to combat any possible infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon discharge, she was referred to a lung specialist for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following a detailed consultation, the specialist diagnosed her with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) - a rare inflammatory lung condition triggered by an immune response to inhaled substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On August 17, she went to the hospital where doctors reportedly said her airways were at 50 percent capacity and she could have died if she hadn't sought urgent medical attention &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said that I have something called hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He said he hasn't seen this in two years,' Shackleford recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The vape that I was using had a chemical that was reacting negatively with my lungs - basically closing off my airway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HP is caused by inhaling substances like mold, bird droppings, or chemical vapors, and it leads to severe inflammation in the tiny air sacs and airways of the lungs. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to permanent lung scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While rare - affecting just one to three people per 100,000 annually - HP is well-documented in people exposed to environmental irritants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is sometimes referred to as 'farmer's lung' because it plagues one percent of farmers, who are repeatedly exposed to mold grown on hay, straw and grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been dubbed 'bird fancier's lung' because it can be caused by breathing in particles from feathers or bird droppings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many other substances can trigger similar disease patterns. In many cases it can be very difficult to find the exact cause. The symptoms include cough, shortness of breath and sometimes fever and joint pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Shackleford's case, doctors traced the cause back to a chemical used in her disposable vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now home and recovering, Shackleford is on asthma medication once a day and uses an inhaler twice daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm feeling a lot better, I'm not losing my breath as much,' she said. 'When I first came out of the hospital, even taking a shower exhausted me. I have trouble catching my breath sometimes but it's not as bad.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since quit vaping and smoking altogether, a decision she admits hasn't been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a little bit of a challenge because I do miss it, but I think I miss the motion more,' she said. 'I feel like I snack more now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she's clear that no craving is worth risking her life again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you can get to a point of stopping, I would - that was one of the scariest experiences of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Honestly, it's not worth it. You only get one life. Something so simple as stopping vaping can help save it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stopping her vaping habit has also saved Shackleford money, as she would go through a $25 disposable vape every 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zoe at first dismissed her symptoms as catching a sore throat from swimming late at night - however soon she couldn't speak without losing her breath and rushed to the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;And study published in June by University of California that tested seven flavored e-cigarettes from three of the most popular brands (ELF Bar, Flum Pebble and Esco) found the disposable vapes release more cancer-causing toxic metals than cigarettes. The above graphic shows the heavy metals in different parts of the tested disposable vapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes and e-cigarettes have long been marketed as a safer alternative to tobacco and a tool for quitting smoking - and in many cases, they may carry fewer immediate toxins than cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recent studies are raising alarm bells, particularly around disposable vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 University of California study analyzed seven popular flavored disposable vapes - including ELF Bar, Flum Pebble, and Esco - and found they released more toxic heavy metals than cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the vapes tested released more lead in a single day than 20 packs of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These metals - including lead, nickel, and chromium - come from the heating coils inside the devices, which leach into the liquid and are inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have been linked to serious health risks including cancer, asthma, and lung scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite concerns about the health consequences, vaping continues to grow in popularity, especially among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, 3.5 percent of US middle schoolers and 7.8 percent of high schoolers reported vaping in the past 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That translates to approximately 410,000 middle school and 1.21 million high school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, adult use of e-cigarettes increased from 4.5 percent in 2019 to 6.5 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shackleford's message to others is simple: don't assume vaping is harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was surprised it was the vaping because you hear stories of everybody else — until it actually happens to you,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was one of the scariest experiences of my life. It's not worth it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 13:16:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeGUwcTNwMktUM1VSWUJKeTV5V2tkbDhzS053eUVTUHNPSEFHYk1pa3RPbVJOYmpnN2tLV2x5U01xaFBnMGo4akszdDdpZzVSUDE1b0hQcGJIakZlcnRyb1hLWmlOeF9sNVdrTWJ3TmczUVZKWVMxWWtMbjJ0Sjdfd0Z3czRUVG1NejlkaFVsam5MNnJjSnlVTFVmcWpzdV9vOVF4dzFLSERhcGl20gGyAUFVX3lxTE9TZ3FWYm5XLVJSTG1zZkJ2Q1BMRzhLT2s1b3RjMEY1dVRNMExnMUVEN043QjhnLVNadDU2NVFSTW9vN2o2cmhZREUtMV9Pc3Ewcm1uS1g1aXlZRk55UzUxMnE0VUFCai11dXZWd1hQZVdVSkxvM3JqdUUzRWFoZjY0eTVoTmJUUXI0VTZlVUhVanotbWEwemxlUnBld0I1ZmJxNUFJRjBOVF9CSEVhNmdWaUE</guid></item><item><title>一个6岁的孩子双眼交叉。医生发现了一种快速生长的脑肿瘤。- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brain-cancer-tumor-diagnosis-florida-holtz-childrens-hospital-miami-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imani Dell seemed like a happy, healthy 6-year-old. She loved bedtime stories and Chuck E. Cheese. She was energetic and cheerful whether she was at school or home with her parents. In May 2024, she was two weeks away from graduating first grade, and was looking forward to a summer of spending time at the playground in her north Miami neighborhood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, her aunt noticed her eyes were crossed. Imani's mother, Johnesha Brown, thought that it might be because she spent too much time on a tablet. She tried to take Imani to their pediatrician, but found her insurance was expired. When the mother and daughter got home, Imani said she was seeing double. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was scared and so worried, like, now something serious was going on with her," Brown said. She filled out the application to renew her insurance, then called the company. They said it would take 30 days to review the paperwork. "I said 'I can't wait 30 days. My child needs to be seen right now.' And the lady who I spoke to ... She told me to take her to the hospital." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown thought her daughter would just need an eye exam, but when Imani was seen at the University of Miami Health System's emergency room, a nurse said she would need a CT scan to ensure there was nothing wrong in her brain. The test confirmed Brown's worst fears: There was a golf-ball sized tumor in her daughter's brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He came in with his head down, and he said 'Your daughter has a large mass in her head.' Everything just went down from there,'" Brown recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"I was just praying the entire time"    &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani was transferred to the Holtz Children's Hospital, where she underwent brain surgery. Dr. Heather McCrea, the hospital's director of pediatric neurosurgery, said she had three goals with the procedure: to treat fluid build-up in Imani's brain that was caused by the tumor, to remove the mass and to study it to determine what other treatment Imani would need. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation was successful on all three fronts, McCrea said. Doctors determined the mass was a fast-growing tumor called a medulloblastoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medulloblastomas are tumors that largely occur in children and infants, said Dr. David Harter, the director of the division of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone Health. There are multiple subtypes of this kind of tumor, each with its own "genetic signatures" like "different mutations or developmental pathways," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;
    
                                    
      &lt;span class="img embed__content"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/24/f9c29b32-b8c0-41dd-8d75-2e62e3664c23/thumbnail/620x465/672a2c395e40ed6807593181aab4762e/img-6595.jpg#" alt="img-6595.jpg " class=" lazyload" srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/24/f9c29b32-b8c0-41dd-8d75-2e62e3664c23/thumbnail/620x465/672a2c395e40ed6807593181aab4762e/img-6595.jpg 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/24/f9c29b32-b8c0-41dd-8d75-2e62e3664c23/thumbnail/1240x930/ad82d46e3ce4415e1d72822acb8c62a5/img-6595.jpg 2x" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      
          &lt;figcaption class="embed__caption-container"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each subtype has its own symptoms and prognosis, though most forms of medulloblastoma manifest with symptoms like vomiting, headaches or crossed eyes. Medulloblastomas can also commonly cause hydrocephalus, or fluid build-up in the brain. That had caused the fluid McCrea had needed to remove from Imani's brain. The tumor's prognosis also depends on its subtype, Harter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Imani's tumor was removed, molecular classification was used to determine its subtype. Dr. Bradley Gampel, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist who treated Imani, said her tumor was "Group 4 medulloblastoma with intermediate risk." That meant she would need both chemotherapy and radiation. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classifying tumor subtypes helps doctors ensure patients are receiving proper treatment, Gampel and Harter both said. When treating pediatric patients, it's important to think of how treatment can impact a child's future, Harter said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not just enough to win the war over the tumor," Harter said. "We have to also consider the long-term effects of any therapies that we're going to give." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani underwent 30 rounds of radiation. The process was hard on her, Brown said: She had to be sedated for the treatment, so she was always sleepy afterward. She had a burn on her head from receiving the therapy. She struggled to eat and lost weight. She had little energy and didn't want to play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just praying the entire time, hoping that everything would go well and be okay," Brown said. "And I was thinking about 'How long will my daughter be in treatment? How will she feel when she loses all her hair? She's young, she won't really understand what's going on. How will my daughter feel knowing she's going through all this?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the radiation was complete, Imani had a four-week break from treatment. Then, she received nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of about a year. This process was easier, Brown said, though Imani did lose her hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, Imani was homeschooled, with the mother and daughter spending an hour a day going over a subject like history or math. Imani "didn't like" the homeschooling, Brown said, but it was a relief to see her energy levels begin to return.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Everything just is perfect" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani finished treatment during the first week of August 2025, Brown said. To celebrate, the family went to the Epic Universe theme park. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-September, Imani returned to school for second grade. While she was nervous about going back to the classroom, Brown said she expected her daughter will like being with her friends and other kids much more than the homeschooling she had last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imani will regularly undergo scans to ensure her cancer isn't returning, McCrea said. Those scans will become more spread out as long as the cancer shows no signs of recurrence. Right now, Imani's scans are "looking good," McCrea said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown said things have been "amazing, amazing, amazing" since Imani finished treatment. Her renewed insurance covered the entire treatment process. Her daughter has been featured in two different research studies. Most importantly, Imani is starting to act like her old self. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My child really finished treatment, and she's going back to being her normal self again," Brown said. "I'm happy. I'm very excited. Everything just is perfect to me."&lt;/p&gt;

That means it’s not only your fatty deposits that’ll take a significant hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there is a more proven and natural way to cut weight – and that’s to maximise your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p purpleid="02f3949a-cde3-4aec-91ac-699d93ff0fab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nightmare obesity scenario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence shows insufficient sleep doesn’t simply leave you wrestling with a cranky mood – it contributes to weight gain and heightens the risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a 2022 study by the Mayo Clinic, which revealed subjects who had their sleep restricted in the laboratory endured a 9 per cent increase in abdominal fat and an 11 per cent increase in visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat is the belly fat buried deep within your abdominal cavity. It protects your organs, but having too much leads to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further study into sleep and weight found women who slept for five hours per night were 32 per cent more likely to experience major weight gain (defined as 33lb or more) and 15 per cent more likely to become obese, over the course of the 16-year study, compared to women who slept for seven hours or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is this, and where do hormones come into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Optimise sleep, optimise hunger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/CYP_PBP_JB_-21-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The antics of cyclists, such as here at the Paris-Brest-Paris audax, often actively discourage a good night's sleep. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a clear relationship between sleep and body mass,” says sleep expert Dr Sarah Gilchrist, whose book &lt;em&gt;The Essential Guide to Women’s Sleep&lt;/em&gt; hits the shelves later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the major reasons why is that we make poor food choices, and a big driver of that is your hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take leptin, which is known as our ‘energy-expenditure hormone’,” Gilchrist adds. “It regulates appetite and is influenced by sleep. Reduced sleep means lower leptin levels and, in turn, greater hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then there’s ghrelin. This is called the ‘hunger hormone’ because it increases the drive to eat. Ghrelin levels increase through lack of sleep, making us feel hungrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you sleep poorly, you’ll have lower leptin and higher ghrelin levels, which will likely increase appetite and possibly explain the increased BMI [body mass index] observed with short sleep duration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Research&lt;/em&gt;, showed that just one night’s broken sleep raises ghrelin levels significantly, explaining why you might have hunger cravings when you’re tired. They also showed that two nights or more of poor sleep reduces leptin levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, your appetite hormones (and mind) are scrambled through lack of sleep. That’s not great news for your weight and health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all – apologies, but we have further bad hormonal news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep also lowers levels of testosterone,” says Gilchrist. “There’s clear evidence that this lowers muscle mass and increases fat mass. That’s bad enough, but that then leads to a further decrease in testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your body mass continues to increase, this can lead to a potential sleep disorder (sleep apnoea), which further reduces sleep quality and quantity, and the cycle continues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insufficient sleep decreases levels of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH is predominantly released during deep sleep – aka slow wave sleep – but if this is low, so is HGH secretion, which isn’t great for your weight because HGH increases muscle mass and reduces fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also evidence that poor sleep impacts other metabolic and endocrine processes. For instance, a decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and raised evening concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the psychological impact, too. We all know anecdotally that lack of sleep results in demotivation to undertake any activity that requires a hint of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t fully understood why this is, but research suggests it’s down to your mind determining whether it has the resources needed to complete the task, deciding whether those resources are available or accessible, and whether those resources need to be used or conserved for tasks of higher priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, sleep deprivation alters the perception of this resource distribution and makes things feel tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fatigue perception is highlighted further by a 1995 study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, where researchers deprived subjects of sleep for 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the deprivation, the participants completed a series of physical tasks and, although they achieved the same level of physical result, the participants perceived that the workload had increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Boost sleep, lose weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/GettyImages-532655194-2.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941106"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Pro teams have put more emphasis on sleep in recent years. &lt;span&gt;Tim de Waele/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bleak, sleep-deprived picture, but one that can be brightened. Which is what we’ll do now by rebooting your sleep and hormonal levels in an effort to lose a few pounds and retain your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Well, Gilchrist suggests that a cool, calm sleep environment, with a comfortable bed and the right temperature (around 18 to 20°C), will help, as will a sleep routine that’s as regular and consistent as it can be in your individual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who struggle with sleep will no doubt have tried this lore of good sleep. If you have and it didn’t work, you must listen to Nick Littlehales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlehales is a sleep expert who shot to prominence around 20 years ago after working with numerous sports teams, including Real Madrid and Manchester United in football and Team Sky in cycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the best recovery tool we possess but, said Littlehales, these multi-million outfits were neglecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the world’s finest sportspeople were sleeping on bespoke mattresses and toppers with portable air-conditioning units to keep the likes of Sir Bradley Wiggins at optimum sleep temperature when pursuing Tour de France glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlehales is a proponent of breaking sleep down into several 90-minute cycles rather than seeing it as one big chunk because, he says, the end of a sleep cycle is when the body and brain find waking easiest. Awaken mid-cycle and you’ve undone much of your good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ideal is individual but you’re looking at four or five 90-minute cycles, but key is that you plan to awake at the end of the cycle because you’ll feel fresher,” Littlehales says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, say your wake time is 6.30am, aim to sleep by 11pm. That’s seven and a half hours, or five cycles. You can then adjust your sleep time if needed. If you have to be up early and can’t go to bed earlier, aim to sleep at 11pm and awake at 5am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That’s six hours, or four cycles. Conversely, if you feel you need more sleep, grab yourself an extra cycle by going to sleep at 9.30pm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of napping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/GettyImages-1140539003.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941108"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Naps are a great way to catch up on missed sleep cycles. &lt;span&gt;Justin Paget/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to Littlehales’ R90 technique is to stop thinking of sleep in a monophasic way, he says. That means your sleep must come in one block. Instead, think of it as polyphasic – more than one – which is where napping comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A 30-minute nap is the ideal if you haven’t ticked off your optimum number of cycles,” says Littlehales. “The good thing is you don’t have to fall asleep; simply switching off your mind, by sitting down and simply chilling, helps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can squeeze in a 30-minute mental shutdown, aim to do it between 1pm and 3pm. That’s because of our natural mid-afternoon slump, which contrary to popular belief doesn’t derive from a big lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s down to our body temperature, which follows a distinct rhythm where it peaks in the early evening and hits a trough about two to three hours before waking up in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s also a small dip between the hours of 1pm and 3pm, which is called the post-prandial dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A drop in body temperature will cause feelings of sleepiness,” says Littlehales, “so if you have had a bad or shortened night sleep then feelings of sleepiness during this period will be intensified in the majority of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even enjoy a ‘nappuccino’, whereby you consume a caffeinated product before you nap, so you feel even more alert after the 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is about making you more involved in ‘sleeping’ – you’re almost seeing it as a performance criteria like eating healthily and exercising – rather than simply waiting for it to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Littlehales is a keen proponent of what he calls MRMs, or micro reset moments, where like napping, you do very little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My personal favourite is simply looking out of the window for a couple of minutes every hour or so,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just switch off and unwind. That’s so important to sleeping well and balancing out your hormones. Ultimately, the key is to be active regarding your sleep but not to put pressure on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I remember when I worked with world-class cyclists years ago, we encouraged them to wear nasal strips to nose breathe at night and ideally help them sleep more proficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you don’t need the extra tools as most of them are really not proven to work. These few simple steps and redefining how you see sleep will help you kip better and help you lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BikeRadar</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5QWGJES1o2NFhMZS1nSE9Yc1l4d0xLbkJUajAtT3V3TlNVc0ZHRnU1UFNBM3dvNVk3STVTSG5HWklrUE5iMmQzWnlqTGpIWWRDNHl1M2piMkxtN0R6RGN6cHZIRVIxQ1V5MVcwbWZnM1U</guid></item><item><title>如何面向未来保护膝盖- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250926-how-to-futureproof-your-knees</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kySSTS"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"As you get stronger, you can certainly add weight, by doing some of these exercises wearing weighted vests, or holding weights if you have access to them, but that also depends on your age and your strength level," he says. "As we get older, body weight alone tends to be best. I also tell patients to monitor worsening pain. Muscle soreness is normal, but worsening pain in the joints is not good, as that indicates something going on inside the knee that needs to be seen by a doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Overall, taking the time to do knee strengthening exercises serves as a valuable investment in your long-term health. We might take our knees for granted, but they let us walk, skip, jump and run, until they fail.

Fentanyl overdoses, in particular, are expected to fall to a near 10-year low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JGIFXIBNOZD7LMXU5TKTDP3RQE"&gt;But that progress could largely be offset by an increase in cocaine deaths – again, some mixed with opioids – which is projected to kill 399 Cuyahogans by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F6JFDKF3FNEQZM22KVVM4NS46Y"&gt;“This is the problem that we’re living with now,” Gilson said of the moment. “Opiates aren’t going to go away, but if you define an epidemic as a disease that’s occurring at a higher incidence rate in the population than baseline, well, we’ve had two years of decline; so, it’s pretty hard to say, ‘I’m still living in the opioid epidemic.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The shift&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4G3IXJSF6ZANPBE2OJV57LGPTA"&gt;Opioid-related deaths, especially involving fentanyl, have been falling sharply over the last three years. Last year, overdose deaths dropped below 500 for the first time in a decade. &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/12/overdose-deaths-dropped-drastically-in-cuyahoga-county-this-year-officials-cant-explain-why.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;The reason still isn’t clear.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6JOJESHUWVFBDPRJ7TEEY6J63Y"&gt;It could be that the fentanyl supply is shrinking, or that what is circulating on the street is less potent, with smaller amounts showing up in drug mixtures, Gilson said. It could also be intervention strategies and overdose reversal drugs are working to curb deaths. Gilson suspects younger generations have started shying away from the drug, after years of warnings about its lethal effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DGEMS3GN7ZFU7AIASCFGO77GLQ"&gt;Regardless, he worried that the lull was only leaving the door open for something else. Something new. It turns out, it was actually something old – though thankfully less lethal: cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5VZRXSS22ZDUZBLKTEX7EI6HUE"&gt;Gilson recalled the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, which devastated many urban communities and coincided with a major crime wave. The crisis helped fuel the “tough-on-crime” era, leading to harsh sentencing laws and mass incarceration that disproportionately affected Black Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KWL4QG62FVEB7PC6U77US5UC4A"&gt;Back then the drug was killing 100-150 people a year in the county – a number which pales in comparison to the 600-700 who were dying at the peak of the opioid crisis. Now, though, the numbers are ticking upward again, and faster, partly fueled by cocaine-opioid mixtures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NOLQ3RXW5REB3JDQ5ISF7VSZKI"&gt;In August, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/pdfs/mm7432-H.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noting a rise in overdose deaths involving stimulants, like cocaine and methamphetamine, since 2011. Though it primarily attributed the increase to opioid mixtures, it noted that “stimulant-involved deaths without opioid co-involvement have also increased.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2YNUTQXLQNE27LOAWZEFR3NZIM"&gt;The CDC urged expanded access to evidence-based treatment for stimulant use disorder, along with outreach to people “who might be missed by opioid-focused prevention efforts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RBKVTT2275AA7CAPFN3XDDPPNQ"&gt;After seeing the shift locally, Gilson is sounding his own alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SY66ZKG6ZNAGHDIQOEWDQQJLXQ"&gt;“Things are changing, and the demographics of who’s affected by it is changing, too,” Gilson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;New strategies?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IGVVZWY2TBETPOCTHNXB3C7SEI"&gt;In the early phases of the opioid epidemic, particularly with prescription painkillers, white communities bore the brunt of overdose deaths. Even as the crisis evolved and overall numbers leveled out, Gilson’s office continued to record higher rates of fentanyl and opioid fatalities among white residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__image"&gt;&lt;div class="article__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 500w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 800w" sizes="80vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, (max-width: 800px) 80vw, 60vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Overdose deaths" class="hero-image" src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__image-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__mm-image-caption-text"&gt;Overdose data through the first half of the year shows a rise in cocaine-related deaths, especially among Black men.&lt;span class="article__mm-image-credit"&gt;(Courtesy of the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FVVQJ2YFZRHSXBCUUCRHA5O6QQ"&gt;However, the rise in cocaine overdoses is disproportionately affecting the Black community, echoing patterns seen in the 1980s and 1990s. In the first half of this year, overdose deaths among white residents declined compared to 2024, while the share among Black residents rose from 42% to 48%. Black men, in particular, were impacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SAXFSHZCXNBKDFAVB27PU4CISE"&gt;“We’re reverting back to a pre-opioid phase,” Gilson said. “And that means we’re going to see another racial disparity develop like we did before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R5DLTEDDFNEDNCOLVQJXOYSWG4"&gt;That makes directing prevention and treatment outreach specifically to Black communities both more urgent and more challenging, he said. He noted it was harder to reach Black communities with prevention messaging during the opioid epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HVVMD7YLI5AF5O5YIYQLOFA26A"&gt;And that challenge raises a bigger question: whether current prevention and treatment strategies would be adequate, given decades of opioid-focused efforts. Unlike fentanyl, which can be reversed with naloxone, there is no antidote for cocaine overdoses, which often result in sudden heart attacks or strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XZIHM4NDZNFSNJYXI7R3NNT62M"&gt;(Earlier this year, Gilson also flagged the need for &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/04/homicides-and-overdose-deaths-were-down-in-2024-but-suicides-went-up-what-does-this-mean-for-prevention-strategies.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;better prevention strategies to address rising suicide rates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5PF6TLHX5ZANZIDEYO47LPQO5I"&gt;One strategy Gilson said he knows can help save lives is reminding people not to use drugs alone. He reiterated a recent &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2024/09/majority-of-overdose-victims-in-cuyahoga-county-died-alone-according-to-new-case-western-reserve-university-research.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;study by Case Western Reserve University&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found that about 75% of overdose victims over a five-year period were using alone, increasing death rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UZGYSWNXZRFPXEACJZQHQQMFVI"&gt;But what other strategies may be needed to save lives remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RV6IBWLWDFBSJLYA2NSSMBYAJI"&gt;“The winds are changing,” Gilson said. “If we want to really be effective, we need to start pivoting to these stimulants as enemy number one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at AIIMS, Harvard, and Stanford, recently highlighted key early warning signs and common misconceptions in an Instagram video. Early indicators include abdominal weight gain, persistent fatigue, discomfort under the right rib cage, skin and hair changes, and loss of appetite. Recognising these signs at home allows for timely intervention. Dr. Sethi emphasises that lifestyle changes, such as reducing processed sugars, eating whole foods, and exercising regularly, can protect liver health, prevent disease progression, and even reverse fatty liver in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As NAFLD becomes one of the most common liver conditions worldwide, Dr. Sethi’s advice highlights the importance of early detection, myth-busting, and lifestyle modification. By watching for subtle signs like abdominal fat, fatigue, or skin changes, individuals can intervene before minor symptoms escalate into serious health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Ways to check for fatty liver at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to detect early &lt;keyword id="29109136" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Fatty-liver-symptoms-at-home" source="Orion"&gt;fatty liver symptoms at home&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Abdominal weight gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest indicators of fatty liver is weight gain around the midsection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi explains that this often occurs due to insulin resistance, a condition where the body cannot efficiently process sugar. Insulin resistance forces the body to store excess fat, particularly around the abdomen, which is closely linked to liver stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While belly fat is often dismissed as a cosmetic concern, central obesity is actually a metabolic warning sign. The liver plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar and fat metabolism; fat accumulation around the waist may indicate that the liver is struggling to process nutrients efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel constantly tired, even after proper rest, this could signal liver dysfunction. Dr. Sethi emphasizes that persistent fatigue is often overlooked but is an early symptom of NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue at this stage can be a precursor to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe liver condition characterized by inflammation and scarring. Early detection through awareness of chronic fatigue can prevent progression to more serious liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Discomfort below the right rib cage&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is located beneath the right rib cage, and subtle discomfort in this area may indicate liver inflammation or enlargement. Dr. Sethi stresses that people often dismiss this symptom as digestive discomfort or muscle strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurring or persistent pain in the right upper abdomen can signal fatty deposits in the liver or early-stage liver inflammation, making it crucial to seek timely medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skin and hair changes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease often manifests externally. Changes such as acne, hair thinning, or darkened skin folds—especially around the neck or underarms—may indicate insulin resistance and liver stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi highlights that these visible signs are early indicators of metabolic disturbances that can eventually affect liver function. Recognizing them can prompt early lifestyle interventions to prevent further complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nausea and loss of appetite&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea and a sudden loss of appetite can be a result of overworked liver function. When the liver cannot efficiently process nutrients and toxins, it impacts digestion and triggers unexplained nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing these symptoms early—through dietary modifications and lifestyle adjustments—can prevent worsening liver function and the development of more serious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Debunking common fatty liver myths&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Myth 1: Dietary fat causes fatty liver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, healthy fats like those in olive oil, nuts, and avocados support liver health.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health experts say turmeric is the best spice to reduce your risk of cancer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may do this by reducing inflammation, guarding against cell damage and promoting gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric is versatile, working well in oatmeal, baked goods, eggs, curries, lattes and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This year alone, the American Cancer Society predicts that more than 2 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some factors, like age and genetics, are out of your control, there are things you can do to take charge of your risk. “The strongest evidence shows that a healthy lifestyle—including nutritious eating, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866755/best-exercises-for-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol—offers the most effective, research-backed way to reduce cancer risk,” says oncologist&lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/patients/find-a-doctor/tingting-tan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; Tingting Tan, M.D., Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Help Tame Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can increase your risk for many chronic diseases, including cancer. Short-term inflammation—like the redness and swelling that happens when you get a paper cut—is a normal part of our body’s defense system. However, too much inflammation can be a bad thing, especially when it becomes chronic, says &lt;a href="https://pamhartnett.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pam Hartnett, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Short bursts of inflammation are beneficial because they help the body heal from an injury,” she explains. “But when inflammation sticks around for too long, it creates an environment where cancer can grow more easily.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s where turmeric can step in. “By lowering this chronic inflammation, turmeric helps the immune system do its job of spotting and clearing out damaged cells before they turn cancerous,” Hartnett says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Protects Your Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Throughout the day, your body naturally produces unstable compounds, called free radicals. Yet, chronically large numbers of free radicals may lead to cancer by damaging cells and their DNA. Fortunately, eating more antioxidant-rich foods, like turmeric, may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-skin-cancer-risk-11765954" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protect your cells&lt;/a&gt; by keeping free radical damage at bay. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what makes it so powerful, research points to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-turmeric-supplements-8602203" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;compound in turmeric called curcumin&lt;/a&gt;. “Curcumin acts like an antioxidant, proactively protecting cells from DNA damage that can lead to mutations,” says&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/victoria-whittington-8609919" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourdietitianvictoria.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Victoria Whittington, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, curcumin’s antioxidant action may make it harder for cancerous cells to grow. “It acts like a roadblock, making it harder for damaged cells to multiply and form tumors,” explains Hartnett. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Promote Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’re increasingly learning that gut health plays a significant role in almost every aspect of our health, including the odds of developing cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that turmeric’s curcumin may reduce cancer risk by bolstering the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health of your good gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; How so? “A healthier microbiome strengthens the gut lining, improves digestion, lowers inflammation and supports immunity,” says Hartnett. “All of these benefits work together to make the body more resilient against cancer.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As encouraging as this is, most studies to date have been conducted in cells or on animals. So, more research in humans is needed. In the meantime, there are plenty of other good reasons to enjoy turmeric.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This bright yellow spice pairs well with both sweet and savory dishes, so it’s a tasty addition to all kinds of foods and drinks. These tips can get you started. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with a healthy fat: &lt;/strong&gt;Turmeric is fat-soluble, meaning your body needs fat to absorb it, explains Whittington. For maximum benefit, she recommends using &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-recipes-anti-inflammatory-boost-2025-8787388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric in recipes&lt;/a&gt; that contain some fat, like olive or avocado oil, or coconut milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go sweet: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, turmeric can be used in sweet dishes, too! “Try stirring turmeric into oatmeal along with cinnamon and honey for a golden breakfast bowl, or add a teaspoon to banana bread or muffins for a warm, earthy flavor,” says Hartnett.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle it into everyday dishes: &lt;/strong&gt;Turmeric has a subtle, peppery flavor that lends itself well to everything from scrambled eggs to roasted veggies, soups and grain bowls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add color to your favorite grain: &lt;/strong&gt;Next time you cook quinoa or brown rice, add a little turmeric to the cooking liquid. In addition to providing a dose of cancer protection, your grains will take on a beautiful, golden hue. For a golden rice that is both flavorful and cozy,&lt;a href="https://myfoodmychoicenutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Tracy Colin, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, recommends adding turmeric to white rice, with a little garlic and black pepper. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whisk it into drinks: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/281100/golden-milk-frappe/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Golden milk&lt;/a&gt;, made from turmeric, dairy or plant-based milk, black pepper and a touch of honey, is a soothing way to enjoy this powerful spice, says Whittington. “You can also toss a little turmeric into smoothies or teas,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spices have loads of health benefits. But if you’re looking for one to help reduce your risk of cancer, make it turmeric. Turmeric is rich in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-ingredient-to-combine-with-turmeric-11694659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;compound called curcumin&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-for-lower-cancer-risk-11800236" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protects against cancer&lt;/a&gt; by reducing inflammation, guarding against cell damage and supporting a healthy gut. Plus, it’s incredibly versatile. It works beautifully in sweet dishes like oatmeal and baked goods. This bright yellow spice is an equally delicious—and stunning—addition to scrambled eggs, roasted veggies, curries, soups and grains. And it always shines in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258547/turmeric-latte/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;comforting turmeric latte&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, no single food or drink can prevent cancer. “Turmeric isn’t a magic cancer shield, but it’s a solid teammate,” says Colin. Why not add it to your starting lineup?&lt;br&gt;

Dr Anya Topiwala, lead author on the paper, said: “Even light or moderate drinking may increase the risk of dementia, indicating that reducing alcohol consumption across the population could play a significant role in dementia prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went on to say that the common belief that a little bit of alcohol, the odd glass of red, say, might actually be good for the brain – neuroprotective – is almost certainly nonsense. “Genetic evidence offers no support for a protective effect,” she said. “In fact, it suggests the opposite.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. Never mind congratulating yourselves for sticking to the government’s recommended guidelines on booze (14 units, spread out across seven days). Forget “everything in moderation!” and “A little bit of what you fancy does you good!” and: “I always do &lt;a href="/news/world/americas/american-alcohol-consumption-poll-b2807194.html" title="US alcohol consumption hits near-100 year low as fears over heath implications rise"&gt;Dry January&lt;/a&gt;, so…” According to this new report, any alcohol is a potential problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 geLykb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/22/iStock-658672900.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/22/iStock-658672900.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/22/iStock-658672900.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The common belief that a little bit of alcohol might actually be good for the brain – neuroprotective – is almost certainly nonsense" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-148151"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The common belief that a little bit of alcohol might actually be good for the brain – neuroprotective – is almost certainly nonsense&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly? I’m not surprised. Slightly depressed – but not surprised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, I published my new book: &lt;em&gt;How the Female Body Works&lt;/em&gt;. It is the result of two-and-a-half years of hard, joyful research and writing, all focused around interviews with the most knowledgeable academics, medics, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/summer-mood-heat-brain-heatwave-b2779023.html" title="I’m a neuroscientist. Here’s what summer does to your brain"&gt;neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;, gynaecologists, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/sleep-insomnia-meaning-symptoms-help-b2823747.html" title="Insomnia: The misunderstood sleep disorder you probably don’t have"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt; and really any other world-renowned expert in women’s health I could get to talk to me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It covers every stage of women’s lives, from puberty to older age. I wrote it because I realised I knew virtually nothing about my own body, which was absurd. I’d also watched the internet slowly get flooded with contradictory, confusing “advice” and – often contradictory – “wisdom” about women’s bodies, so I set out to get some definitive answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked my experts questions like “What’s a brain made of?”, “are we our personality - or are we our hormones?”, “why are breasts the shape they are? “What makes a hot flush happen? Not just ‘falling oestrogen levels’… What’s the actual function?” Dumb-but-illuminating questions, from an ignoramus, to the people whose life’s work is women’s bodies, what happens to them, and how to heal and support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the facts I came up against really early on was: women are twice as likely to get an &lt;a href="/bulletin/news/alzheimers-disease-cause-treatment-b2833868.html" title="Scientists may have just found a new driver of Alzheimer’s"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis as men. Which troubled me. The other thing, a sort of overarching narrative, which ended up lodged in my consciousness like a bad smell, was that alcohol really isn’t very good for us. It really isn’t. Which is a shame, because it can be so fun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is hard on everyone – implicated in everything from cancer to strokes to heart attacks to infections – but it’s far harder on women than it is on men. This is partly because women’s livers produce less of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH, the purpose of which is to break down and eliminate alcohol from the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gIycYG"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/15/59/9781915780072.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/15/59/9781915780072.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/15/59/9781915780072.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Polly Vernon’s book, ‘How the Female Body Works’, focused around interviews with the most knowledgeable academics, medics, neuroscientists, gynaecologists and psychologists" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-148152"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Polly Vernon’s book, ‘How the Female Body Works’, focused around interviews with the most knowledgeable academics, medics, neuroscientists, gynaecologists and psychologists&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (New River Books)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women’s ADH levels fall further yet, in &lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/yougov-british-government-data-royal-college-of-gps-b2832923.html" title="Women ‘need to be taken seriously’ when they look for GP help – charity"&gt;peri menopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause. Beyond that, the way fat is distributed on a woman’s body means it holds onto alcohol for longer, which means female bodies are exposed to alcohol’s toxicity for longer, leaving women more vulnerable to liver damage, heart disease, and at a higher risk of breast cancer. Oh, and also? While a woman is still experiencing a &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/creatine-for-women-benefits-effects-b2832637.html" title="Why experts are saying creatine might be a wonder supplement for women in midlife"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol will act more aggressively on her body at certain points in that cycle, leaving her (for example) far drunker, far quicker, around the time she’s ovulating, than at any other point. This is because her body is uniquely concerned with getting her pregnant, so tedious things like processing and removing alcohol from her system get jettisoned. I know! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned all this from Dr Sharon Cox, principal research fellow at University College London, an extraordinary scientist, whose work focuses on addictive behaviours, particularly around alcohol and nicotine. All those existing problems, she tells me, have been further exacerbated by, she says: “Women drinking more than we ever have”. Drinking has gone up in both men and women since the pandemic, when we all spent our time making cocktails along with &lt;a href="/arts-entertainment/films/news/devil-wears-prada-2-emily-blunt-heels-wardrobe-b2818974.html" title="Emily Blunt says Devil Wears Prada 2 has been a ‘rude awakening’"&gt;Stanley Tucci &lt;/a&gt;on YouTube because there was nothing else to do, and the world was &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;. “This is particularly in people over 30, and the increase in drinking was sharper in women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why?” I ask. “Stress?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These large national surveys tell us what is happening – not why. But yeah, it’s probably that alcohol was used as a stress relief - and it’s a difficult rut to get out from. [The increase has] mostly sustained.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At no point did Dr Cox tell me not to drink. She herself drinks… well, moderately. As do I. Assuming the concept of “moderately” means anything, after this latest report, which it probably doesn’t. In fact, none of the experts with whom I spoke for my book told me not to drink, or told me to tell my readers not to drink. It’s just that, when you interview – in depth – 20-ish of the world’s leading specialists on all aspects of women’s health, and nearly &lt;em&gt;every last one&lt;/em&gt; of them alludes, en passant, to booze, in a dispassionate, non-judgemental, scientific, but repeatedly critical way, for all manner of reasons, from all their different perspectives and individual areas of study, it’s tough to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now a new study emerges, connecting any alcohol consumption at all with possible increased risk of dementia – one which is already twice as high in women, as it is in men – and… I sort of want to give booze up, right here and now. Don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 geLykb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/24/sarah-jessica-parker_10.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/24/sarah-jessica-parker_10.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/24/sarah-jessica-parker_10.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Drinking has gone up in both men and women since the pandemic when we all spent our time making cocktails, a tipple favoured by Carrie Bradshaw on ‘Sex and the City’" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-148153"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Drinking has gone up in both men and women since the pandemic when we all spent our time making cocktails, a tipple favoured by Carrie Bradshaw on ‘Sex and the City’&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (HBO Max)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly? I sort of already have. If pre-book, I was “moderate” in my drinking, I’d now describe myself as not exactly sober… But really, not&lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt;sober, either. Physically, I have felt that enzyme in my liver, ADH, falter with age, got to a point where now, the very first sip of wine (once, so joyful, so promising, so potent!) triggers memories not of my last fun, feckless night out – but of my last &lt;a href="/travel/europe/spain/ibiza/ibiza-wellness-gen-x-raver-b2823880.html" title="I’m a Gen X retired raver – here’s how I swapped hedonism for high-end wellness in Ibiza"&gt;hangover&lt;/a&gt;, the associated anxiety and anguish, all of which, by the way, were the consequence of barely three-and-a-half glasses of house white! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being drunk used to be so fun! The silliness of tipsiness, the sweet slipe-slide toward disinhibition! I’m wondering if this instinctual and informed growing wariness around booze, coupled with a desire not to live a sober life, might explain the increasing number of people I know, ditching alcohol. The brilliant neuroscientist I interviewed for the book, Dr Sarah McKay, told me she’s hopeful the way women live their lives now – how much more educated we are, how much more likely to work, and have good, deep, social connections – which also leaves us at an advantage over earlier generations of women in terms of neuroprotection – our brains’ defences against cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, should we just be giving up alcohol, full stop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask Dr Federica Amati. She’s the head nutritionist at &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/house-garden/bedroom/best-anti-snore-pillow-uk-b1828630.html" title="11 best anti-snore pillows, tried and tested for better sleep"&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted source; earlier this summer, she caused ructions on Paul Sculfor’s&lt;em&gt; This Is Powerful &lt;/em&gt;podcast by saying: “If you look at alcohol as a drug – like, as a pharmaceutical drug… they’ve calculated what the safe amount would be to consume before these neurotoxic, genotoxic {when a substance damages DNA] effects.

The condition resembles a combination of dementia, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease (MND) and is normally fatal within two decades after symptoms start to show. Matt became symptomatic two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Until now there has been no treatment. But on Wednesday &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevz13xkxpro" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;researchers reported how a new gene therapy had managed to slow progress of the disease by 75%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It is like winning the lottery 10 times over," says Gemma, 45.

They decided they wanted to screen out the gene that causes the disease. They had two options – either have a version of IVF whereby the embryo is tested for the gene before implantation, or conceive naturally and have the developing embryo tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They opted for the latter, but to be eligible for this couples have to agree to abort the foetus if the test is positive, as it was in their second pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We thought carefully about what we wanted to do. In the Huntington's community not everyone agrees with screening it out. But we both knew we did not want our children growing up with the possibility of having this gene. It is such a cruel, cruel disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'Hope where there was no hope'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Matt, now 43, is still able to walk, but has become clumsy with his movement and also been affected mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"He has angry outbursts and has no empathy altogether. For example, if one of the children hurts themselves he will laugh. It's worse when he's tired. That's how Huntington's works – it alters your personality and that is incredibly hard for the children to understand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Matt no longer works, having had to retire on health grounds when his symptoms started to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"In some ways we are lucky he got past 40 with no signs of it," says Gemma. "His mother died from the disease when she was 40. And now we have the prospect of a treatment. We have got hope where there was no hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She says that is a sentiment that will be felt by the whole Huntington's disease community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I work in the evenings as a counsellor, often with people with Huntington's disease. I trained partly to give something back to the community and because we needed the money as Matt is no longer earning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I often support people just after they have been tested for it. Depression is the most common issue as they feel all is lost. That is why the news about the treatment is so important. It will give everyone a lift," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Our neighbours and friends are even talking about fundraising so we can pay for the treatment. I just hope it is made available on the NHS quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;That, of course, is the question on the mind of everyone who has been affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The BBC has been contacted by numerous families who have lost whole generations to the illness and others who have lost their loved ones to suicide because they were unable to face the inevitable decline that follows a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dave, 73, from the West Midlands, lost his wife to Huntington's. His son now has the disease and he is worried the gene may have been passed on to his granddaughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It is horrible to see your loved ones suffer," he says. "This treatment is desperately needed on the NHS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;The path to the NHS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Whether and how quickly the treatment will become available is not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The company behind the therapy, uniQure, says it will apply for a licence in the US in the first quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Once regulators there have assessed it and, if they approve it for use, the UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), can piggyback off their work and put it through a quick regulatory process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But that is only to decide if it is safe and effective. It will be up to another body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), to decide if it is affordable to be used on the NHS in England and Wales. A separate body makes that calculation for Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;As a gene therapy involving brain surgery, it will be expensive. However, sources at NICE say that is not necessarily a deal-breaker. They point to the fact that a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2yg9yny0ko" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;sickle cell therapy&lt;/a&gt; that costs £1.65 million per patient and a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nnn51rdrzo" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;haemophilia B one&lt;/a&gt; that cost £2.6 million have already been backed by the health assessment body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Sources there said the earliest the Huntington's therapy could possibly be expected to be approved is the first half of 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But that's only if everything else goes smoothly - and there are more hurdles to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So far, just the headline findings have been released. Scientists say the full study needs to be published and assessed by independent experts to properly assess what has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The study is also relatively small - there were just 29 participants who were followed for 36 months. This is not unusual for gene therapies, and others have made it onto the NHS off the back of small-scale trials. The case for this treatment is particularly strong given there are no current treatment options for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But even if this therapy is licensed, it is only going to help a small portion of Huntington's disease patients as it's aimed at those with early-stage symptoms or those who haven't developed any yet. The complex nature of the surgery also means only specialist centres will be able to perform it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some scientists have pointed out that it is not yet certain the benefits will last long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Prof David Rubinsztein, deputy director of the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, says the scale of this breakthrough should still not be underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says it offers "real hope" for this devastating disease and if the approach is successfully validated in the coming months it could even have broader implications for treating other neurodegenerative diseases from Parkinson's disease and MND to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Gemma appreciates there is still some way to go before Matt can benefit, but she says for the first time in a long time she can be optimistic about the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's like a dream - I can start thinking about growing old with my husband.

And though the illness is not transmitted from person to person or in this case from animal to person, it’s likely that if a pet dog is diagnosed with Valley fever, their owner could have it, too, she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was another just amazing discovery, like probably one of the most thrilling discoveries I think I've ever been involved in in my research career, just to see that dogs were telling us so much about this disease in people,” Sykes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Coccidioidomycosis.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Initial symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Valley fever can be mistaken for flu symptoms and include fever, cough and fatigue. As the disease progresses, severe symptoms including joint pain, severe headaches and skin lesions can develop if the spores disseminate in the body.

Infection numbers are also surging in Los Angeles and Riverside counties, with 1,030 and 361 cases this year, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking animal cases is typically not done by any public health agency, the release stated.

          &lt;p&gt;A 63-year-old woman showed up at the emergency department of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston with severe stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told doctors that for the past month she had developed severe nausea, non-bloody vomiting, and pain she described as a burning feeling that spread from her upper abdomen, through her right side, and around to her back. Nothing she did made it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors started collecting her medical history, which was lengthy. The woman had Type 2 diabetes, Stage 2 chronic kidney disease, opioid use disorder, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), among other conditions. While she was taking many medications, she noted that for the past year she had also been taking semaglutide, a GLP-1 weight-loss drug, and had lost about 40 pounds (over 19 percent of her body weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMimc2502450"&gt;an interactive case report&lt;/a&gt; published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, the doctors laid out how they figured out what was going on and treated it—with a surprisingly simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors started doing lab tests and imaging, and they admitted her to the hospital. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen revealed bile-duct enlargement and a swollen stomach that seemed to be full of a semi-solid mass. Similarly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also picked up a mass in her stomach, one with mottling that doctors assumed were air bubbles. The imaging also found bile duct enlargement, which could be linked to her history of opioid use—or to a gastric bezoar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gastric bezoars are masses that form in the stomach. There are different kinds depending on what the masses are made of. The most common is a phytobezoar, which is made from clumped fruit and vegetable components, particularly non-digestible materials such as cellulose. A notable subtype of phytobezoar is the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2657263/"&gt;diospyrobezoar&lt;/a&gt;, which is formed from eating an excessive amount of persimmons.  The fruit's skin is brimming with tannins that form a glue-like substance when they hit gastric acid, aiding the formation of a mass that is notoriously hard and difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;

I was in so much pain it was ruining my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"But when I finally got to see an NHS gynaecologist and asked to be put on the list for a hysterectomy, the consultant's words were: 'You're too young, you'll lose your fertility'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"But I didn't want my fertility, I wanted my quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A hysterectomy will remove symptoms of adenomyosis, though it is not a cure for endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, Ms Boocock said three months on from her surgery life was "just fantastic".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I would love these diseases to be taken more seriously," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Consultant gynaecologist Anthony Griffiths says it has long been known that there are increased risks for women with adenomyosis during pregnancy and labour&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Griffiths said medical textbooks from a decade ago defined adenomyosis as a "disease of ladies in their 40s" with heavy vaginal bleeding that was not easily controlled with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"But that's not true at all," he said. "That's a myth, mainly because we didn't have tools to diagnose it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said high quality MRIs were now detecting the condition in much younger women, and that around a third of the women he saw with endometriosis had some adenomyosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Adenomyosis and endometriosis are different diseases, but there are similarities – people can present with heavy periods, agonizing pain often with periods but it can be throughout the menstrual cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dee Montague-Coast, from the charity Fair Treatment for the Women of Wales - which chairs the women's health Wales coalition - said there were more than 158,000 people living with adenomyosis in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Yet in our experience, people won't have heard of it before," she said.

More investment is needed in research to understand its potential impact on fertility, miscarriage, and premature birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"At the same time, urgent action is required to reduce gynaecology waiting lists, with over 54,000 women in Wales currently waiting for care for conditions such as adenomyosis - conditions that can have a severe impact on quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We welcome the Welsh government's recognition of adenomyosis in the Women's Health Plan. However, women's health continues to be chronically underfunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The RCOG is calling on governments to prioritise investment in research, diagnostics, and treatments so that women affected by adenomyosis and similar conditions can access the care and answers they deserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The Welsh Government said endometriosis and adenomyosis was "one of the eight priority areas in the Women's Health Plan for Wales which outlines how we are determined to improve women's health services and women's experience of those services".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Funding of £3m is being used to deliver the actions in the plan, with a specific focus on establishing a Women's Health Hub in every health board by March 2026, as well as supporting timely diagnosis and management of conditions including adenomyosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="if-you-have-been-affected-by-the-issues-raised-in-this-story,-information-and-support-can-be-found-via-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;&lt;b id="if-you-have-been-affected-by-the-issues-raised-in-this-story,-information-and-support-can-be-found-via-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found via the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4WLs5NlwrySXJR2n8Snszdg/information-and-support-suicide-feelings-of-despair" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc's-action-line" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;&lt;b id="bbc's-action-line" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;BBC's Action Line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="website." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;&lt;b id="website." class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt; website.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 21:48:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1mZ2NBRTRtZGl5VVZlaVNlb3ZlQWJqOG05bDVFRXlveW1OMVgxdkszci1RRzhSTWNub2pJTkdjUk5WM0Fqa2dVcW5yTlFlZXBkNENGQ3hpY05LUdIBX0FVX3lxTFBUQzhGN2NVWERVbHdZTWVTcnpoMjViakFUZVFWeTBOU1lkZmNUa1VYWmNQeldUMTV6OXpVUjZtWDkxRGJxWmxKcV9MY0VHQy1HSEttYllZRW14ZzZEQXRj</guid></item><item><title>由于禽流感卷土重来，近35,000只火鸡在犹他州中部设施死亡- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51381466/nearly-35000-turkeys-killed-off-at-central-utah-facility-as-bird-flu-returns-</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAYLORSVILLE — Nearly 35,000 turkeys were recently culled after cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza were detected at a commercial turkey facility in central Utah, state agriculture officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu was found within an undisclosed facility in Sanpete County, leading to the decision to depopulate to prevent further spread of the viral infection, which often leads to "high death rates in flocks," Utah Department of Agriculture and Food officials said. They add they're "working closely" with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service to investigate the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other commercial facilities in the region have been quarantined, as state and federal officials coordinate "additional surveillance and testing" in areas around the affected flock. In a statement, Utah Department of Agriculture and Food Commissioner Kelly Pehrson said the cases involve "a single round of birds from one facility," and it's not expected to noticeably affect turkey availability in Utah or in the U.S. ahead of Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The loss of this flock is a significant hardship for the producer and their community, and our team is working closely with them to minimize the risk of spread to other facilities," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident marks Utah's first major outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in months, &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51251607/bird-flu-found-in-wildlife-across-10-utah-counties-since-november" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;after several outbreaks across the state in fall 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Suspected outbreaks were also found in wild bird populations in early 2025, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 15,000 to 25,000 &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51249180/as-many-as-25000-grebes-killed-by-bird-flu-within-great-salt-lake-utah-officials-say" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;grebes near the Great Salt Lake earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The flu is often spread by contact with migratory waterfowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 4.3 million birds have been affected by avian influenza outbreaks in the state, including over two dozen commercial flocks and another dozen backyard flocks, since a nationwide outbreak began in early 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major nationwide upticks at points beginning in 2022 and late 2024 helped &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51273687/egg-prices-continue-to-hit-records-as-easter-and-passover-approach-some-relief-may-come" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;cause egg prices to soar to record highs&lt;/a&gt;, which lingered into this year. U.S. farmers have been forced to cull more than 165 million birds since 2022, including more than 30 million egg-laying chickens, the Associated Press reported in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices have come down since the latest spike, although they remain higher than historical averages. Large Grade A eggs cost an average of about $3.59 per dozen in August, down from a record $6.23 per dozen in March, &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000708111" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;. That's compared to $1.33 per dozen five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 2022, the previous record high was $2.97 per dozen, set in 2015 during a smaller outbreak of avian influenza. The average boneless chicken price has fallen from a record $4.75 per pound in September 2022 to $4.21 in August of this year, but that's also $1.25 per pound higher than the five-year low point, the central bank reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey prices often fluctuate in response to varying demands. Pehrson said Friday that Utah consumers "should feel confident that turkey and poultry products remain safe and readily available" despite the latest incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency urges poultry owners to "vigilantly watch" their flocks for signs of avian influenza, which include unusually high numbers of flock deaths, as well as symptoms like nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption, and the lack of coordination in birds. They're also asked to contact the Utah State Veterinarian's Office as soon as they see these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been some human cases since 2022, but state officials add that the highly pathogenic avian influenza doesn't pose an "immediate risk to public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

But NAD supplements &lt;em&gt;might &lt;/em&gt;just be the next closest thing to a capsule you can swallow to increase your healthspan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, otherwise known as NAD (and sometimes referred to by its other formats, NAD+ or NADH), stands for a naturally occurring molecule in our bodies that decreases as we age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a reasonable hypothesis that the declines in NAD might contribute to disease and dysfunction as we age, and that supplementing NAD would be a way to restore it and improve our health holistically,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://kin.umn.edu/daniel-craighead"&gt;Daniel Craighead, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37068054/"&gt;published research&lt;/a&gt; on NAD-boosting compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that giving animals the NAD precursors nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) — the building blocks that create NAD — can improve several biomarkers for &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.056589"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6787556/"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5686634/"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5840929/"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39513906/"&gt;skin anti-aging&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caveat? So far, only a small number of short-term studies on humans have been done, and the results of those are more mixed. But there have been some benefits seen in people with type 2 diabetes or peripheral artery disease, and other positive results, such as an overall reduction in inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's important to have a big picture of health — we stress whole foods, exercise, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, those things first,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vailhealth.org/about/doctor-directory/barry-sandler"&gt;Barry Sandler, DO&lt;/a&gt;, an osteopathic physician specializing in anti-aging medicine at Vail Health. “But I think NAD is safe and looks promising for most people.” He and other experts recommend that anyone interested in taking NAD supplements check with their physician first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD is a large molecule, so it can't actually enter cells. Experts are skeptical of NAD IV drips and anything that says it contains actual NAD due to the size of the molecule and the fact that NAD can’t survive outside of certain conditions. The best way to maximise natural NAD production in the body is by boosting precursors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part, however, is that supplements containing these precursors aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so it can feel a bit like the Wild West trying to figure out your best options. “&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11335992/"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; came out where they randomly sampled NMN supplements on the market, and most had much less of the ingredient than advertised,” Dr Craighead says. And since these capsules aren’t cheap, you want to be sure you get what you’re paying for. So we asked experts for their top recommendations. Here, they share what to look for in a good NAD supplement, including options they use themselves or have seen their patients find success with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you can trust IndyBest U.S. reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/author/jennifer-heimlich"&gt;Jennifer Heimlich&lt;/a&gt; has more than a decade of experience as a journalist within the wellness industry, so she is a reliable and knowledgeable voice when it comes to recommendations.

Most days, that quiet background barely draws notice. Some days, it fluctuates more strongly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study behind this article asked a simple question: when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthpedia-articles/earths-magnetic-field-origin-structure-and-impact-on-humanity/"&gt;Earth’s magnetic field&lt;/a&gt; gets unsettled, as it does during solar storms, is there a direct correlation to the number of heart attacks reported in humans on Earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors in Brazil analyzed hospital admissions for myocardial infarction (heart attacks) over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tracked age, sex, and whether patients survived to discharge. Then they set those numbers alongside daily magnetic activity scores to see whether patterns aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only after the team matched health records with &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/space-weather/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;space weather&lt;/a&gt; data did a pattern emerge clearly enough to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corresponding author, Luiz Felipe Campos de Rezende at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (&lt;a href="http://www3.inpe.br/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;INPE&lt;/a&gt;), later explained what they saw and how they checked it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This included comparisons across age groups and a second, computer-based analysis to verify the signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solar-storms-and-human-heart-attacks"&gt;Solar storms and human heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question was specific: do heart attack admissions, and in-hospital deaths tied to those events, show different timing on days when the magnetic field is more disturbed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to know if women and men responded the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did not try to prove cause and effect. They looked for an association in the timing of outcomes across calm, moderate, and disturbed days. That frame kept the analysis grounded in what the records could support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Planetary Index (Kp-Index)&lt;/a&gt; – a standard global index that classifies each day’s magnetic activity from very quiet to very disturbed. That gave them a simple daily label to compare with the hospital totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They grouped the calendar into quiet, moderate, and disturbed days, then counted admissions and in-hospital deaths in each bucket. They split those counts by sex and age group to see where differences stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-showed"&gt;What the numbers showed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On days when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nasa-warns-sun-is-waking-up-again-activity-could-affect-gps-radio-power-grid/"&gt;the Sun&lt;/a&gt; was highly active and solar storms disturbed Earth’s magnetic field, women had a higher rate of heart attack admissions than on quiet days. The signal was most visible among middle-aged and older women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same age groups, in-hospital deaths also rose on disturbed days compared with quiet ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men did not show the same clear increase on disturbed days in those groups, even though they accounted for more admissions overall in the dataset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s point was not about who has more heart attacks in general, but whether the timing shifted with space weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-timing-heart-attacks-with-solar-activity"&gt;Timing heart attacks with solar activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists classified the days analyzed as calm, moderate, or disturbed. The health data were divided by sex and age group [up to 30 years old; between 31 and 60; over 60 years old].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s worth noting that the number of heart attacks among men is almost twice as high – regardless of geomagnetic conditions,” Luiz Felipe Campos de Rezende, a researcher at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and the corresponding author of the article, told &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Agência FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when we look at the relative frequency rate of cases, we find that for women, it’s significantly higher during disturbed geomagnetic conditions compared to calm conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the 31-60 age group, it’s up to three times higher. Therefore, our results suggest that women are more susceptible to geomagnetic conditions,” Rezende expounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adding-layers-of-confidence"&gt;Adding layers of confidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics can mislead if one method biases the result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To guard against that, the team used clustering, which groups similar cases without pre-labeling what should matter. They fed the model each day’s magnetic category and strength (Kp-Index), along with sex and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cluster highlighted disturbed-day cases with a predominance of women in their mid-60s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That lined up with the simpler counts, adding another layer of confidence that the observed pattern was not a quirk of a single approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-statistically-significant-link"&gt;Statistically significant link&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an &lt;a href="https://toolkit.ncats.nih.gov/glossary/observational-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;observational study&lt;/a&gt; using historical records from one city. Observational means no experiment and no intervention – only careful matching of timelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By design, that cannot prove that a magnetic disturbance triggers a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it can say is that admissions and in-hospital deaths among women, especially in older groups, tended to be more frequent on days when solar storms disturbed Earth’s geomagnetic field than on quiet ones within the studied setting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are clear about that limit and avoid causal claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-link-is-plausible"&gt;Why this link is plausible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart runs on tiny &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/study-says-mouth-bacteria-play-key-role-in-heart-attacks-upending-conventional-wisdom/"&gt;electrical signals&lt;/a&gt; that coordinate each beat. Nerves rely on electrical pulses, and many body rhythms follow cycles that can be nudged by outside cues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists think external electromagnetic variations could add a small nudge to systems already under strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone has vulnerable arteries or a rhythm on edge, even a subtle push might affect when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/subtle-warning-signs-what-a-heart-attack-really-feels-like/"&gt;an event occurs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a hypothesis. The study did not test a mechanism, but it points to a focused question that further research can take on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-larger-datasets-and-forecasting"&gt;Larger datasets and forecasting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger datasets drawn from multiple regions and latitudes could test whether the same timing pattern holds across different magnetic environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More detailed patient information – medications, underlying conditions, and daily factors – could clarify who is most sensitive and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing health records with local magnetic measurements and other environmental variables, like temperature and air quality, would help separate overlapping influences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of design moves the field from suggestive timing links toward causal explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists around the world have been trying to predict the occurrence of geomagnetic disturbances, but the accuracy, for now, isn’t good,” Rezende says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When this type of service is more advanced – and if the impact of magnetic disturbances on the heart is confirmed – we’ll be able to consider prevention strategies from a public health perspective, especially for individuals who already suffer from heart problems,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solar-storms-heart-attacks-and-next-steps"&gt;Solar storms, heart attacks, and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health teams already use short-term alerts for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/double-threat-heat-and-pollution-amplify-health-risks-in-american-cities/"&gt;heat and pollution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future work confirms a definitively reliable association between solar storms and higher rates of heart attack admissions, hospitals could plan for a small uptick in cardiology load during strong disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with known heart disease could follow common-sense steps that clinicians routinely advise, with extra attention during solar storm notices: take prescribed medications, watch for symptoms, and avoid unusual exertion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those actions fit standard care and require no alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many more questions need to be answered, but the evidence presented from this study leaves no doubt that there is “something” there that justifies further investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, keep an eye on the Space Weather Prediction Center (&lt;a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SWPC&lt;/a&gt;) alerts and act accordingly. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when the “being safe” part doesn’t require much effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00887-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:00:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOUzFkM3FmY2ZsNHUwWVYtLUh3ek1uM3gyZWpRVWRTUTFoLXd1UmdGUTFRVi1hWE1fVnViUENWLVBRWjJMVVB1NmtCZVFyS1gtdDhlVHJ3S0JPVENjd3ZQcktuOFByc2hqQzJCQzA5TFdzWjdBUnNHSUE1cnhfOXhuLTI1bWFDU1A4WVJQYWQ1WThtWkt2YkFwdHlGNjFXZTRZbW1fNW1R</guid></item><item><title>令人震惊的研究显示，患有痴呆症风险因素的年轻人数量翻了一番-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15137119/risk-dementia-study-cognitive-health.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Twice the amount of young people are now at a heightened risk of dementia than there were a decade ago, new research shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans, particularly young Americans, have experienced a 40 percent increase in the rate of cognitive disability over the past decade, rising from about 5 million people reporting a disability to about 7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a new study from Yale researchers have found rates of people aged 18 to 39 who self-report cognitive decline nearly doubled from five percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A group of American researchers surveyed 4.5 million American adults 18 and older from 2013 to 2023 on their cognitive abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, among all respondents, the percentage of people self-reporting cognitive disability, such as difficulty with memory and performing daily tasks, rose from 5.3 percent to 7.4 percent over the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13010475/midlife-crisis-early-onset-dementia-diagnosed-memory-robbing-disorder.html"&gt;core signals&lt;/a&gt; that something is wrong -a cognitive disability, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is the pivotal stage between normal aging and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With about 80 percent of individuals with MCI progressing to dementia within six years, cognitive symptoms are a clear signal of significantly elevated risk for irreversible neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the results, researchers concluded that young adults were the primary driver of the overall rise in cognitive disability in the US and, potentially, the general increase in the number of Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14957117/unlikely-group-early-onset-alzheimers-disease.html" class=""&gt;diagnosed with dementia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the study led by Yale University researchers, cognitive disability was defined as an affirmative answer to the question, ‘Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?’ (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study author Dr Adam de Havenon, a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-f0469070-9ae5-11f0-8ab3-932b928d798f"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement: ‘Challenges with memory and thinking have emerged as a leading health issue reported by US adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our study shows that these difficulties may be becoming more widespread, especially among younger adults, and that social and structural factors likely play a key role.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cognitive impairment is the second most common type of disability in the US, with roughly six to 11 percent of Americans affected, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) report indicated that number may actually be even higher, with a prevalence of 14 percent. This would make it the most frequently reported disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To determine how the condition’s prevalence has risen, researchers used the BRFSS survey, which is an ongoing national telephone survey that collects health-related information from millions of adults in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cognitive disability was defined as an affirmative answer to the question, ‘Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to rates doubling in adults under 40, there were major disparities among demographic groups and along financial lines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American Indian/Alaska Native individuals saw the highest jump, from 7.5 percent in 2013 to more than 11 percent in 2023, a 49 percent spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Black and Hispanic adults also &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6038509/Black-people-face-28-greater-risk-dementia.html"&gt;showed elevated rates&lt;/a&gt; compared to white adults, while Asian adults had the lowest rates of cognitive disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found that income &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-5154129/Alzheimers-falls-11-year-spent-education.html"&gt;and education level&lt;/a&gt; were key contributors to cognitive health. People making less than $35,000 per year were more likely to report cognitive decline, while those with incomes over $75,000 had substantially lower rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to a new study analyzing a decade of data from 4.5 million Americans, reports of cognitive disability have surged by 40 percent. The prevalence rose from five percent to over seven percent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows that rates of reported cognitive disability nearly doubled among adults 18 to 39, while rates for older adults remained relatively stable or even declined&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with a high school education were also more likely to report these issues compared to those with advanced degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While rates increased for all income levels, the absolute gap between the richest and poorest widened by 1.4 percentage points over the decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These findings suggest we’re seeing the steepest increases in memory and thinking problems among people who already face structural disadvantages,’ de Havenon added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reports of disability rose from nine percent in 2013 to 12.6 percent in 2023 in the lower income group.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor and minority groups are far more likely to experience worse overall health than their higher-income counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, their access to healthcare, including screening for cognitive impairment that could be a prelude to dementia, is out of reach due to distance from providers or prohibitive costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the survey does not measure clinical cognitive impairment, de Havenon emphasized that the sharp rise in young adults reporting cognitive disability signals a significant public health trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One leading theory for the rise in reported cognitive issues is the impact of long Covid, which is estimated to affect roughly &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html"&gt;17 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prevalence of cognitive disability increased across all groups from 2013-2023, shown in each graph, but rates were consistently highest among racial minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the pandemic, a common complaint among individuals who contracted Covid has been persistent brain fog, or a feeling of mental cloudiness or difficulty thinking clearly, which often continues long after the initial infection has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in the latest study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214226"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers excluded 2020 because of the significant disruptions in data collection caused by the pandemic, which affected response rates and the quality of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People managing chronic physical conditions were far more likely to also struggle with serious memory and thinking problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults who had survived a stroke were the most affected, with nearly one in five reporting significant cognitive disability in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The elevated risk extended to common conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults with high blood pressure were 30 percent more likely to report serious cognitive difficulties than those without it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk was even greater for people with diabetes, who saw a nearly 50 percent higher prevalence of cognitive disability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;De Havenon said: ‘More research is also needed to understand what’s driving the large increase in rates among younger adults, given the potential long-term implications for health, workforce productivity and health care systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It could reflect actual changes in brain health, better awareness and willingness to report problems, or other health and social factors. But regardless of possible causes, the rise is real—and it’s especially pronounced in people under 40.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 19:27:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQWVBvRFZpNi16amNKNTlMTXkwSmJ3WTdiUDliaXBUWXZPUEhDZDRuRzdYSDNvWDZoUEtubTRYd24yOTZKN2xjRDlDNldySXBQZVBIRWMzNW5nR1FydkdoWUIwTVZ6ME4tSkxEN2lyX2xqczk5YUluaWRQM2N2eFJRSU9sMEhMUVFQMHR6VEpNMXd3Ym10R2NLbNIBngFBVV95cUxQTlFDc2lKaG1ZeDhseGl3cUlFN0wtMDhCakczNHBuTzEwd3BlNTVjQ3UycFFjR0F1ckwwTno5SlhmNHI2RFBxSVk4eUZOY3V4b2xCNlo0cnUxS3BTZkhKQXhlclpqT2lZVnJzdlpCdVQ5RlRsZlI1NTJPWjZfZENVY0dTenR2bEozWDdmWHV3VGJoZ1JzMTdwMVllQXlRQQ</guid></item><item><title>天然植物化合物显示出治疗牙龈疾病的承诺-SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/natural-plant-compound-shows-promise-for-treating-gum-disease/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

Researchers in Brazil encapsulated this substance in a controlled-release powder that mimics powdered milk, with the aim of creating oral care products that work without the side effects often seen in traditional treatments.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morin-based powder, derived from guava leaves, apple peel, and figs, can be gradually released using polymers and offers a potential substitute for antibiotics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powder formulated from morin, a natural compound found in guava leaves, apple and fig peels, certain teas, and almonds, demonstrated antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity against the bacteria responsible for periodontal disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers expect that delivering the substance through polymers for controlled release could support nonsurgical therapies and serve as an alternative to antibiotics in managing harmful microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In laboratory experiments, scientists at the Araraquara School of Dentistry at São Paulo State University (FOAr-UNESP) in Brazil evaluated morin on a multispecies biofilm composed of different bacterial strains designed to mimic the disease’s impact on patients’ gums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Archives of Oral Biology&lt;/em&gt;. The study was conducted by Luciana Solera Sales during her doctoral studies at FOAr-UNESP, under the supervision of Fernanda Lourenção Brighenti. FAPESP supported the study through a doctorate and a research internship abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

The final product is intended for use by people with reduced motor skills, such as older adults and patients with special needs, who are unable to brush their teeth properly.

&lt;p&gt;Other researchers involved in the study included Andréia Bagliotti Meneguin from the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara (FCFAr) at UNESP; Hernane da Silva Barud from the University of Araraquara (UNIARA); and Michael Robert Milward from the Faculty of Dentistry at the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_1050036bab29c144a0a998377d41f37d" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;University of Birmingham&lt;/span&gt; in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Developing oral hygiene platforms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the moment, we have a fine powder obtained through spray drying – which is the same equipment used to make powdered milk – that can be used to make various types of oral hygiene products. The idea is to provide a platform that acts as an adjunct and can be useful, for example, for people with reduced motor skills who are unable to brush their teeth properly, such as older adults and patients with special needs,” says Brighenti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morin was chosen because it is a natural, inexpensive, and easily accessible compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Morin is a flavonoid that can be obtained from various fruits. But simply eating it isn’t enough; the substance needs to be processed. The idea is to take advantage of this natural compound, its benefits, and its advantages, and transform it all so that it can be used to prevent and treat tooth decay and periodontal disease,” Sales points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Controlled release and product improvement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brighenti and her colleagues have been developing what she describes as platforms that enable various substances to act on the diseases under investigation. She explains that this approach is important because most natural compounds do not dissolve easily in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a constant flow of saliva. We produce, on average, 1 milliliter of saliva per minute. Anything we put in our mouths is quickly removed by saliva, especially because it has a smell and taste, which stimulates salivary flow. When we have something that sticks to the mucous membrane of the mouth, the inside of our cheeks, and our teeth, it gives us an additional advantage. This controlled release also helps us control the toxicity and stability of the substance,” the professor explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of morin, the challenge was to optimize what the group had developed thus far, making it more appealing to potential patients while developing something scalable for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to provide an alternative to products currently available on the market that don’t meet the demand because they have some side effects reported by patients, such as taste changes and increased tartar buildup, as well as stains on the teeth with prolonged use,” Brighenti adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We started developing these systems in the form of tablets, films, and microparticles. But until then, they were too large and unfeasible for oral use. In my PhD, we tried to improve these products by making them smaller. That’s why I developed this format, which looks like powdered milk. I prepared a solution containing sodium alginate and gellan gum to encapsulate morin in a controlled-release system, which is already widely used for drugs but isn’t yet widely used in dentistry,” Sales explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Global burden of oral disease&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Periodontal disease develops when biofilm or bacterial plaque accumulates on the teeth. This sticky layer, made up of bacteria and food particles, can damage the gums over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its advanced stage, known as periodontitis, ranks as the sixth most common chronic disease globally. Early symptoms may include bleeding, but as the condition worsens, it can eventually cause tooth loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper oral hygiene, including brushing, flossing, and using fluoride toothpaste, can considerably decrease this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022, nearly half of the world’s population (45%) suffers from oral diseases, amounting to approximately 3.5 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to continue testing morin first in animal models and then in clinical studies to investigate its other properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We observed with the naked eye that the in vitro biofilm treated with morin in the laboratory is less stained than when treated in its free form. So, it’s possible that there’s an advantage, that this system helps prevent tooth discoloration. We also need to test, for example, whether morin maintains the balance of the oral cavity, because we don’t want to eliminate all bacteria from patients’ mouths,” says Brighenti.&lt;/p&gt;

Now scientists are hopeful a key protein in the brain could reveal the likelihood of someone developing the disease so that preventative treatments can be administered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid plaques &lt;span&gt;are a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and contribute to cognitive decline and memory loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Notably, female mice had higher TSPO levels, mirroring real-world statistics: two-thirds of Alzheimer's patients are women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain tissue samples from the Colombian patients with the rare genetic mutation (PSEN1 E280A), known as the paisa mutation, that almost always leads to early-onset Alzheimer's, showed the same pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that elevated levels of TSPO - as seen in medical imaging of the brain - could indicate a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with strong genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's show elevated TSPO early, which supports the theory that brain inflammation is an early driver of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers now want to look at this link further to better understand the role that TSPO plays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are unsure if it contributes to damage or protects the brain – and whether blocking or enhancing it could halt disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.fiu.edu/2025/can-we-detect-alzheimers-disease-decades-before-symptoms-start"&gt;Lead researcher&lt;/a&gt; Dr Tomás Guilarte said: 'This is the first study to really examine how early this biomarker increases and where it begins rising in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we can use this information to help delay Alzheimer's progression by even five years, it can drastically improve patients' lives and reduce disease prevalence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Guilarte is considered an internationally established expert on TSPO and he has studied the protein for more than three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His work helped establish it as a reliable imaging biomarker used in diagnosing brain inflammation in various neurodegenerative, neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in late-stage Alzheimer's, the researchers found that TSPO levels remained high in the immune cells in the brain (microglia) that are found close to amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A cell image showing immune cells in the brain (microglia) (blue) signaling TSPO (red) and clustered around plaques (cyan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Guilarte's previous study, published in JAMA Neurology, showed TSPO levels were higher in active and recently retired NFL players ranging in age from 23 to 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is now working with a specially developed Alzheimer's mouse model lacking TSPO to explore these questions further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're also expanding the study to include sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer's cases, the form that accounts for over 90 percent of all diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more we understand these processes,' said Daniel Martínez Pérez, first author and Ph. candidate in Dr Guilarte's lab, 'the closer we get to tailoring treatments that can truly help – before it's too late.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'One of the biggest problems with Alzheimer's is people see it as a disease of aging and that impacts when people get diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the reality is that the disease starts decades before diagnosis and the more biomarkers and therapeutic targets our global community of scientists are finding, the closer we all get to physicians having a whole panel of diagnostics to be able to deliver more personalized, tailored treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hope is we can be part of helping people before they are too sick.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects adults over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About seven million people in the US aged 65 and older live with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13million Americans will be living with the disease. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's affects a small subset of the population diagnosed with this memory-robbing form of dementia caused by shrinking brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538053/"&gt;Five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nearly seven million Americans with the disease are diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65, well before the average diagnosis age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is not solely Alzheimer's disease at a younger age. It &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13538685/major-study-dementia-risk-mother-earlier-father.html"&gt;often runs in families&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, it's passed down directly from parent to child, while in others, people may inherit a mix of genes that increase their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease tends to progress faster in people with an early-onset diagnosis compared to those who develop it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after accounting for the general risks of aging, people with early-onset Alzheimer's have a higher risk of dying compared to those with late-onset or typical Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes a significant number of premature deaths in adults aged 40 to 64 caused by complications due to Alzheimer's, like infections, seizures, and pneumonia caused by food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wide variety of causes of death means quantifying the annual death toll linked to the condition is difficult to pin down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, about 120,000 people with Alzheimer's, both typical and early-onset, died in 2022 (the most recent year for which data is available). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can mix and match meals if there’s one you don’t like. Feel free to repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18045/weight-loss-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. Because we created this plan for weight loss, we aimed for 1,500 calories per day with at least 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber per day. If you’re making a swap, you may want to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile or adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if you prefer. Each breakfast ranges from 228 to 368 calories while lunches span 384 to 407 calories. These ranges, particularly for lunches, are fairly similar so a simple swap should work for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What are the health impacts of visceral fat?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess visceral fat can increase the risk of metabolic syndrome, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and inflammation and liver disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_173-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re trying to lose visceral fat, reducing calories can help promote overall weight loss, which in turn can help reduce visceral fat. In addition to calorie reduction, here are some nutrition and lifestyle strategies that may help:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_174-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_175-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Protein&lt;/strong&gt;: Increasing total protein intake can help promote satiety and reduce visceral fat. In one study on men over 65 years old, research found that a higher protein intake of 1.3 grams of protein per kilograms body weight resulted in a greater reduction in visceral fat compared to participants who ate 0.8 grams of protein per kilograms body weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some good sources of protein include eggs, yogurt, kefir, cottage cheese, beans, nuts, fish, poultry, tofu and meat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill Up on Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Like protein, fiber is a nutrient that can promote satiety and reduce visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Studies link inulin, a type of soluble fiber, to be particularly effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sources of inulin are garlic, onion, artichokes, wheat, oats and legumes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Regularly&lt;/strong&gt;: Research shows that aerobic exercise, resistance training and a combination of both may all lead to reduced visceral fat. Though aerobic exercise appears to have the greatest impact, the best exercise is one you enjoy and can make part of your routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Enough Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorter, inadequate sleep of less than 5 ½ hours per night can lead to insulin resistance and increased visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re trying to lose visceral fat, aiming for around 8 hours of solid, quality sleep can be a helpful strategy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Canadian study shows that declining well-being in older age is not inevitable, as many older adults are able to bounce back to flourishing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost one in four adults aged 60 and older who first reported poor well-being were able to return to a state of optimal well-being within three years, according to research published on September 24, 2025, in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by University of Toronto researchers Mabel Ho and Esme Fuller-Thomson, underscores the benefits of healthy lifestyle choices such as maintaining a stable weight, avoiding smoking, staying physically active, addressing sleep difficulties, and managing chronic illnesses. It also points to the importance of nurturing psychological, emotional, and social health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers and policymakers are showing growing interest in what drives resilience and long-term well-being throughout life. While many lifestyle habits that can be adjusted play a role in protecting well-being—which encompasses physical, psychological, emotional, social, and self-perceived wellness, even in the presence of chronic disease—there is limited research on what helps older adults regain this level of health and fulfillment after experiencing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Study Design and Methods&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, Ho and Fuller-Thomson examined the characteristics of 8,332 older adults who did not meet the criteria for optimal well-being at baseline, and assessed them again three years later, when they were at least 60 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that nearly one-quarter of these individuals had regained optimal well-being over the three-year period. Respondents with baseline psychological and emotional wellness were most likely to regain optimal well-being: they were almost five times more likely to achieve optimal well-being by the end of the three-year period than were those who did not have psychological and emotional wellness at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_496093" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-496093" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-496093" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-777x784.jpg" alt="Conceptual Framework Used To Study Domains of Optimal Well Being" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-777x784.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-400x403.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-150x151.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-768x775.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-1523x1536.jpg 1523w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-450x454.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-1200x1210.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being-120x120.jpg 120w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Conceptual-Framework-Used-To-Study-Domains-of-Optimal-Well-Being.jpg 1957w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-496093" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A conceptual framework used to study physical, psychological and emotional, social and self-rated wellness domains of optimal well-being.

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of regaining optimal well-being was also higher among respondents who, at baseline, were younger (under 70 years old), were married, and had incomes above the poverty line. In terms of health characteristics, being physically active, non-smoking, not having sleeping problems, and not having chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, arthritis, or osteoporosis, were all associated with increased odds of regaining optimal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all Canadian citizens and permanent residents have free access to medically necessary services, the study’s findings may not fully apply to settings where patients must pay for healthcare services and so may experience reduced access to this help. It is also unclear if the findings can be generalized to low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implications for Policy and Practice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future research establishes that the associations observed in the current study are causal, policies and interventions that support physical, psychological, emotional, social, and self-rated wellness might help older adults to regain optimal well-being. For example, programs and services can be provided to encourage older adults to engage in an active and healthy lifestyle, to manage chronic conditions, and to prevent social isolation. According to the authors, these interventions might play an important role in enhancing older adults’ resilience and enabling them to regain optimal well-being in later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s powerful about this research is the reminder that later life can still be fulfilling, even after difficult periods. Good health is important, but so are the people, meaning, and joy we have in our lives,” says first author Mabel Ho, a recent doctoral graduate at the University of Toronto’s Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and the Institute of Life Course and Aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a clear call to invest in prevention, financial stability, and accessible wellness supports—because these aren’t just smart policies, they can potentially improve the trajectory of aging for older adults who are struggling,” says senior author Esme Fuller-Thomson, Director of the Institute for Life Course &amp;amp; Aging and Professor at the University of Toronto’s Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jeopardized efforts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the IFRC requested $25 million to contain the outbreak, but it has only $2.2 million in emergency funds for its outbreak response so far. The WHO likewise estimated the cost of responding to the outbreak over the next three months to be $20 million. But WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told the AP on Thursday that it only had $4.3 million in funding to draw from—a $2 million emergency fund and $2.3 million in funding from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Gavi vaccine alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without immediate support, gaps in operations will persist, jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities," Jasarevic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the US Agency for International Development, USAID, has provided critical support to respond to such outbreaks. But, with funding cuts and a dismantling of the agency by the Trump administration, the US is notably absent, and health officials fear it will be difficult to compensate for the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathias Mossoko, the Ebola Response Coordinator in Bulape, told the AP that the US has provided "some small support" but declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amitié Bukidi, chief medical officer of the Mweka health zone—another health zone in the Kasai province—told the outlet that there was still much work to do to contain the outbreak. "The need is still very great,” he said. “If USAID were to be involved, that would be good."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msXXyf2ZetI"&gt;Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/how-the-corruption-of-science-has-impacted-public-perception-and-policies-regarding-vaccines/"&gt;Sept. 9, 2025&lt;/a&gt;, on the corruption of science, witnesses presented an unpublished study that made a big assertion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They claimed that the study, soon to be featured in a highly publicized film called “An Inconvenient Study,” expected out in early October 2025, provides landmark evidence that vaccines raise the risk of chronic diseases in childhood.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in 2020 by researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.henryford.com/about"&gt;Henry Ford Health&lt;/a&gt;, a health care network in Detroit and southeast Michigan. Before the Sept. 9 hearing the study was not publicly available, but it became part of the public record after the hearing and is now &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Entered-into-hearing-record-Impact-of-Childhood-Vaccination-on-Short-and-Long-Term-Chronic-Health-Outcomes-in-Children-A-Birth-Cohort-Study.pdf"&gt;posted on the Senate committee website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the hearing, &lt;a href="https://www.sirillp.com/aaron-siri/"&gt;Aaron Siri&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer who &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/12/13/rfk-ally-revoke-polio-vaccine"&gt;specializes in vaccine lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; and acts as a legal adviser to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said the study was never published because the authors feared being fired for finding evidence supporting the health risks of vaccines. His rhetoric made the study sound definitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9286439"&gt;head of biostatistics&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, when I encounter new scientific claims, I always start with the question “Could this be true?” Then, I evaluate the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say definitively that the study by Henry Ford Health researchers has serious design problems that keep it from revealing much about whether vaccines affect children’s long-term health. In fact, a spokesperson at Henry Ford Health told journalists seeking comment on the study that it “was not published because it &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/vaccine-hearing-congress-illness-children#"&gt;did not meet the rigorous scientific standards&lt;/a&gt; we demand as a premier medical research institution.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study’s weaknesses illustrate several key principles of biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Study participants and conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the medical records of about 18,500 children born between 2000 and 2016 within the Henry Ford Health network. According to the records, roughly 16,500 children had received at least one vaccine and about 2,000 were completely unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors compared the two groups on a wide set of outcomes. These included conditions that affect the immune system, such as asthma, allergies and autoimmune disorders. They also included neurodevelopmental outcomes such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, autism and speech and seizure disorders, as well as learning, intellectual, behavioral and motor disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/portrait-of-smiling-students-hugging-in-classroom-royalty-free-image/699084039"&gt;Ariel Skelley/DigitalVision via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their headline result was that vaccinated children had 2.5 times the rate of “any selected chronic disease,” with 3 to 6 times higher rates for some specific conditions. They did not find that vaccinated children had higher rates of autism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study’s summary states it found that “vaccine exposure in children was associated with increased risk of developing a chronic health disorder.” That wording is strong, but it is not well supported given the weaknesses of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Timeline logic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study long-term diseases in children, it’s crucial to track their health until the ages when these problems usually show up. Many conditions in the study, like &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6776-asthma-in-children"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350889"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://childmind.org/article/early-signs-of-learning-challenges/"&gt;learning problems&lt;/a&gt; and behavior issues, are mostly diagnosed after age 5, once kids are in school. If kids are not followed that long, many cases will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that’s what happened here, especially for children in the unvaccinated group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25% of unvaccinated children in the study were tracked until they were less than 6 months old, 50% until they were less than 15 months old, and only 25% were tracked past age 3. That’s too short to catch most of these conditions. Vaccinated kids, however, were followed much longer, with 75% followed past 15 months of age, 50% past 2.7 years of age and 25% past 5.7 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer timeline gave the vaccinated kids many more chances to have diagnoses recorded in their Henry Ford medical records compared with the nonvaccinated group. The study includes no explanation for this difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one group is watched longer and into the ages when problems are usually found, they will almost always look sicker on paper, even if the real risks are the same. In statistics, this is called &lt;a href="https://healthjournalism.org/glossary-terms/surveillance-bias-detection-bias/"&gt;surveillance bias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary methods used in the paper were not sufficient to adjust for this surveillance bias. The authors tried new analyses using only kids followed beyond age 1, 3 or 5. But vaccinated kids were still tracked longer, with more reaching the ages when diagnoses are made, so those efforts did not fix this bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More opportunities to be diagnosed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all cases of chronic disease are written down in the Henry Ford records. Kids who go to a Henry Ford doctor more often get more checkups, more tests and more chances for their diseases to be found and recorded in the Henry Ford system. Increased doctor visits has been shown to increase the chance of diagnosing chronic conditions, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.09.028"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2023-325637"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-1023"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-14-16"&gt;developmental disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/1115/p628.html"&gt;learning disabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people in one group see doctors more often than people in another, those people may look like they have higher disease rates even if their true health is the same across both groups. In statistics, this is called &lt;a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/detection-bias/"&gt;detection bias&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Henry Ford system, vaccinated kids averaged about seven visits per year, while unvaccinated kids had only about two. That gave the vaccinated kids many more chances to be diagnosed. The authors tried leaving out kids with zero visits, but this did not fix the detection bias, since vaccinated kids still had far more visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the study doesn’t show which kids actually used Henry Ford for their main care. Many babies are seen at the hospital for birth and early visits, but then go elsewhere for routine care. If that happens, later diagnoses would not appear in the Henry Ford records. The short follow-up for many children suggests a lot may have left the system after infancy, hiding diagnoses made outside Henry Ford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apples and oranges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big differences between the groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated children can make it hard to know if vaccines really caused any differences in chronic disease. This is because of a &lt;a href="https://open.oregonstate.education/epidemiology/chapter/confounding/"&gt;statistical concept called confounding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two groups were not alike from birth. They differed in characteristics like sex, race, birth weight, being born early and the mother experiencing birth complications – all factors linked to later effects on health. The study made some adjustments for these, but left out many other important risks, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Whether families live in urban, suburban or rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Family income, health insurance and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Environmental exposures such as air and water pollution, which were concerns in Detroit at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Many factors can affect how often a child visits a health care provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors can affect both the chance of getting vaccinated and the chance of having health problems. They also change how often families visit Henry Ford clinics, which affects what shows up in the records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When too many measured and unmeasured differences line up, as they do here, the study is unable to fully separate cause from effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Henry Ford data could be helpful if the study followed both groups of kids to the same ages and took into account differences in health care use and background risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as written, the study’s main comparisons are tilted. The follow-up time was short and uneven, kids had unequal chances for diagnosis, and the two groups were very different in ways that matter. The methods used did not adequately fix these problems. Because of this, the differences reported in the study do not show that vaccines cause chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good science asks tough questions and uses methods strong enough to answer them. This study falls short, and it is being presented as stronger evidence than its design really allows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Men with the condition were found to report low self-esteem, feelings of helplessness, and significant strain in their intimate relationships. The findings highlight a psychosocial burden that has received limited scientific attention and suggest a need for more comprehensive care approaches for this patient group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-orgasmic illness syndrome is a rare disorder that causes a range of physical and mental symptoms following ejaculation. These symptoms often include fatigue, cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and muscle pain, and can last for days. The condition has mostly been reported in men, although some reports suggest it may also affect women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being documented for over two decades, the underlying causes of post-orgasmic illness syndrome remain unclear. Some researchers have proposed that it is an allergic or autoimmune reaction to semen, while others have suggested links to hormone imbalances, nerve dysfunction, or psychological factors. Until recently, much of the scientific work on this condition has focused on trying to understand its physical causes and to develop treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by Luke N. Maietta of the University of Massachusetts T.H. Chan Medical School, shifts focus to the emotional and social effects of living with this chronic condition. Maietta and his colleagues sought to explore how post-orgasmic illness syndrome affects self-perception, relationship dynamics, and feelings of social isolation. The researchers also aimed to create a framework for addressing the emotional and interpersonal struggles that patients may experience alongside their physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team collected data through online surveys completed by 83 male participants who either had a formal diagnosis of post-orgasmic illness syndrome or met all diagnostic criteria for the condition. These surveys were shared in online communities focused on the condition, including Reddit, Twitter, and POISCenter.com. Participants completed the Sexual Dysfunction Attribution Scale, a tool designed to measure how individuals understand the causes of their sexual difficulties and the effects those difficulties have on their emotional well-being and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study tended to be highly educated, with over 70 percent holding at least a bachelor’s degree, and came from predominantly middle- to upper-income backgrounds. Most were between the ages of 25 and 44, and about two-thirds were single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey results point to widespread emotional distress among men with post-orgasmic illness syndrome. Most participants believed that their symptoms were permanent and unchangeable. Specifically, 96 percent reported feeling that their symptoms would “always be present,” and over 80 percent said they had no control over their condition. A similar percentage believed that their partners also had no control over their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many participants internalized blame for their condition. About 60 percent said they deserved to be blamed for their sexual difficulties, while only 7 percent assigned blame to their partners. Most participants attributed their difficulties to their own physical or psychological makeup, with nearly 80 percent agreeing that something about them physically was causing their problems, and nearly half believing their difficulties were caused by something personal, such as their personality or mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sense of self-blame appeared to have consequences for participants’ intimate lives. Over 80 percent said their condition negatively affected their relationships. Roughly 37 percent said they had not had sex within the past year, which is higher than the typical rates for men in similar age groups in the general population. These findings suggest that people with post-orgasmic illness syndrome may avoid sexual activity out of fear of triggering symptoms or due to feelings of shame or inadequacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked about the stability and perceived causes of their symptoms. Most did not believe that outside factors like social pressure or lack of privacy were contributing to their condition. Nor did they believe that their partners were intentionally affecting their sexual functioning. Instead, respondents largely viewed their difficulties as being deeply rooted in themselves and resistant to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their study is descriptive in nature and does not include a comparison group of individuals without post-orgasmic illness syndrome. Because participants were recruited online through support communities, the sample may not represent all individuals with the condition. It is also possible that those who experience greater distress were more likely to respond to the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the measurement tool used—the Sexual Dysfunction Attribution Scale—was originally developed to assess sexual dysfunction in women. Although it was adapted for use in this study, it has not been formally validated for men with post-orgasmic illness syndrome. Future studies could refine the tool for broader use or develop a new assessment specifically tailored to this patient group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that future research should include more in-depth interviews or focus groups to explore how these psychosocial patterns play out in different contexts. There is also a need to study how partners are affected and whether interventions like counseling or support groups might improve outcomes for couples. Additionally, longitudinal studies could track how these psychological patterns change over time or in response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that mental health support should be considered an essential part of care for people living with post-orgasmic illness syndrome. Since most participants reported low levels of perceived control and high levels of personal blame, interventions aimed at increasing self-compassion and challenging distorted beliefs may be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-025-01103-9" target="_blank"&gt;Post-orgasmic illness syndrome and its effects on self esteem and relationships: a survey&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Luke N.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing sourdough can make bread more enjoyable and easier to digest thanks to its slow fermentation process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;True sourdough stands apart because fermentation lowers blood sugar impact, supports gut health, and partially breaks down gluten.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all loaves labeled “sourdough” are real—many use commercial yeast, so read labels to get full health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're getting a little 2020 déjà vu, you're not alone. Sourdough is having a moment. Again. Taylor Swift recently name-dropped her own starter, and a wave of loaves is popping up on TikTok. We've spied restaurants leaning into the trend, highlighting sourdough on their menus, and there's even a lot of wellness buzz around sourdough as people look to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-fermented-foods-for-gut-health-11792497" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermented foods for gut health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. It begs the question: Is sourdough better for you than other breads, or is it just really delicious and more fun to bake and brag about?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-sourdough-bread"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is Sourdough Bread? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At its simplest, sourdough is bread made from three ingredients: flour, water, and salt. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Its fermentation process, however, is the main thing that sets sourdough apart from other breads. Remember, nurturing bubbling jars of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-make-sourdough-starter-8547141" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sourdough starter&lt;/a&gt; in the early days of the pandemic? Well, that starter—a mixture of flour and water left to ferment, capturing wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria from the environment—gives sourdough its signature tang and chewy texture while helping the dough rise without the need for commercial yeast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Instead of using yeast, which gives a quick rise, sourdough is leavened, which is a slower fermentation process that uses a mix of wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. It can take anywhere between 12 and 24 hours for this to happen," explains registered dietitian Emer Delaney.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The result, when done properly, is a loaf that's crusty on the outside, tender on the inside, and depending on who you ask, possibly easier to digest than its counterparts.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutritionally, sourdough is somewhat similar to white, whole wheat, or multigrain bread if made from the same type of flour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Sourdough bread provides 319 calories per 100 g, which is more than white bread (238 calories), whole wheat bread (252 calories), and whole grain bread (265 calories),' explains registered dietitian Jennifer Pallian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also contains 13 g of protein, which is higher than white bread (10.7 g) and whole wheat (12.4 g), and nearly the same as whole grain (13.4 g), says Pallian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough has less fiber, with only 3.1 g, compared to white bread at 9.2 g, whole wheat at 6 g, and whole grain at 7.4 g. Its fat content is 2.14 g, very close to white bread, but lower than whole wheat (3.5 g) and whole grain (4.23 g)," explains Pallian.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The way sourdough is made gives it some unique qualities. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The fermentation process creates beneficial bacteria, or probiotics, that can support gut health. The fermentation can also produce food to help these healthy organisms grow, called prebiotics. This can benefit digestion. Through this fermentation process, the glycemic index is also lowered, causing less of a spike in blood sugar," says &lt;a href="https://yvettehill.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yvette Hill,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian nutritionist in Boulder County, Colorado. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Digestibility &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Where sourdough really stands out is in digestibility. The long fermentation process partially breaks down gluten and starches, which means your gut has less work to do to absorb and digest the bread. That said, it does not eliminate gluten.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Some people, particularly those with IBS, find sourdough easier to tolerate because of this fermentation process, but it doesn't eliminate gluten," says Hill. She explains that it is not advisable for anyone with celiac disease to eat sourdough. "Even though the fermentation changes the gluten proteins, it's still very much present and will trigger an autoimmune response for anyone who is celiac," she notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-beware-of-faux-sourdough"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Beware of Faux Sourdough &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all sourdoughs are created equal. Many supermarket loaves labeled "sourdough" are actually hybrids, as they use a touch of starter but rely heavily on commercial yeast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Some commercial 'sourdough' bread is produced with baker's yeast rather than true fermentation. This shortcut means the bread does not deliver the same nutritional or digestive benefits," explains Pallian. She suggests reading labels carefully and looking for breads made with whole grain flours and a clear mention of natural fermentation. True sourdough should include flour, water, salt, and a starter. If you see a commercial yeast listed in the ingredients, it's not a true sourdough.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-choose-the-best-sourdough"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How To Choose The Best Sourdough &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're choosing for health and flavor, a long-fermented sourdough made with whole grains is your best bet. "The longer fermentation method, the better. Anywhere between 12 and 24 hours will yield the best benefits," says Delaney.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough isn't a miracle food, but when made well, it is a flavorful, nourishing loaf that could outshine others.

For ages, the memory-mystery puzzled researchers, but now, a new research conducted at Boston University has shed light on this intriguing phenomenon. The study reveals that the brain prioritizes certain experiences based on their emotional significance and the process behind it, as scientists have named it, is ‘memory enhancement’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The research reveals that the brain selectively strengthens those memories that occur near emotionally significant events, and this process is known as memory enhancement. In other words, the brain uses emotional events to stabilize fragile memories, to make them more accessible in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research shows that emotional events trigger changes in brain activity, and as a result stabilize nearby fragile memories. The study revealed a principle called graded prioritization. As per the research, memories after an emotional event are strengthened depending on how powerful the event was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, memories before an event are rescued if they share similarities like matching color or themes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined
