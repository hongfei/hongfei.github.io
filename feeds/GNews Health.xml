&lt;p id="cc3d5357-9b42-4a00-89ea-e457bc11ab89"&gt;Most women already think about their hormonal health, with biological processes like the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the menopause having a big effect on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to biologist Dr Matt Kaeberlein, founder and CEO of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.optispan.life/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.optispan.life/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Optispan&lt;/a&gt;, a healthtech company dedicated to improving longevity, hormonal health is just as important for men—particularly middle-aged men. “A shockingly large number of men are dysregulated in terms of hormones when they get in their 50s,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="cc3d5357-9b42-4a00-89ea-e457bc11ab89-2"&gt;While precise figures aren’t available, Kaeberlein says that, “on average, men experience roughly a 30-50% decline in free testosterone between ages 30 and 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This degree of change is large enough to affect sexual function, metabolism, mood, cognitive performance and body composition in many men—although these changes often go unrecognized because they occur gradually and are commonly accepted as a ‘normal’ part of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein says that men who are thinking about their long-term health should be taking their hormones into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-why-should-middle-aged-men-care-about-their-hormones" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-should-middle-aged-men-care-about-their-hormones"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why should middle-aged men care about their hormones?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="6298043e-7e98-4048-aebe-084e190e99ab"&gt;“In the United States, especially for men, [hormone health] is not typically looked at unless the man asks for it,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, hormone health can play a key role in your quality of life and long-term health because of a gradual decline in testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LYBwtwsgHAAxgydP29PeES" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LYBwtwsgHAAxgydP29PeES slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For both men and women, testosterone in particular is going to be important for muscle mass,” says Kaeberlein. “Muscle mass is lost with age and loss of muscle mass drives, in particular, frailty and metabolic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people don’t realize that muscle is our primary way of buffering blood glucose, and so it’s a sink for blood glucose, and if you don’t have enough muscle, you’re at higher risk for metabolic disease and diabetes,” he continues. This is important for both men and women, but men generally lose muscle &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00625.2015?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00625.2015?utm_source=chatgpt.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;faster&lt;/a&gt; than women as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of testosterone can also have a significant impact on quality of life for middle-aged men. “Many men who are deficient in testosterone will experience a decline in energy, decline in libido, mood dysregulation and there are even mental health effects in some men,” says Kaeberlen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-test-for-testosterone-deficiency" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-test-for-testosterone-deficiency"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to test for testosterone deficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a5fb8078-19e5-4cea-9bc1-16697f8e3216"&gt;A simple blood test will provide you with information on your testosterone levels and whether you’re deficient, and this is a test Kaeberlein thinks every middle-aged person should do. “Everyone, in my view, who is in their 40s and 50s, should know what their hormonal status is,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-naturally-boost-your-testosterone"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to naturally boost your testosterone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="103f9da7-3195-42b7-a91f-09a3957a65ec"&gt;On the advice of medical professionals, some people supplement with testosterone using injections or patches, but Kaeberlein recommends looking at your lifestyle before considering this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You definitely can have an impact on testosterone through your lifestyle and my recommendation for most men would be, if you are deficient in testosterone, try [changing your] lifestyle first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two key lifestyle factors that can boost your testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-d0268df8-d0e5-479f-93d5-279276630663" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-diet-3"&gt;1. Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0134db22-f618-4f5f-95de-dab550197317"&gt;There are no specific foods that contain testosterone, but following a healthy, balanced diet can support your body's testosterone levels. “If you’re eating a crappy diet that’s high in simple sugars, high in processed foods, that can depress testosterone,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-379f9009-46b8-4a65-b42d-4ee464c28ee0" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-weight-training-3"&gt;2. Weight training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="43a4f8e6-2a57-4422-a0f5-2eb178e9545f"&gt;“Resistance training can boost testosterone in both men and women,” says Kaeberlein. That’s because resistance training, like lifting weights, creates muscle stress, which signals the body to produce more testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein stresses that following a healthy diet and lifting weights have plenty of health benefits, on top of boosting testosterone, so there’s absolutely no harm in trying them. “Regardless of whether you’re testosterone-deficient, you should be eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly anyway. But if boosting your testosterone is a motivating factor to get you to do it, that’s great!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a place to start with resistance training, we have an at-&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-strength-training-routine-at-home"&gt;home strength training routine for beginners&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-gym-machine-workout-plan" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/strength-workouts/beginner-gym-machine-workout-plan"&gt;beginner gym machine workout plan&lt;/a&gt; to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet sleep seems to get even more elusive with age.

A recent study found that long-term use of sleeping pills among older adults with insomnia was linked to poorer sleep quality—even worse than in those who had insomnia but didn’t take the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Aids Cause Poor Quality of Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/10/zsaf168/8164643" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt; journal found that older adults who regularly used prescription sleep aids had less deep, restorative sleep, compared to those who don’t take the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scnlab.com/team/thien-thanh-dang-vu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Thanh Dang-Vu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Thanh Dang-Vu&lt;/a&gt;, the lead author of the study and director of the Sleep, Cognition &amp;amp; Neuroimaging Laboratory at Concordia University, told &lt;em&gt;Nifty 50+&lt;/em&gt; that chronic use of commonly prescribed sleeping pills “does not provide benefits in terms of sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that their use “is not only risky but also worsens sleep quality—in particular by affecting aspects of sleep that are important for brain health and memory consolidation.” Dang-Vu is also a neurologist and researcher at the Montreal Geriatric University Institute (IUGM) and vice president of research for the Canadian Sleep Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep, also called slow-wave sleep, is when heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure drop and the body releases hormones that repair tissues and strengthen bones. It’s also the stage when the body and brain do most of their overnight repair work. During this stage of sleep, the brain consolidates memories, transferring them from short- to long-term storage by allowing the hippocampus (the brain’s memory hub) to communicate efficiently with the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave sleep is especially sensitive to sleep loss. And when older adults get less of this deep, restorative sleep, it can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12168795/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:make memory and thinking problems worse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;make memory and thinking problems worse&lt;/a&gt; as the connection between the hippocampus and neocortex weakens, making it harder for the brain to organize and hold onto new information. This, in turn, may accelerate age-related memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Concordia University in Canada followed 101 older adults divided into three groups: good sleepers, those with insomnia who didn’t use sleep aids, and those with insomnia who used them chronically (three or more times a week for over three months). Participants underwent overnight polysomnography, which records physiological functions during sleep, including brain waves, breathing, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem With Sleeping Aids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many older adults, a pill at bedtime can seem like the simplest fix, but long-term use comes with a cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benzodiazepines and similar medications are considered safe and effective for brief use (no longer than two to four weeks), such as for jet lag or temporary stress. They work by enhancing the effect of a brain chemical that slows brain activity and produces a calming, sleep-inducing effect. However, clinical guidelines recommend that older adults &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.18372" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid them entirely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avoid them entirely&lt;/a&gt; because of their potential risks like confusion, dizziness, fainting, falls, and hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults are especially vulnerable since their bodies process these drugs more slowly and their brains are &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.18372" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more sensitive to their effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more sensitive to their effects&lt;/a&gt;, which makes &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811211069096" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:side effects stronger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;side effects stronger&lt;/a&gt; and longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications are also considered second-line treatments because they don’t address the underlying cause of poor sleep. And importantly, benzodiazepines aren’t meant for long-term use because they’re highly addictive. Over time, users may need higher doses to achieve the same effect, leading to dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/31739/chapter-abstract/265577251" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:even at normal or low doses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;even at normal or low doses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1064748121001226" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Symptoms may include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Symptoms may include&lt;/a&gt; anxiety, irritability, fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal problems, and in rare cases, seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks are compounded in older adults, whose cognitive functions like memory and processing speed naturally decline with age. Research shows that benzodiazepines can further impair these abilities, amplifying the cognitive effects of aging. People who regularly use sleep medications are also about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7925354/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:30% more likely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;30% more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia than those who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic use doesn’t just carry long-term risks—it may also undermine the very sleep it’s meant to help. Dang-Vu explained that chronic use of sleeping pills leads to shallow and less restorative sleep. “People using these pills may not feel refreshed when they wake up from their sleep, and may be less able to remember new information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults taking them may work with their doctors to gradually taper off the drug while beginning a cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) program, which has been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01847-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve sleep quality and reduce insomnia symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve sleep quality and reduce insomnia symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in older adults. Sleep struggles are common in later life, and it’s understandable to want quick relief.

Instead keep it simple and maybe write a number from one to 10 to summarise the impact it had on your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's also useful to track how many crystal-clear days you have, not just the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Your doctor can then review it to help identify patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;2.

			&lt;p&gt;Oral hygiene has been linked to multiple health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-surprising-link-between-oral-health-and-your-brain"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gum-disease-isnt-only-a-problem-for-your-mouth-heres-what-to-know"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Now, research shows that people with both gum disease and more tooth cavities also have a notably higher risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-tooth-loss-linked-to-risk-of-fatal-heart-disease-study-finds"&gt;have been individually associated with&lt;/a&gt; stroke in the past, but few studies have analyzed the conditions in combination. So a study led by a team from the University of South Carolina restricted their investigation to individuals with cases of periodontal disease and dental caries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that people with both cavities and gum disease had almost twice the risk of stroke when compared to people with good oral health, even after controlling for cardiovascular risk factors," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5290"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Souvik Sen, the chair of the neurology department at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-popular-diet-seems-to-reduce-gum-disease-scientists-say"&gt;This Popular Diet Seems to Reduce Gum Disease, Scientists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 5,986 adults with an average age of 63, with no prior &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/strokes-are-rising-among-under-55s-do-you-know-what-to-look-for"&gt;history of ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; (caused by clots), coronary heart disease, or cavities without a history of gum disease, whose health was tracked for an average of 21 years. Their oral health was then charted against major cardiovascular events, including &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/ischemic-stroke-clots"&gt;ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180261" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/StrokeChart.jpg" alt="Stroke chart" class="wp-image-180261 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/StrokeChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/StrokeChart-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180261" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Worse oral health was associated with a greater risk of stroke. (Wood et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurol. Open Access&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dividing the participants into three groups based on good oral health, gum disease only, or gum disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-your-teeth-could-be-a-deadly-warning-study-finds"&gt;and cavities&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found just 4.1 percent of those with good oral health had experienced a stroke event in the past. Among those who just had gum disease, the figure jumped to 6.9 percent. In the gum disease and cavities group, the incidence was 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once common contributing factors such as body mass index and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/quitting-smoking-even-at-75-can-increase-life-expectancy-study-finds"&gt;smoking status&lt;/a&gt; were factored in, the final calculations showed that those with gum disease had a 44 percent increased risk of stroke than those with healthy mouths. Those with both gum disease and cavities had an 86 percent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study's results only describe an association, the researchers can only speculate why the link exists. However, studies suggest that inflammation and bacteria from the mouth can spread to other areas of the body, worsening &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; and increasing the likelihood of clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an idea that's been explored in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; too, which have found oral bacteria in the plaques that can build up and put pressure on the arteries – potentially leading to the formation of clots and triggering of ischemic strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that improving oral health may be an important part of stroke prevention efforts," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5290"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, people with both gum disease and cavities had a 36 percent higher risk of major cardiovascular events – including strokes, fatal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, or fatal heart attacks – than those classed as having healthy mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also confirm the benefits of routine checkups: those who reported visiting the dentist regularly were 81 percent less likely to have both gum disease and cavities together, and 29 percent less likely to have gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the idea that taking care of your teeth and gums isn't just about your smile," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5290"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sen.

It's not a trivial condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;With the right support, she said people with ADHD can thrive,  but there were "high, high risks" that without that support, people's conditions can become much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This, she said, can include mental health problems, substance misuse, unemployment and getting in trouble with the criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And Dr Jessica Eccles, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said services were having to make difficult decisions because "rising demand was outstripping capacity" in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There are unacceptably long waiting lists," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Diagnosis transformed my life'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Sam's life has been transformed by getting his ADHD diagnosis &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients who have received support say it has transformed their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sam Stone is an example of that, but he had to battle to get help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The 33-year-old, who lives near Gloucester, paid for a private diagnosis on his health insurance, but his GP wouldn't accept it and he had to go back on an NHS waiting list to get it confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He is angry at how complicated the system is.

&lt;p&gt;In the end, his combination of rash, malaise, liver and kidney problems, facial paralysis, and swelling all fit with syphilis. However, syphilis that affects the liver is rare, occurring in less than 10 percent of cases, which made the diagnosis particularly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors think the infection was likely in the second stage. In the first stage, people just develop a chancre at the site of the infection. The chancre develops usually around a month after an exposure, is painless, and resolves on its own. Then the second stage emerges with the bacterial infection going systemic, usually with rash, malaise, loss of appetite, joint pain, swelling, fevers, and sore throat—similar to the man’s symptoms. After that, the infection can become latent (third stage) before reemerging in the tertiary (late stage), which can manifest in various ways, including with the destruction of the heart, central nervous system, and organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While late-stage syphilis can show up years or even decades after an initial infection, the secondary stage doesn’t, the doctors note. “Secondary syphilis typically emerges within the first year after untreated primary infection and only rarely beyond 4 years,” they wrote in the report. It’s possible an immunosuppressing drug, like the steroid he took for his facial paralysis, could reactivate a latent infection, but once reactivated, it would be a late-stage infection, not a secondary one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the man’s STI history decades ago led the doctors to the right diagnosis, it doesn’t explain the current infection. A “more recent, unreported exposure must be considered,” the doctors wrote, but, ultimately, the timing and source of the infection remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a treatment of antibiotics, the man made a full recovery. His doctors note that local health authorities would be contacted to track down and notify the man’s actual sexual partners. How things went with the man’s wife also remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers discovered that trauma increases activity in calcium channels within a neural circuit connecting the nucleus reuniens and hippocampus, amplifying pain processing and impulsive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hyperactivation predisposes individuals to both self-injury and aggressive outbursts later in life. The findings offer the first mechanistic explanation linking trauma, pain sensitivity, and maladaptive behavior—opening doors for more precise treatments for trauma-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Circuit:&lt;/strong&gt; Early trauma overactivates a brain pathway linking the nucleus reuniens and hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium Channel Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased calcium channel activity drives susceptibility to both aggression and self-harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Connection:&lt;/strong&gt; Emotional and physical pain appear to act as gateways to these behaviors through altered brain signaling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggression and self-harm often co-occur in individuals with a history of early-life trauma&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;a connection that has largely been documented by self-reporting in research and clinical settings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this connection, individuals treated for self-inflicted injuries are five times more likely to engage in excessive aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s happening in the brain to tie these two behaviors together? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by Sora Shin, an assistant professor in the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC’s Center for Neurobiology Research, has identified a brain circuit that changes after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published Nov. 5 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that aggression and self-harm may appear to be very different behaviors, but actually, they could share a common neural basis,” Shin said. “Both may exist along a continuum rooted in how the brain processes pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shin and her team investigate how childhood adversity leads to changes in the brain that result in maladaptive adult behaviors. Her previous research examined how early trauma contributes to binge eating later in life and how stress influences emotional eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had long wondered about causes of aggression and self-harm. Is it anxiety or depression? Or could something deeper — perhaps the way the brain processes pain — be at the core?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice models, Shin found that both early-life trauma and overactivity of a specific calcium channel in neurons along the brain pathway linking the nucleus reuniens and the hippocampus increase the risk of impulsive aggression and self-injurious behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus reuniens connects the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus and is involved in memory, emotion, and decision-making. Dysregulation of this region has been implicated in impulsivity and anxiety-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Shin identified specific calcium channels within this pathway that are critical to the development of aggression and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trauma actually increased the channel activity,” said Shin, who also holds an appointment in Virginia Tech’s Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s changed the brain and molecular properties and caused hyperactivation of the neuron. Excessive activity in that circuit increases susceptibility to aggression and self-harm.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found that pain, including emotional pain, may serve as a gateway for these behaviors to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying the neurological connection between early trauma and its impacts, the study offers a deeper understanding that goes beyond the subjective, self-reported assessments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aggression, especially pathological aggression, is a critical social problem that can have serious consequences in our society,” Shin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Self-harm is also a pressing concern across many clinical populations. Our study provides more open, active insights about the neural circuit basis that underlies these outcomes and may ultimately guide the development of more effective therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Shin’s work epitomizes the power of combining ground-breaking technological innovation with conceptual advances to address health challenges that not only have tremendous impact on individual’s personal lives but society at large,” said Michael Friedlander, the executive director of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and Virginia Tech’s vice president for Health Sciences and Technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Shin’s research was funded by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, part of the National Institutes of Health. The work was also supported by the FBRI Seale Innovation fund, the Integrated Translational Health Research Institute of Virginia, and a postdoctoral fellowship from the South Korean government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors on the paper include Jane Jung, postdoctoral associate in Shin’s lab, and former research associate In-Jee You.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762376997878"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What connection did researchers find between aggression and self-harm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Both behaviors appear to share a common neural pathway that becomes overactive after early-life trauma, suggesting they stem from similar disruptions in how the brain processes pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762376999410"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Which brain circuit is involved in aggression and self-harm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The study identified a pathway between the nucleus reuniens and the hippocampus—key regions for emotion, memory, and decision-making—where trauma heightens calcium channel activity in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762376999287"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is this discovery about aggression and self-harm important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: By pinpointing the neurobiological roots of aggression and self-harm, researchers can move beyond self-reported data to develop targeted therapies that address the underlying brain dysfunction caused by trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this trauma, aggression, and self-harm research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#87ede3f7e6f4f3e8f5c7f1f3a9e2e3f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;John Pastor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;John Pastor – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ady5540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thalamo-hippocampal pathway determines aggression and self-harm&lt;/a&gt;” by Sora Shin et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thalamo-hippocampal pathway determines aggression and self-harm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggression and self-harm are maladaptive coping strategies that often occur in individuals with a history of early life trauma (ELT), yet their underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify L-type calcium channel (LTCC)–expressing thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) as a critical component regulating both behaviors. ELT-induced excessive LTCC activity in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) RE neurons and its corresponding effects on persistent neuronal activation contribute to increasing susceptibility to aggression and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activation of vGlut2 RE neurons projecting to ventral hippocampus (vCA1), but not medial prefrontal cortex, promotes these behaviors in control mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we found that RE neurons modulate two distinct subsets of vCA1 neurons, with one projecting to the hypothalamus to drive aggression and another to the basal amygdala to mediate self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings uncover how LTCC functions in the RE-to-vCA1 neural pathway increase the risk of aggression and self-harm, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating destructive behaviors following early adversity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 21:14:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9UZHdxT3V2TG5NeHVxUE02VENTaGt5ZzhXcm5iRVI4b29BVU50VklmTTJUcTg3ZXdvMGF2SEFnbzRiejBBelFXandVMDRJRkN6WkpZaVNJTHFlOWk2SkVyRTFnUVJTaDFKVHlYUllua1k</guid></item><item><title>重度饮酒者较早发生中风，研究表明-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/well/alcohol-drinking-strokes-brain-bleeds.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 21:00:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQZXpOeHNza2VmOUl2c21XR0F3S01yTWFlaHNhTktUeXVmY1NlbElXb3QweENNcHk2MWFtZGFPbDhEbF83NFI5UFBFR3BfU19rOEhkVmpxMmZhUzMzenBBeGJHYXRTNy1Qc3BjRl9qWW9LVndiUzNiZklqY1kxQmY4VURKOHhta1NMV2c</guid></item><item><title>阿尔茨海默氏症和大脑意识：在降低痴呆风险方面发挥领导作用- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51399739/alzheimers-and-brain-awareness-leading-the-charge-in-reducing-dementia-risk</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;November is Alzheimer's Awareness Month and as the global population ages, the urgency to address cognitive decline and its associated risks has never been greater. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, affects over 7 million Americans aged 65 and older, with projections estimating nearly 13 million cases by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Keith Darrow, Ph.D., a Harvard Medical and MIT-trained neuroscientist and clinical audiologist, and his team at &lt;a href="https://www.hearingandbraincenters.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Hearing and Brain Centers of America&lt;/a&gt; have partnered with &lt;a href="https://preventingdecline.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;PreventingDecline.com&lt;/a&gt; to combat this growing epidemic by offering a &lt;a href="https://braincarehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Free Brain Care Score&lt;/a&gt; and a comprehensive Dementia Risk Reduction Library to seniors nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By visiting &lt;a href="https://braincarehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;BrainCareHealth.com&lt;/a&gt;, seniors can request an appointment to assess their brain health and access critical resources and treatments to reduce their dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The intersection of hearing health and cognitive decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darrow, the driving force behind the Excellence in Audiology movement, has dedicated his career to bridging the gap between hearing health and cognitive well-being. His research highlights a critical, yet often overlooked, risk factor for dementia: untreated hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institute on Aging, hearing loss is one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline, with studies showing that individuals with moderate hearing loss are twice as likely to develop dementia, and those with severe hearing loss face a fivefold increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection is particularly alarming given that nearly 50 million Americans suffer from hearing loss, and 1.5 billion people worldwide experience tinnitus, a condition often linked to progressive degenerative disorders that may signal early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darrow's work emphasizes that hearing loss is not merely an inconvenience, but a serious public health issue that impacts brain function. The brain relies on auditory input to maintain cognitive sharpness, and untreated hearing loss can lead to social isolation, reduced mental stimulation, and accelerated cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hearing loss is the number one modifiable mid-life risk factor for preventing dementia," Darrow explains. "By addressing hearing health early, we can significantly reduce the risk of cognitive decline and improve quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His vision is to empower seniors to take proactive steps toward brain health, and his innovative approach is transforming the field of audiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Raising awareness through the free brain care score&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing and Brain Centers of America are raising the bar for community outreach by offering a free brain care score to all seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique assessment, available by requesting an appointment through &lt;a href="https://braincarehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;BrainCareHealth.com&lt;/a&gt; or calling (435) 253-6243, provides a personalized evaluation of an individual's hearing health and a cognitive screening with actionable next steps. The evaluation is designed to identify early risk factors of cognitive decline and dementia, assess their potential impact on cognitive function and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate risks and live your best life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This initiative is particularly timely, as early detection and intervention are critical in managing dementia risk. The Alzheimer's Association notes that up to 45% of dementia cases may be attributable to modifiable risk factors, such as hearing loss, high blood pressure, and lack of physical activity. By offering the free brain care score, Darrow and his team are addressing one of the most actionable of these factors: ensuring that seniors have access to the tools and health education they need to protect their cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Dementia Risk Reduction Library: Empowering seniors with knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the free brain care score, Hearing and Brain Centers are providing seniors with access to a comprehensive Dementia Risk Reduction Library, available upon requesting an appointment at BrainCareHealth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This curated collection of resources, developed by Darrow and his team, includes evidence-based information on all 14 modifiable mid-life risk factors for Dementia; including his best-selling book:  &lt;a href="https://hbcabookoffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;"Preventing Decline:  Advances in the Medical Treatment of Hearing Loss and Tinnitus"&lt;/a&gt; as well as practical strategies in social engagement, physical activity, and nutrition for reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dementia Risk Reduction Library draws heavily from Darrow's Amazon best-selling books, "Preventing Decline: Advances in the Medical Treatment of Hearing Loss and Tinnitus" and "Stop Living in Isolation." These books offer an in-depth exploration of how modern hearing treatments can enhance brain function, improve quality of life, and potentially slow the progression of dementia. The library also includes articles, videos, and podcasts where Darrow and leading wellness experts share science-backed tools for active aging and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the library's key messages is the importance of early intervention. According to the National Institute of Health, &lt;a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/brain-detected-20-years-alzheimers-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;brain changes associated with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; can begin 20 years before symptoms appear, underscoring the need for proactive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dementia Risk Reduction Library equips seniors with practical steps, such as adopting a heart-healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and seeking treatment for hearing loss, all of which can significantly lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Darrow: A visionary in audiology and dementia research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darrow's contributions to audiology and dementia research are nothing short of revolutionary. As the only Harvard Medical and MIT-trained neuroscientist in private practice audiology, he brings a unique perspective to the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research, cited over 1,050 times, has advanced understanding of the neurological implications of hearing loss and its role in cognitive decline. His leadership of the Excellence in Audiology movement has inspired over 1,296 audiologists and hearing specialists from eight countries to prioritize brain health in their practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darrow's commitment to patient care is equally remarkable. His clinics, recognized as among the fastest-growing audiology practices in North America by Inc. 500|5000, have served over 27,000 community members and educated more than 162,000 individuals through national speaking tours. What sets his practice apart is its patient-centered approach, modeled after the Disney Institute and Ritz Carlton's service standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Hearing and Brain Centers of America&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's our people, our culture, and our commitment to do whatever it takes to serve the best interests of our patients and their families," Darrow says. This includes offering affordable monthly treatment plans and referring patients to nonprofit foundations when cost is a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A call to action for Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Alzheimer's Awareness Month unfolds, Darrow and Hearing and Brain Centers are calling on seniors and their families to take charge of their brain health. The free brain care score and Dementia Risk Reduction Library are powerful tools designed to empower individuals with knowledge and actionable steps. By visiting &lt;a href="https://braincarehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;BrainCareHealth.com&lt;/a&gt;, seniors can schedule their free assessment and access a wealth of resources to protect their cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high. Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and its economic impact is staggering, with care costs projected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2050. Yet, as Darrow's work demonstrates, there is hope. By addressing hearing loss and other modifiable risk factors, individuals can significantly reduce their dementia risk and enhance their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information or to schedule your Free Brain Care Score, visit &lt;a href="https://braincarehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;BrainCareHealth.com&lt;/a&gt; today.

        &lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old Filipino woman may have one of the weirdest real-life superpowers in the world. In a recent case report, doctors describe how the woman’s armpits are able to produce breast milk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dermatologists at the University of the Philippines &lt;a href="https://www.jaadcasereports.org/article/S2352-5126%2825%2900253-X/fulltext"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the unusual medical marvel earlier this fall in the journal JAAD Case Reports. The woman’s milky armpits are the result of being born with extra breast tissue on both sides of her underarms. Despite some added hassle following her pregnancies, however, the added breasts don’t seem to be harming her health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An “uncommon entity”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the report, the woman first began to notice something was different about her armpits 15 years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immediately after her first pregnancy, her armpits began to swell up and produce “milky secretions from the overlying hair follicles.” The phenomenon disappeared once she weaned her child away from breastfeeding but returned after each successive pregnancy, which prompted her latest visit to the doctors. She didn’t experience any other concerning trouble, such as redness, but the “engorgement” of her armpits did seem to get worse with each child she had.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The doctors determined that her armpits contained ectopic breast tissue—”ectopic” meaning the presence of a body part where it normally shouldn’t be. The condition is present since birth but typically goes unnoticed until the same hormonal changes that affect normal breast tissue, such as puberty or pregnancy, can affect it, too. Usually, as in this case, the extra breasts aren’t accompanied by areolas or nipples.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As you might expect, having an extra breast or two is an exceptionally rare condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ectopic breast tissue is an uncommon entity,” the doctors wrote, noting it’s only found in around 2% to 6% of women and 1% to 3% of men. Most cases are sporadic, or happen randomly, but about 6% are tied to inherited genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Watchful monitoring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is some evidence to suggest that ectopic breast tissue is more likely to become cancerous than usual, according to the doctors. Notwithstanding that possibility, the tissue can still develop the same problems that can plague a normal breast, such as mastitis (an inflamed mammary gland). But the doctors’ tests found no reasons to be concerned for the time being. And since her armpits have gone back to normal every time after she stopped breastfeeding, she decided to not seek the removal of her tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The doctors did recommend that she regularly have follow-up visits to keep an eye on her armpits, along with her routine breast cancer screenings. “Proper work-up is prudent due to its potential for developing benign and malignant breast conditions,” they wrote. “Management is conservative unless symptomatic and with cosmetic concerns.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On one hand, I can imagine how weird it would be to have your armpits suddenly lactating for no apparent reason. But on the other, that’d be one hell of a parlor trick to bust out at my next party.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9ttf9003g3b79axmoggzu@published"&gt;Is it possible that masturbation killed the nerve cells in my penis? I’m 53, but as a teen, I often masturbated by dry humping a pillow. I recently came across a video that showed a man being orally teased on his frenulum and how sensitive it is. Mine isn’t. Could I have done some damage to myself? And if so, are there any remedies?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9ttfa003j3b790uuivkl1@published"&gt;It is highly unlikely that your masturbation style caused nerve damage, according to my go-to urology source, Dr. Charles Welliver, director of men’s health in the department of urology at Albany Medical College. “Penile sensation does decrease with age, so might be some age-related changes,” he added in an email regarding your question. This just may be where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9ttfa003k3b79jpqfi7fb@published"&gt;To interrogate your suspicion of nerve damage, consider whether you are experiencing any &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15833-neuropathic-pain"&gt;symptoms of neuropathic pain&lt;/a&gt;, like stabbing, numbness, or tingling. Is your penis sensitive to touch? Are you experiencing unexpected sensations (outside of the context of sex/masturbation)? You don’t report any of these, just the suspicion that you could be feeling more than you are. For what is likely a variety of reasons, often in concert with one another, some dicks are more sensitive to stimulation than others are. Some guys can’t keep their load in when a mouth is wrapped around them; others never come from receiving head. Some love having their glans and frenulum played with; others are all about the shaft. There are too many variables to pinpoint exactly why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9ttfb003l3b79ewbrkthd@published"&gt;Generally, issues related to decreased sensation through masturbation are not the result of damaged nerves, but what sex therapist Michael Perelman has deemed “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5001992/"&gt;idiosyncratic masturbatory style&lt;/a&gt;.” As Ian Kerner, also a sex therapist, explains in his book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tell-About-Last-Time-You-ebook/dp/B08F51RY43/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hR9a_NCI8xoWbatCXqXEub-rPG2FjVc9ZAfm3SdF_gLcC1jffHQ8LfrOzjMkMISFwm5d5AJGMRjRVNiaLYeSwsAjKrP9wN_drAUGl8WQLSYzs-ecDv1csSjLHmT_6yY5x5YFjCSPVWaBlQDxdXTIUTCigd4yG9XdiAMe6kvWj66XWlNyhTXcIDk3-TC3MD7b6T2u0dnnjbfecmEiTUj-sBekY2sZLerMV6BLPvgyucg.Vf9X0MIbNrUiyh8mtYuuvFfUs1yzmAS3QXdNd5iWmzU&amp;amp;qid=1762037396&amp;amp;sr=8-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;So Tell Me About the Last Time You Had Sex: Laying Bare and Learning to Repair Our Love Lives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, a person with a penis can get used to a degree of pressure and friction on the penis during masturbation that isn’t precisely replicable during partnered sex, so it can become harder to achieve the momentum necessary to reach the point of ejaculatory inevitability. Solution: take a short masturbation break and/or masturbate with your non-dominant hand—if you’re right-handed, start masturbating with your left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9u57m003u3b79it26avds@published"&gt;It sounds like you discontinued this way of masturbating decades ago. At this point, are you deriving enjoyment out of sex/masturbation? I’m not talking about some hypothetically optimized version of sexual pleasure where it feels like lightning is shooting out of your frenulum when the wind blows its way. I mean: Does it still feel good? Are you orgasming? Does touching yourself make you want to keep touching yourself? If so, you’re probably fine. Get pleasure where you can find it and try to stop looking to others to (in)validate it.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a great relationship and are very much in love, but he suffers from depression. When he is in a depressive episode, he doesn’t want to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;

I know it’s not about me, it’s something he has to deal with internally, and we discuss it together often, but sometimes it’s hard to act like I don’t have needs. I don’t want to make the guilt worse because I understand that he is struggling, but I also experience sexual frustration when we go weeks at a time without it.&lt;/p&gt;

I told him I’m open to doing anything I can to help him, but that he has to be willing to put in the effort. Do you have any suggestions for how we can work through this together? I’m struggling with how to approach the issue in a way that is productive and doesn’t make him feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9uono00493b79cn8yqel4@published"&gt;Therapy would be a good first stop. You could look into couples counseling. That would allow you to take an active role in finding the counselor and holding your boyfriend accountable for showing up. Individual therapy and perhaps a psychiatrist (in the event that medication would be beneficial, and for someone who has battled depression most of his life, it very well could be) would probably be ideal for him, but maybe couples counseling gets him in the door and used to the therapeutic process. Individual issues tend to come out during couples therapy, so it could be that your therapist assesses the situation and encourages him to seek therapy separately. That could give him even more of an impetus to find help for himself. Therapy can certainly be expensive, but hopefully you two have insurance, which will cut down the cost considerably if performed by an in-network clinician (which, keep in mind, isn’t necessarily &lt;a href="https://www.thecouplescenter.org/does-insurance-cover-couples-therapy/"&gt;always true of couples counseling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9uono004a3b799q8gt0wx@published"&gt;Otherwise, you should be as patient as possible. It’s OK to talk about your needs, but at this point, you know exactly what to expect. You know that when he’s in a depressive state, sex is off the table. This may be frustrating, but as things stand, there is virtually nothing that can be done at those times. Forcing the issue or attempting to have him push through so you can get laid is likely to backfire. If he is amenable to it, maybe you can ask for whatever level of affection he is comfortable with during his depressive moments—cuddling, kissing, holding hands, etc. It’s not going to replace sex, and it might not even scratch your itch, but staying physically connected can help maintain intimacy in the absence of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

It would be a way for you to get sex when he can’t provide, but I’d start that process, if it’s what you want, with the help of a therapist, given how sensitive the situation is. If nothing else, hopefully you can use masturbation to tide yourself over when your boyfriend isn’t in the mood. If you haven’t explored toys to use on yourself but think that could be something you’re into, now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9uonq004g3b793y3sbbw7@published"&gt;I think the issue is less about whether or not something is going on behind her back—there is, it involves you masturbating with a Fleshlight—and more about whether this constitutes cheating or if it’s her business at all, for that matter. In my opinion, it doesn’t and it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9uonq004h3b79amkt07ud@published"&gt;If your wife hadn’t specified previously that she has an issue with you using a Fleshlight/masturbating, she has sprung new rules on you that you had no reason to assume were in place. It is healthy and prosocial to respect one’s partner’s masturbation habits. Of course, if these habits get in the way of partnered sex or are assisted unethically, a conversation or even intervention may be appropriate. But it doesn’t sound like that’s what’s happening at all. It sounds like your wife found your sex toy and got upset about it. Maybe she’s upset that you masturbate, period, and as an external manifestation of your solo sex life, the Fleshlight shouldered the blame. Either way, there’s not much logic there. As an outlet that you turn to in the absence of sex with your wife, the toy is a method of preventing actual cheating. Some people &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt; their partner would just stick to sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="172" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9uonq004i3b79t1lexe6x@published"&gt;I would ask her what she expects you to do when you want sex and she doesn’t. Taking care of it yourself, by yourself, seems like the most reasonable and ethical method of doing this. Surely, you wouldn’t want to pester her or make her feel bad. You should assure her that the issue isn’t really about her not being enough, but that you are two different people with different sex drives. Maybe she has ideas for ways to get her in the mood when she isn’t (if her &lt;a href="https://www.issm.info/sexual-health-qa/what-is-responsive-sexual-desire"&gt;desire is more responsive&lt;/a&gt;, this could be very useful). She might want to up the frequency of sex based on the knowledge that she now has. I wouldn’t allow her to have all of the control here—you are entitled to masturbation, and there is nothing wrong with sex toys. But this may be an opportunity to change things in your shared sex life, which may result in something that is even more mutually satisfying. Try to use this as a moment for bonding.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, aging appears to reprogram T cells — important immune cells that help train a type of white blood cell, called B cells, to produce &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibodies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in response to viruses and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7f8af8e1-9aaf-45af-bc76-f8a69cd5a828"&gt;The findings, published Oct. 29 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_2826053089882454976&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09686-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Faging-and-inflammation-may-not-go-hand-in-hand-study-suggests" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09686-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09686-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Faging-and-inflammation-may-not-go-hand-in-hand-study-suggests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest that inflammation may not be as fundamental to the aging process as scientists previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think inflammation is driven by something independent from just the age of a person," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://alleninstitute.org/person/claire-gustafson/" target="_blank" data-url="https://alleninstitute.org/person/claire-gustafson/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Claire Gustafson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant investigator at the Allen Institute for Immunology and one of the lead authors of the study, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://alleninstitute.org/news/how-age-affects-vaccine-responses-and-how-to-make-them-better/" target="_blank" data-url="https://alleninstitute.org/news/how-age-affects-vaccine-responses-and-how-to-make-them-better/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/alan-cohen-phd" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/alan-cohen-phd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alan Cohen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University who studies aging and inflammation, said the new findings support a more nuanced view of "inflammaging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that inflammation increases with age "may be true on average in industrialized populations," said Cohen, who was not involved in the work. "But it won't be true for everyone, and it won't be true in every population," he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k2oyHney9mpKF7kpYQeEwX" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k2oyHney9mpKF7kpYQeEwX slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen cautioned that the participants in the new study were drawn entirely from Palo Alto, California, and Seattle — both highly industrialized areas.

"I would take it more as, here's an example of a population that doesn't appear to be doing the same things that we have typically expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-727f855c-fa46-46f9-9e25-31caa6dfd3a8" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="t-cell-changes-are-not-driven-by-inflammation-3"&gt;T cell changes are not driven by inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="434189e4-2a05-433e-9805-8062fccf0db8"&gt;In the interest of improving older adults' responses to vaccines, Gustafson and her colleagues looked at how T cells change with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they compared younger adults (ages 25 to 35) with an older group (ages 55 to 65, or people at what the researchers call the "cusp of aging.") For two years, the researchers followed 96 healthy volunteers in these age groups, collecting blood samples from each participant eight to 10 times and monitoring their immune systems before and after their annual flu vaccinations. Then, they expanded their research to include a second group of 234 adults ranging in age from 40 to over 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the immune system across these groups, the team used single-cell RNA sequencing, which enabled them to look at a type of genetic material called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; inside each immune cell. RNA reflects which proteins a cell is making at a given moment. The team also used high-dimensional plasma proteomics, which maps the proteins circulating in blood, and spectral flow cytometry,which identifies and counts immune cells by their molecular "fingerprints."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers spotted distinct differences in memory T cells — immune cells that "remember" past infections and help the body respond faster the next time a pathogen shows up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older adults, increasing numbers of memory T cells shift into a state that changes how they respond to threats — by changing their interaction with B cells. When memory T cells are not working as they should, B cells become less effective at producing antibodies in response to infections or vaccines, the study found. Meanwhile, the memory T cells of young adults were adept at responding quickly and ramping up the expected antibody response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These immune changes seem to happen independently of inflammation and of infections with latent viruses, which stay in the body after the initial infection and may go dormant, not causing any overt symptoms. Infections with these viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), are often blamed for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/2/753" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/2/753" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;weakening the immune system with age&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the study found that people under 65 who had experienced a CMV infection at some point in their life did not have signs of faster immune aging or increased levels of inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="0802ef86-3c7c-49e8-99e8-68882fd3756c"&gt;Cohen remains cautious about the study authors' conclusions, noting that the most significant changes in the immune system tend to occur after age 65. "If you don't see a change in inflammation between 25 to 35 versus 55 to 65, is that really because inflammation isn't changing with age, or just because they didn't get old enough to see something?" he questioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said these findings could eventually help scientists design vaccines that compensate for age-related immune changes, thus better protecting older adults. They also think the results could be useful for designing treatments that restore immune function in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="7849f3da-ba44-4e55-acf6-ef38c449ad7f"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhm9t82h002s3b79qlne2pdu@published"&gt;In United States culture (at least), it is completely reasonable to expect that anyone you encounter in a nonsexual/non-relationship context will be clothed. If someone is comfortable with being nude casually, it is up to them to announce this to and confirm that it’s OK with anyone who might have them in eyeshot. There shouldn’t be surprises unless they are completely accidental (like, if your roommate thought he was home alone, but oops, wasn’t).&lt;/p&gt;

It would not be difficult for him to throw on a towel, nor would it be outrageous for you to ask him to. From a nudist’s perspective, this may come off as uptight, but the nudist’s perspective is hardly the status quo and makes no sense as a default unless otherwise discussed. Besides, in this situation, being penis-out is a graver offense than being uptight. The world is a less and less hospitable place for humankind; your home should be a place where you are comfortable 100 percent of the time, or at least as close to that as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

You say he is perfect to live with, besides his lack of a fig leaf, so you don’t want to disrupt that harmony with tension or aggression. You can preface your ask with something like, “I don’t mean to embarrass or inconvenience you,” to soften things. Your ask shouldn’t require much explanation on your part, but if it does, tell him why you’d like him to cover up as simply as possible (something like, “It would make me feel more comfortable” should do the trick). He may be oblivious and not even realize the potential issue, which strikes me as ridiculous, but possible. If you take a matter-of-fact tone and focus on informing him, the conversation may be an easy one.&lt;/p&gt;

It has become a go-to approach for supporting mental well-being across many settings.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when a practice like meditation is used in medical or therapeutic contexts, important scientific questions arise. How much practice is needed to produce benefits? And just as critically, are there any risks or unwanted side effects associated with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the kind of research that is done at the very beginning of developing any new treatment intervention program," explained Nicholas Van Dam, a psychologist at the University of Melbourne. "And for various complex reasons, with mindfulness-based programs in particular, that just didn't happen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the Possible Downsides of Meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people report positive outcomes, research over the years has also revealed that meditation can lead to adverse experiences for some individuals. These side effects may include panic attacks, intrusive or distressing memories related to past trauma (as seen in post-traumatic stress disorder), and in more extreme cases, sensations of depersonalization or dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Dam noted that estimates of how common these experiences are vary widely in the scientific literature. Some studies suggest that only about 1% of meditators experience side effects (Wong et al., 2018), whereas others report figures as high as two thirds (Britton et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify these inconsistencies, Van Dam and his colleagues conducted a study published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; to investigate how frequently meditators encounter side effects and what factors might increase the likelihood of experiencing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Nationwide Study of Meditation Experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited nearly 900 adults from across the United States. To ensure the group reflected the broader U.S. population of meditators, they used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to guide participant selection. The researchers also recruited meditators from a wide range of skill levels, from beginner to advanced, "such that we could kind of get a sense of the full sample of people who engage in meditation within the U.S.," Van Dam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Dam emphasized that the way researchers ask about side effects can dramatically influence the findings. "The devil is in the details," he said, explaining that many previous studies rely on open-ended questions, a method known as spontaneous reporting. In such cases, participants might not recognize their experiences as side effects or may hesitate to mention them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce that uncertainty, Van Dam's team developed a 30-item checklist covering possible effects of meditation. Participants rated the intensity of each effect, whether it was positive or negative, and whether it interfered with their daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Data Revealed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that nearly 60% of U.S. meditators reported at least one side effect listed on the checklist (for example, feeling anxious or disembodied). About 30% said they experienced effects that were challenging or distressing, and 9% reported that these effects caused functional impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also identified several potential risk factors. Individuals who had experienced mental health symptoms or psychological distress within the 30 days before meditating were more likely to report adverse effects. Those who attended intensive residential retreats, which often involve long periods of silent meditation, were also more likely to experience functional impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Dam noted that more research is needed to determine cause and effect. A prospective longitudinal study, he said, would help clarify how mental health and meditation interact over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging Awareness, Not Fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these findings, Van Dam cautioned against viewing meditation as dangerous. "Our conclusions are not that people should be terrified, or people should not try meditation. It's really that we think that we should do a better job of providing informed consent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He compared the situation to other therapeutic treatments, such as surgery or exposure therapy, where patients are told in advance what they might experience. This preparation allows individuals to weigh risks and make informed decisions about their participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating Discomfort in Mindfulness Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meditation, this kind of pre-discussion often doesn't happen. "We have to find a way to have that conversation and navigate that space," Van Dam said. He suggested that practitioners and clinicians should explain that discomfort can sometimes be part of the process. Feelings of unease or questioning one's sense of self are not necessarily signs of harm but rather potential aspects of deep psychological exploration. However, distress that significantly interferes with daily functioning should be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These practices are not for everyone," Van Dam concluded. "If they're not working, it's not necessarily because the person is doing something wrong. It might be because it's just not a good match."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ScienceDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:57:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5DaUYyaERBQjE1cDNuNnVqUE56WUtOX3FsaVppQUZybkdtX1dkb05obHZnWnZKSGVmWndjTm1oQ2w4angxbW1ydTV2ZHNPbHVGX1JsVTViNVV0MmVwbklIZmxpMURFQzJwREV6WUJjbw</guid></item><item><title>突破性地图揭示了大脑的真正运作方式- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251105050714.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;New research offers the strongest evidence yet that the intricate web of connections linking different regions of the human brain can reveal what each area does.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies had identified links between brain connectivity and certain mental functions, such as perception or social behavior. However, this new work expands that understanding to the entire brain. It provides what researchers describe as a "bird's eye view" of how structure and function fit together, said lead author Kelly Hiersche, a doctoral student in psychology at The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found evidence suggesting that connectivity is a fundamental organizational principle governing brain function, which has implications for understanding what happens when things go wrong in the brain," Hiersche explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Connectivity "Fingerprints" in the Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the team, the results reveal a detailed picture of the "connectivity fingerprint" for each brain region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just like how everyone's fingerprint is unique, we find that different brain regions have uniquely identifying connectivity fingerprints based on what mental function they perform," said co-author Zeynep Saygin, associate professor of psychology at Ohio State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author David Osher, assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State, added that these fingerprints allow scientists to determine the function of a region by examining its connections. "Our findings help us understand the connectivity pattern that makes a language area unique, for example, and what makes it different from adjacent areas in the brain," Osher said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Network Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uncover these relationships, the researchers used data from the Human Connectome Project, which includes MRI brain scans from 1,018 participants. These scans reveal how regions of the brain communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then turned to NeuroQuery, an online meta-analysis tool that provides brain maps for various cognitive processes. The tool predicts brain activity patterns across 33 different mental tasks, including speech, decision making, listening to music, and recognizing faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining NeuroQuery's data with their connectivity models, the researchers created computational frameworks that link how the brain is wired to how it functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Predicts Thought and Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a strong and consistent link between the brain's wiring and its activity across all regions and cognitive domains. In essence, a region's connectivity pattern could predict whether it would be active -- or inactive -- during a wide range of mental activities, from conversation to visual recognition to decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It supports a broadly held hypothesis among neuroscientists, that brain connectivity determines brain function, but this has not been explicitly shown until now, and not across such a large breadth of cognitive domains," Osher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all brain regions showed this tight connectivity-function relationship, the effect was especially pronounced in areas tied to higher-level processes such as memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These higher-level skills take many years to develop in people, much longer than sensory or social skills," Hiersche noted. "It may be that as you continually use these regions of the brain for them to develop, it results in this very tight link between connectivity and function for these higher-order skills."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing a Baseline for Future Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key outcome of the study is that this whole-brain perspective provides a reference model for how healthy young adult brains typically operate, Hiersche said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers can now use this baseline to compare the brains of people with neurological or psychiatric conditions and identify how their connectivity and function differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Knowing that connectivity is a general organizational principle of brain function across the entire brain provides a foundation for future work in this area," Hiersche concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A preculture in 5 ml of LB medium was inoculated with one clone and incubated at 37 °C under 200 rpm shaking for 4 h. Cells from the LB preculture were recovered by centrifugation (1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 10 min) and used for inoculating 200 ml of LB medium.

All of the experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU) for care of laboratory animals. The study design was approved by the ethics committees of the University of Bordeaux, of the ANSES/Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire d’Alfort/Université Paris-Est Créteil and of the University of Salento, and authorized by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research and by the Italian Ministry of Health (APAFIS 33147-2021091711598830 v6, APAFIS 37712-2022061615206629 v8, 0013178-P-17/05/2019). The mice (aged 6–8 weeks) unilaterally received 2 μl of sonicated aSyn fibrils 1B (4 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) by stereotactic delivery at a flow rate of 0.4 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the pipette was left in place for 5 min after injection to avoid leakage. Delivery was performed within the right striatum (coordinates from bregma: anteroposterior (AP), −0.1; lateral (L), +2.5; dorsoventral (DV), +3.8), or above the right SN (coordinates from bregma: AP, −2.9; L, −1.3; DV, −4.5). WT mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and transgenic M83 hemizygous mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 28) injected with either PBS, 1B fibrils or brain homogenates were euthanized after 6 weeks, 17 months, 24 months or when reaching the humane end points defined as death regarding the transgenic M83 mice, and were transcardially perfused with either Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 at 4 °C, or with cacodylate buffer 0.1 M with 1 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were subsequently postfixed in the same fixative. For standard neuropathology, the brains were paraffin embedded, and 10-µm-thick sections were cut using a rotative microtome (Leica). The sections of interest were deparaffinized and processed for epitope retrieval: the slides were immersed in citrate buffer pH 6 (Dako Agilent Technologies) and placed into a pressure cooker (Bio SB) at 114–121 °C for 10 min. After a cooling period of 20 min, the slides were washed twice for 5 min in PBS at room temperature. The slides were then processed for simple or double immunofluorescence using the following primary antibodies diluted at 1:500, or their combinations: EP1536Y (Abcam) or pSyn#64 (Wako) for detecting pS129aSyn-positive inclusions; LB509 for detecting human aSyn (Abcam, mouse monoclonal); anti-SOX10 (Abcam, rabbit monoclonal) for detecting OL nuclei; EP1532Y and anti-TH raised in chicken (anti-tyrosine hydroxylase, Abcam) for detecting the nigrostriatal tract; and anti-IBA1 (Abcam) for detecting microglia. DRAQ7 or DAPI were used to image the nuclei. The AlexaFluor-coupled secondary antibodies were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Alexa 488, 568 and 674). The sections were acquired using a Pannoramic slide scanner (3D HISTECH, MM France) in epifluorescence mode, and multichannel fluorescence optical sections of the samples were performed (thickness, &amp;lt;0.8 µm) using either a Zeiss CD7 platform of a Leica SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a spectral detector, 488, 561 and 633 nm laser lines, a motorized &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; stage and a mixed stepping motor/piezo &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; controller. The objective was ×40, and the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; step size was set to 0.5 µm to produce stacks of 15 to 20 &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; planes. The pinhole was set to 1 airy unit. For 3D reconstructions and volume rendering/animations (corresponding to 360° tilt series of composite maximum pixel projections images), raw three-channel&lt;i&gt; z&lt;/i&gt;-stack images were processed offline using Icy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="De Chaumont, F. et al.

The pregnant mouse was euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the aSyn-knockout embryos (embryonic day 18) were surgically extracted and cold-euthanized. Cortices were collected from eight of them, pooled and dissociated enzymatically and mechanically (using a neural tissue dissociation kit, C Tubes and an Octo Dissociator with heaters; Miltenyi Biotech) to yield a homogenous cell suspension pool of eight individuals. The cells were then plated at 20,000 per well in 96-well plates (Corning, BioCoat poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-lysine imaging plates) in neuronal medium (MACS Neuro Medium, Miltenyi Biotech) containing 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin, 0.5 mM alanyl-glutamine and 2% NeuroBrew supplement (Miltenyi Biotech). The cultures were maintained under 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. The medium was changed by one-third every 3 days, until 30 days in vitro (DIV). In such cultures, and under control conditions, neurons represented approximately 85 to 95% of the cell population; thus, for simplicity, they are here referred to as neurons. After 7 DIV, vehicle and sonicated 1B aSyn fibrils were added at a final concentration of 10 nM equivalent monomeric concentration. When relevant, neurons were infected at DIV 10 with AAV (adeno-associated virus) particles (multiplicity of infection, 1,000) carrying the cDNA of aSyn and its variants under the control of the human synapsin promoter, as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="De Giorgi, F. et al.

In brief, sections (thickness, 20–40 µm) were cut from perfused mouse brain on a vibratome (Leica VT1200). Immunolabelling against aSyn pathology allowed for the identification of immunopositive sections to be used for further processing with EM. For this, the sections were incubated overnight with a primary EP1536Y (Abcam) antibody at 4 °C followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody staining together with DAPI for cell nuclei identification. Fluorescence images were acquired using the Leica Thunder Tissue Imager equipped with the K8 fluorescent camera. Chosen sections with strong aSyn pathology were prepared for EM by post-fixing in reduced 2% osmium, thiocarbohydrazide and 2% osmium tetroxide, followed by contrasting in 2% uranyl acetate and lead aspartate treatment at 60 °C. The sections were dehydrated with an increasing acetone gradient, before infiltration with EMBED 812 resin for final flat embedding. The hardened sections were imaged again using light microscopy and the sections were overlayed with the overview fluorescence map by using identifiable tissue features. Regions of interest were marked and the coordinates used for laser dissection. The resulting blocks were laser cut using the Leica LMD7 system and glued onto a resin block. Serial sectioning with an ultra-microtome (Leica UC7) produced 120–200-nm-thick tissue sections that were alternatingly collected on EM grids (slot and hexagonal grids) or glass slides. The glass slides were further processed for IHC and Toluidine Blue staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light-microscopy images were acquired at ×40 magnification and correlated to each other for the generation of an image overlay of pathology signal (IHC) and high-contrast tissue morphology (Toluidine Blue). The resulting overlays were then correlated to low magnification (×640 nominal magnification) EM overviews for cell identification by using identifiable tissue features both in the LM and EM images. The identified pathology was finally imaged and merged at high magnification in a tile acquisition series. For EM image acquisition, a Thermo Fisher Scientific Talos F200C with a CETA camera or a CM100 (Phillips) with a TVIPS F416 camera were used. Light-microscopy and EM images were adjusted for brightness and contrast where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;On-grid immunogold labelling and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;EM grids with tissue sections were placed on a droplet of etching solution (1% periodic acid in water, Sigma-Aldrich), with the sections facing down, for 2.5 min. The grids were washed three times for 2 min in double-distilled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, then washed twice for 2 min in washing buffer (stock solution of 10% BSA, Aurion, which was 1:50 diluted in double-distilled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and blocked in blocking solution (Aurion) for 5 min to reduce non-specific binding. The grids were then incubated with primary antibodies (EP1526Y, Abcam, 1:50 diluted in washing buffer) for 60 min, washed 6 times for 2 min in blocking buffer and then incubated in a solution of gold nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm (protein A gold, Aurion, 1:50 diluted in washing buffer) for 90 min. They were washed three times for 2 min in blocking solution, three times for 2 min in washing buffer and four times for 1 min in double-distilled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Finally, the grids were post-stained in 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min and washed three times for 10 s in double-distilled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The sections were imaged using a transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Talos L120C), operated at an operating voltage of 120 kV, and images were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Ceta camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold particles were detected automatically in the recorded EM images, using FIJI&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Afonine, P.

Several rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed to exclude suboptimal 2D segments from further processing. The four best classes were selected and binned four times to re-extract the segments with a bigger box size encompassing the entire helical crossover. Clearly visible twisted class averages containing the entire crossover were used to generate initial de novo models using the relion_helix_inimodel2d program. The most likely twist was estimated from a crossover distance measured from 2D class averages and corroborated with the direct measurements from micrographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The helical segments (105,496) from the entire dataset were then re-extracted with a 600 pixel box size (binned by 2) comprising about 40% of the crossover. Exclusion of the suboptimal classes after 2D classification resulted in 64,889 particles. Multiple rounds of 3D autorefinement were carried out to optimize the helical twist and rise, and to check for the correct symmetry operators. This was validated from the reconstructions showing clear separation of β-strands along the helical axis. Imposing a 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cork-screw symmetry (pseudo two-fold symmetry) yielded the clear separation of β-strands when compared to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetries.

Eligible women were premenopausal, 25–45 years of age with regular menses and a residual lifetime breast cancer risk of at least 17% (≥1:6) assessed by the Tyrer–Cuzick risk estimation programme (v7.02; &lt;a href="https://ems-trials.org/riskevaluator/"&gt;https://ems-trials.org/riskevaluator/&lt;/a&gt;). All women were recruited from the Family History Risk and Prevention Clinic at the Nightingale Centre, Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, UK. Complete eligibility criteria are provided in the protocol (Supplementary Appendix &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09684-7#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Following informed consent and screening, participants underwent blood testing to confirm serum progesterone levels consistent with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (15 nmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or more; Abbott Architect Immunoassay) and then underwent a contrast-enhanced MRI scan of both breasts (Philips Achieva 1.5 T MRI). A baseline VAB was then performed by a consultant radiologist under ultrasound guidance to identify areas of fibroglandular breast tissue. On the onset of menstruation, participants commenced 5 mg oral tablets of commercially available UA, taken once daily for a duration of 12 weeks. During the final week, blood was drawn for progesterone levels, MRI of both breasts was repeated and VAB of the contralateral breast was performed. For each VAB, 10 cores were taken with a 10-G biopsy needle (cores were divided and fixed in formalin for paraffin embedding, snap frozen for RNA extraction and placed in tissue culture medium for subsequent digestion to single-cell suspensions). The primary end point was the change in epithelial cell proliferation measured by the percentage of Ki67 staining before and after treatment. Secondary end points were (1) percentage of luminal, basal and mixed colonies by morphological analysis of the adherent feeder layer assay; (2) percentage of luminal progenitor cells (EPCAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD49f&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) by flow cytometry analysis; (3) tissue stiffness assessed as the reduced indentation modulus by atomic force microscopy; (4) mean tissue section percentage fibrillar collagen assessed by PSR staining and polarized light microscopy; (5) background parenchymal enhancement assessed by MRI; (6) the side effect profile of UA assessed by CTCAE (v4.03); and (7) the relative change in Ki67 with UA treatment between those with and without known mutation in &lt;i&gt;BRCA1/2&lt;/i&gt; genes. Exploratory end points are included in the attached protocol and the methods described below. All participants had blood drawn for complete blood count, renal function and liver function tests at baseline and 3 months. Treatment with UA was suspended by the EMA/MHRA in February 2018 due to concerns of liver damage by UA. On reopening of the study after the suspension was lifted, the protocol was amended to include measurement of liver function tests every 4 weeks during treatment and a final check 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Toxicity assessment was undertaken every 4 weeks using CTCAE (v4.03).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Other human breast tissue procurement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal breast tissue samples were collected from women at moderate or high risk undergoing surgical risk-reducing mastectomy at the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust through the Manchester Cancer Research Centre Biobank. Fully informed consent from all patients was obtained in accordance with local National Research Ethics Service Guidelines, and the collection of demographic and clinical data was granted under the MCRC Biobank Research Tissue Bank Ethics (NHS NW Research Ethics Committee 18/NW/0092).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frozen primary human female breast tissue was additionally sourced from the Breast Cancer Now Tissue Bank (REC 15/EE/0192), with all procedures conducted in compliance with applicable ethical regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Breast tissue processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal breast tissue obtained via VAB (mean tissue weight of 1.22 g; 95% CI 1.06–1.37) was manually minced with a scalpel into small fragments (approximately 2 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; pieces) and incubated in dissociation medium: phenol red-free DMEM/F12 with HEPES (Gibco) supplemented with 25% BSA Fraction V solution (Gibco), 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase/hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies) and 5 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; insulin (Sigma). After overnight digestion at 37 °C with shaking at 100 rpm, the dissociated breast cell suspension was centrifuged at 450&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min at 4 °C. The fat layer was discarded and the epithelial pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium and centrifuged again. This wash step was repeated until the supernatant became clear. Then, 1 ml of pre-warmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA was added to the enriched epithelial pellet, pipetting it up and down gently with a P1000 pipette for 2–3 min. Next, 10 ml of cold Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; Gibco) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Gibco) and 2% FBS (Gibco) was added and the cells were centrifuged at 450&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant, 1 ml of pre-warmed 5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dispase (StemCell Technologies) was added to the sample and pipetted for 1 min to further dissociate cell clumps. Cells were resuspended in HBSS–HEPES–FBS solution, centrifuged and supernatant was discarded. The HBSS–HEPES–FBS solution was then added and cells were sieved using 100-μm and 40-μm filters to yield a single-cell suspension. Cells were counted using a Fuchs Rosenthal haemocytometer (mean cell yield of 1.39 million; 95% CI 0.99–1.79) and plated for experiments. Remaining cells were frozen using Bambanker freezing media (Lymphotec Inc.) until further analysis (for example, flow cytometry and scRNA-seq).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal breast tissue obtained via risk-reducing mastectomy was cut into 2–3 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; pieces and digested overnight at 37 °C with collagenase IA (C2674, Sigma) and hyaluronidase (H3506, Sigma), both to a final concentration of 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, in phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco). Following enzyme digestion, the breast tissue was washed three times with medium by centrifuging at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min and discarding the supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in medium and left to sediment three times for 25 min at 4 °C on a flat surface. The collected breast organoids or microstructures from each tissue preparation were frozen in Bambanker freezing medium until experimental use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Measurement of progesterone (P4) levels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serum progesterone levels were determined at baseline and after 3 months of anti-progestin treatment. Serum progesterone concentrations were measured by an NHS-accredited laboratory using the Abbott Architect immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Ki67 staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemistry was performed using an automated Ventana medical system (BenchMark Ultra) using the UltraVIEW universal DAB detection kit (760–500, Roche). Slides were de-paraffinized under standardized conditions, blocked by endogenous biotin blocking kit (Ventana) and incubated for 32 min with Confirm Anti-Ki67 (30-9) antibody (Ventana 790–4286, Roche). Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin II and bluing reagent (Ventana 760–2021 and 760–2037), dehydrated and coverslipped. Slides were scanned using a Leica SCN400 slide scanner and visualized using Aperio ImageScope Digital Pathology Slide viewer (Leica Biosystems). A breast pathologist (S.P.) confirmed the percentage of Ki-67-positive epithelial cells by assessing a minimum of 1,000 epithelial cells per sample. Ki67 quantification was independently performed by a researcher fully blinded to participant number and timepoint using the HALO software, with Cohen’s kappa score (0.62) confirming substantial agreement between the two assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Tissue morphometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate morphological alterations in normal breast tissues, haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) stained sections were scanned using a Leica SCN400 slide scanner. Digital images were visualized using Aperio ImageScope Digital Pathology Slide viewer (Leica Biosystems) and the lobules and acini tissue compartments were manually annotated. The area of each lobule as well as the area of each acinus within the lobule was measured to calculate the ratio of acinar-to-lobular area. This analysis was performed blind to participant number and timepoint. The average acinar-to-lobular ratio of at least three lobules was calculated at the baseline and post-treatment for each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Flow cytometry analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-cell suspensions of digested breast tissue were incubated with primary antibodies for 10 min on ice according to the manufacturer’s guidance. For endothelial and haematopoietic lineage depletion, CD31 (13-0319-82, eBioscience) and CD45 (304004, BioLegend) biotin-conjugated antibodies were used, followed by incubation with the secondary APC–Cy7 streptavidin-conjugated antibody (405208, BioLegend). To identify epithelial subpopulations, CD49f–APC (313616, BioLegend) and EPCAM–FITC (10109, StemCell Technologies) antibodies were used. Following each incubation, cells were washed with PBS, and at the end, they were resuspended with flow cytometry buffer containing HBSS (14025, Gibco), 10 mM HEPES (15630-056, Gibco), 2% FBS (Gibco) and 2 mM EDTA (Sigma). DAPI (422801, BioLegend) was added for dead cell exclusion. Data were acquired on a LSR II (BD) flow cytometer and analysed using the BD FACSDiva software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Mammosphere colony assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast epithelial cells were plated in six-well plates treated with poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (poly-HEMA; Sigma) at a density of 1,000 cells per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; following the protocol previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Shaw, F.

Three separate culture dishes per condition were plated and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 10–12 days. Cells were fixed with acetone:methanol (1:1), air dried, rinsed with distilled water and stained with Giemsa (Sigma) for 2–3 min. Colonies were defined as discrete clusters of 50 or more cells and classified according to established morphological criteria. All three colony types could be observed on the same plate: luminal colonies appeared as tightly packed, cobblestone-like clusters with smooth, well-defined edges; myoepithelial colonies consisted of dispersed, teardrop-shaped, spindle-like cells with visible gaps between them; and mixed colonies displayed features of both, with irregular, non-uniform edges&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Eirew, P. et al.

Three peri-lobular regions (100 × 100 μm) were identified for each participant sample from a H&amp;amp;E-stained section, and the same region was then located on an unstained sequential slice to be probed. Immediately before the experiment, each participant sample was allowed to thaw and dry at room temperature for 2 h, followed by five quick washes in deionized water to remove the optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Atomic force microscopy was conducted using the Peakforce Quantitative Nanomechanics mode in fluid on the BioScope Resolve AFM (Bruker), with a cantilever of spring constant 0.14–0.16 N m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; that is attached with a gold spherical probe of 5 µm diameter (CONT-Silicon-SPM-Sensor with colloidal particle, sQUBE). Calibration of probe deflection sensitivity and spring constant were conducted for every participant sample. To obtain the force curve, the cantilever was indented to a depth of 50 nm into the sample at a rate of 6 µm s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the reduced elastic modulus of the sample was estimated based on the Hertzian model (spherical), taking 75% and 25% of maximum force on the force curve as fitting boundary. The results of this study were kept as reduced modulus with no assumption made on the Poisson’s ratio. A total of 400 force curves were obtained evenly throughout each 100 × 100 µm peri-lobular region to give a total of 1,200 force curves per participant sample (3 × 400). The force curves were filtered to remove those that poorly fit the Hertzian model (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt; 0.95), followed by values that lie outside 2 standard deviations from the remaining population. The final population of force curves were subjected to a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test to determine any significant differences in the reduced modulus between baseline and treated participant samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Tissue bulk RNA-seq analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only good-quality RNA samples (RNA integrity number (RIN) &amp;gt; 8) were considered adequate for library preparation. Indexed PolyA libraries were prepared using 100 ng of total RNA and 15 cycles of amplification in the Agilent Sure Select Strand Specific RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina Sequencing (G9691B, Agilent). Libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR using a Kapa Library Quantification Kit for Illumina sequencing platforms (KK4873, Kapa Biosystems). Paired-end 75-bp sequencing was carried out by clustering 2.0 pM of the pooled libraries on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fastq files were processed with Nextflow (v19.10.0), nf-core/rnaseq (v1.3) and aligned using GRCh38 as reference. Samples with low base quality or genomic DNA contamination were excluded from the analysis. Additional gene identifiers (gene symbols, Entrez ID, gene type) were retrieved from Ensembl BioMart (v101; &lt;a href="https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/"&gt;https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/&lt;/a&gt;). Differentially expressed gene analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v1.26.0) with a multifactor design formula that accounted for treatment and participant ID. A heatmap was generated with ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0) and principal component analysis was performed using variance-stabilizing transformation values from DESeq2, stats (v3.6.0) and SummarisedExperiment (v1.16.1). Gene Ontology terms were downloaded from Ensembl BioMart (&lt;a href="https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/"&gt;https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/&lt;/a&gt;) using Ensembl Genes 103 and Human Genes GRCh38.p13, selecting the attributes ‘Gene stable ID’, ‘Gene name’ and ‘GO term name’.

From tissue sections mounted on MMI slides, regions of ‘lobular epithelium and peri-lobular stroma’ were dissected using a MMI CellCut Laser Microdissection system across multiple sections. Tissue areas of 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were collected using MMI transparent isolation caps and pooled to a final volume of 0.05 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Formalin-mediated protein crosslinking was reversed by resuspending the dissected tissue in 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) containing 5% SDS (w/v) and heating at 95 °C for 20 min, then 60 °C for 2 h. To assist the solubilization of ECM proteins, urea and dithiothreitol was added to the samples to a final concentration of 8 M and 5 mM, respectively. Samples were then sonicated in a LE220-Plus focused ultrasonicator (Covaris) for 10 min. Samples were reduced and alkylated, then proteins were isolated and digested with trypsin using S-Trap spin columns (Protifi) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Peptides were desalted using POROS Oligo R3 beads (Thermo Fisher) and analysed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry using an UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC system (RSLC, Dionex Corporation) coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) for 90 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Proteomics data analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw mass spectra were processed in MaxQuant (v1.6.14.0, available from Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 53" title="Tyanova, S. et al.

To infer a ‘per cell’ contribution to cell–cell communication, each broad cell population was downsampled to 985 cells per treatment group (baseline and post-UA treatment). Communication probability between cell types was then assessed using a 3% truncated mean with a minimum of ten cells per group. Differential cell–cell communication was compared before or after UA treatment using default settings in the CellChat R package. This analysis was similarly repeated downsampling iHBCA-annotated BC-APPS1 data to 300 cells per subcluster to ensure coverage of each subcluster.

Differentially expressed LHS ligands (pairwise logFC ≤ −0.4 (de_coef) and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 (de_pval)) were selected as input. Intersection of pairwise differentially expressed gene list with those annotated as ‘ligand’ in the NicheNet (v2.2.0) L–R network database (‘lr_network_human_21122021.rds’) facilitated identification of downregulated LHS ligands. Similarly, downregulated FB1–3 and BMYO1 targets genes were identified from Memento results (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09684-7#MOESM4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, pairwise logFC ≤  −0.25 (de_coef) and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 (de_pval)). These downregulated target genes were intersected with a collagen gene list to identify which collagens within each subcluster were candidate target genes. A liberal minimum threshold of 3% receptor expression in receiver cells was used, and no differential receptor expression criteria was applied, given that co-regulation of ligand and receptor is not essential for target gene regulation. NicheNet analyses were performed using all genes as background and no downsampling was used in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Imaging mass cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For eight participants (02, 06, 12, 14, 17, 22, 24 and 31), 5-µm sections from FFPE tissue blocks were mounted onto a single glass slide. Sections were dewaxed with two sequential 10-min xylene incubations, then rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol in water (100%, 95%, 80%, 70% and 0%; 10 min each). Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating rehydrated sections in ‘Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9’ (S236784-2, Dako) for 20 min at 95 °C in a steam producing water bath, before removing the heat source and allowing the water bath to cool to room temperature over 20 min. Sections were washed three times in PBS (Maxpar PBS; 201058, Standard BioTools), then blocked in 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. A cocktail of metal-conjugated antibodies and 0.5% BSA in PBS was made up and added to sections, incubating overnight at 4 °C. The antibodies used included α-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4, 141Pr), E-cadherin (clone 24E10, 158Gd), Ki67 (clone B56, 168Er) and collagen I (polyclonal, 169Tm) from Standard BioTools (201508, Maxpar Human Immuno-oncology IMC panel kit), as well as fibronectin (polyclonal, 149Sm; ab23750, Abcam), collagen VI (polyclonal, 160Gd; ab6588, Abcam) and SOX9 (clone EPR14335, 147Sm; 3147022D, Standard BioTools). Fibronectin and collagen VI carrier-free antibodies were conjugated to metal isotopes using MaxPar X8 antibody labelling kits (149Sm, 201149 A; 160Gd, 201160B, Standard BioTools) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Following antibody incubation, sections were washed twice in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and then twice in PBS. Nucleic acids were then stained by incubating section with Cell-ID Intercalator (201192A, Standard BioTools) for 30 min, then washed in ddH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and allowed to air dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw imaging mass cytometry data were acquired by ablating sections using a Hyperion Imaging System (Standard BioTools). For each slide, the histology of sections was inspected using the inbuilt light microscope and regions of interest were selected that contained lobular tissue. Approximately 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of tissue from at least three discrete regions of interest were ablated in a rastered pattern at 200 Hz per section. To ensure that the order of section acquisition did not create artefacts in the data, slides were randomly allocated to two equally sized groups, one group in which ablation was ordered baseline then post-treatment and a second group in which ablation was performed post-treatment then baseline. Raw data files (TXT) were converted to TIFF format and segmented into single-cell objects using the Steinbock pipeline&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Windhager, J. et al.

Hot pixels were filtered using a threshold value of ‘50’, whereas single-cell objects were segmented using the ‘Deepcell, cell segmentation’ function. Object intensity values were exported as CSV files and passed to the single-cell neighbourhood analysis pipeline. Selection of cells of interest and proximal ECM quantification was performed in MATLAB (please refer to the ‘Code availability’ section). In brief, after image noise removal, each channel was normalized between 0 and 1. Then, epithelium and void tissue regions were identified and masks for individual cells were generated. Cells of interest were then defined as those where mean intensity for a particular channel (for example, ‘SOX9’) is higher than a given threshold value. To define threshold values, for each image, an initial analyst, blinded to slide identity and referencing a common reference image, selected a pixel intensity threshold to captured cells exhibiting comparable staining intensity and cellular distribution. Thresholding was confirmed by a subsequent, independent analysis. To define SOX9&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cells, SOX9&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cells were first defined per image, then the equivalent number of the lowest expressing cells per image were classified as SOX9&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;. Changing the SOX9&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; and SOX9&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; threshold analysis to either a fixed top or bottom 20% expression or a fixed-intensity value produced similar results to those reported (data not shown). Around each cell of interest, a circular region of interest of a given radius was defined in such a way that it did not include any neighbouring cells and the void regions, and mean intensity within the circular region of interest was calculated for each channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;VitroGel assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal breast tissue organoids (3D microstructures) obtained from women at moderate or high risk of breast cancer were plated in 12-well plates in the presence of a polysaccharide-based synthetic hydrogel modified with the collagen-mimetic peptide GFOGER (VitroGel, TWG009, The Well Biosciences) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Organoids were cultured with VitroGel in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco) with 8% charcoal-stripped FBS (Gibco), 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; EGF (Sigma-Aldrich). Using VitroGel dilution solution, the hydrogel was used in a ratio of 1:4 and 1:2, which represents soft (600–900 Pa, Young’s modulus) and stiff (1,800–3,000 Pa, Young’s modulus) conditions, respectively. Organoids were treated with onapristone (100 nM) or DMSO (control) every 72 h. After 1-week incubation at 37 °C, cells were isolated from the hydrogel using VitroGel Cell Recovery Solution (MS03-100, The Well Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were counted before undergoing further analysis: mammosphere colony assay and RNA or protein extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Real-time PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (74034, Qiagen) as described in the manufacturer’s handbook. RNA quality was checked using a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA reverse transcription to synthesize cDNA was done by using Omniscript RT kit (205111, Qiagen). Of each cDNA sample, 100 ng was then used in triplicate to perform quantitative PCR with Taqman Universal PCR master mix (4304437, Applied Biosystems) and Thermo Fisher gene expression assays for &lt;i&gt;TNFSF11&lt;/i&gt; (Hs00243522_m1), &lt;i&gt;SOX9&lt;/i&gt; (Hs00165814_m1) and &lt;i&gt;KIT&lt;/i&gt; (Hs00174029_m1). Housekeeping gene, encoding β&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;actin, expression assay (Hs99999903_m1) was used to normalize the gene expression. Gene expression was measured using the QuantStudio 5 Real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher) and analysed using QuantStudio Design and Analysis software (Desktop; v2.6.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Western blot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein lysates were fractionated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85, Whatman). The membranes were incubated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific antibody binding, and then probed with primary and secondary antibodies to identify the proteins of interest. The primary antibodies used were 1:1,000 dilution of anti-SOX9 rabbit poly-antibody (AB5535, Sigma), 1:1,000 dilution of anti-KIT mouse poly-antibody (MAB332, R&amp;amp;D Biosystems) and 1:5,000 dilution of anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (A1978, Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit (41424306, Dako) and anti-mouse (41424131, Dako) were used at a 1:5,000 dilution and proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase reagents Classico, Forte (Millipore) or West Femto (Thermo Fisher). Proteins were visualized by acquiring digital images with ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Densitometry was carried out on the digital images using Image Lab (v6.1; BioRad) and proteins of interest were normalized to β-actin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Statistical analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not stated otherwise, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were generated using the ‘stat_compare_means’ function from the ‘ggpubr’ package (v0.6.0), applying the wilcox.test method. This performs either a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for independent samples. Exact &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are reported when there are no tied values. When ties are present, an approximate &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value was calculated with a correction for ties. A value of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Data are shown as median and interquartile range with connecting lines between paired data points, unless otherwise indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Ethics and inclusion statement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research has included local researchers throughout: in the study design, study implementation, data ownership and authorship of publications.

For transfections, cells were seeded 1 day before and transfected at a cell density of 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml using polyethyleneimine (PEI) with a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:2.

For permeabilized cell assays, collected cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer KPS (140 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1 mM KEGTA and 20 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.2). Cells were permeabilized using 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; high-purity digitonin (GoldBio) and treated with apyrase (2 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Sigma-Aldrich), optionally with increasing GDPβS concentrations, then transferred to 96-well plates containing the respective ligand in ligand buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1× HBSS, 0.1% BSA) or KPS for permeabilized cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steady state BRET measurements were performed using a PHERAstar FSX multimode plate reader (BMG Biotech). BRET2-specific filters were used: emission 410 nm (80 nm slit) and emission 515 nm (30 nm slit). Coelenterazine 400a (5 μM; Nanolight) dissolved in NanoFuel Solvent was added to all wells immediately before measuring with Rluc8. Raw netBRET signals were calculated as the emission intensity at 515 nm divided by the emission intensity at 410 nm, with no normalization or further data treatment applied to reported results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each assay was conducted in at least three biologically independent (separate transfection) experiments, on different days, with all data points measured in triplicate. EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values were calculated in GraphPad Prism 10 (v.10.6.0) by fitting the raw netBRET results from each experiment, followed by non-linear regression using the equations: &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(1+{10}^{({\mbox{logEC}}_{50}-x)}\)&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(1+{10}^{(x-{\mbox{logIC}}_{50})}\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;cAMP inhibition assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1× HBSS, pH 7.4) and plated into 96-well white cell culture plates at a density of 200,000 cells in 90 μl per well. Ligands were prepared as 3× solutions in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1× HBSS, pH 7.4). Media was aspirated and cells were incubated with 30 μl per well of drug buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1× HBSS, pH 7.4), followed by addition of 30 μl of 3× drug solutions for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells then received 30 μl of luciferin (Goldbio, 4 mM final concentration) supplemented with isoproterenol (100 μM final concentration) to stimulate production of endogenous cAMP through β2 adrenergic Gs activation, and were incubated in the dark at room temperature. After 15 min, luminescence intensity was quantified using a PHERAstar FSX multimode plate reader (BMG Biotech). Data were plotted as a function of ligand or nucleotide concentration and analysed using log (ligand or nucleotide) versus response in GraphPad Prism (v.10.6.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Radioligand saturation binding assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radioligand binding assays were conducted using membrane fractions from HEK293F cells transiently expressing human wild-type MOR. For membrane preparation, cell pellets expressing human wild-type MOR and Gα&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;-Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Gγ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at a 1:1 ratio were gathered and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 20 mM KCl supplemented with 2 mM AEBSF, 14 μM E-64, 1 μM leupeptin and 0.3 μM aprotinin). Cells were dounce homogenized and centrifuged at 175,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; in two rounds to obtain membrane fractions. Membrane protein concentration was determined to be roughly 4 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; using a Bradford assay (Pierce). Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition binding assays were setup in 96-well plates containing membrane fractions diluted to 0.15 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, along with [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]naltrexone at 2 nM and a ‘cold’ naltrexone dose (100 µM–10 pM), all prepared in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 20 mM KCl, 0.1% BSA and 100 µM Bacitracin). Competition reactions were incubated for 1 h and terminated by vacuum filtration onto cold 0.3% PEI-soaked GF/A filters, followed by 3 rounds of washing with cold 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.50). Counts were read using a Microbeta2 plate reader (PerkinElmer) for 1 min per well. Results were analysed in GraphPad Prism v.10.6.0, and the inhibitor constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) was determined using the ‘One site - Fit Ki’ model equation: logEC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = log(&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({10}^{\mbox{log}{K}_{i}\times (1\,+\,\mbox{RadioligandNM}/\mbox{HotKdNM})}\)&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; = Bottom + (Top − Bottom)/(&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(1+{10}^{(x-{\mbox{logEC}}_{50})}\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;MOR expression and purification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recombinant expression of the pFastBac1-MOR constructs was carried out in &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera frugiperda&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sf&lt;/i&gt;9) insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Gibco).

To enhance receptor surface expression and improve protein yield, 10 µM naloxone was added during protein expression. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 27 °C with shaking at 100 rpm, then collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS and stored at −80 °C until further use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For membrane preparation, frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 20 mM KCl, with protease inhibitors: 2 mM AEBSF, 14 μM E-64, 1 μM leupeptin and 0.3 μM aprotinin). The suspension was homogenized using a glass dounce homogenizer and further treated with hypertonic buffer (hypotonic buffer + 1 M NaCl). Membranes were harvested by ultracentrifugation at 150,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 45 min at 4 °C. This washing and centrifugation process was repeated 2 more times, with 10 μM naloxone included in the final 2 washes. Final membrane pellets were homogenized in purification buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 10 μM naloxone) supplemented with 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For protein solubilization, membranes were thawed in the presence of 2 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; iodoacetamide and diluted in 2× solubilization buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% w/v lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) and 0.1% w/v cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS)) and incubated for 8 h at 4 °C. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 150,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with M2 anti-Flag affinity resin (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C.

For naloxone-bound complexes, a total of 30,264 (MOR–Nb6), 45,722 (‘re-bound’ MOR–G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;–GDP), 17,742 (‘constant’ MOR–G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;–GDP) and 32,514 (MOR–G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;–nucleotide-free) micrographs were preprocessed through patch contrast transfer function estimation (default parameters), and micrographs with average contrast transfer function resolution estimates above 4 Å were discarded. For loperamide-bound complexes, 22,868 (re-bound MOR–G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;–GDP) and 22,146 (constant MOR–G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;–GDP) micrographs were collected and preprocessed similarly. An initial round of processing was carried out on a subset of the data (roughly 5,000 micrographs), using the reference-free Blob picker (140 Å particle diameter) routine, followed by two-dimensional (2D) classification until 2D classes with clearly distinguishable transmembrane domain (TMD) densities were obtained. Ab initio reconstruction of these 2D classes was performed to obtain a 3D model used for template-based picking and 3D reconstructions of all three full datasets (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09677-6#Fig7"&gt;3–&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09677-6#Fig9"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). Particle picking on the entire dataset (20 Å reference low pass) was followed by extraction with a box size of 128 pixels (bin 4; 512 pixels uncropped box size). Three to four rounds of 2D classification were performed to obtain homogenous 2D classes with distinguishable TMD densities (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09677-6#Fig7"&gt;3–&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09677-6#Fig9"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), after which particles were re-extracted (bin 2, box size 256). Further 2D classification was used to separate complexes with ‘open’ or ‘closed’ AHD conformations, followed by multiclass ab initio reconstructions of each particle subset. The resulting 3D volumes were used to perform several rounds of heterogeneous refinement, on the re-extracted particle stack resulting in segregation of particles into five classes. A combination of ab initio reconstruction, non-uniform refinement and 2D classification was performed on particle subsets corresponding to MOR–G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; complexes. Finally, local refinements with a manually created mask around the TMD, masking the micelle and the heterotrimeric G protein yielded the final reconstructions of maps ranging between 2.8 Å and 3.8 Å.

Cell death was monitored every 3 h using SYTOX Green (25 nM) in the Incucyte S3 (Sartorius) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Isolation of lysosome-enriched fractions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lysosome-enriched fractions were isolated using the Lysosome Isolation Kit (Abcam, ab234047) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells were washed and centrifuged at 600&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min and the supernatant was removed. Cells were resuspended in Lysosome Isolation Buffer, vortexed and incubated on ice for 2 min. Complete cell disruption was obtained using a dounce homogenizer. After adding Lysosome Enrichment Buffer, the homogenate was centrifuged at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to the top of a discontinuous gradient density and an ultracentrifugation at 145,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 2 h at 4 °C was performed. The lysosome-enriched fraction was present in the top 10% of the gradient volume. For western blot analyses, the protein content of the lysosomal-enriched gradient supernatant was quantified using the Qbit 1 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a protein quantification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33212). Equal total protein amounts of total cell extracts and lysosome-enriched extracts were loaded for comparison for western blot analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Isolation of Golgi-enriched fractions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golgi-enriched fractions were isolated using the Golgi enrichment extraction kit (Invent, GO-037) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, filter cartridges were placed and cooled on ice for several minutes. Then, 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, washed with 1× PBS and centrifuged again at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A with vigorous shaking. The filter cartridge was capped, the tube inverted several times and centrifuged at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 s. The tube was then centrifuged at 4 °C at 5,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min without removing the filter. The filter was then removed and the supernatant transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 4 °C at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube. An equivalent in volume of buffer B was added to the supernatant, the resulting mixture incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 8,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. The pellet was then resuspended in buffer A and mixed by pipetting up and down 50 times and subsequently centrifuged at 8,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube and ice old buffer C was added, mixed by vortexing for 20 s and incubated on ice for 20 min. The tube was then centrifuged at 8,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min and the supernatant removed. The pellet was resuspended Laemmli buffer for subsequent western blot analysis. For western blot analyses, the protein content of the Golgi-enriched extracts was quantified using the Qbit 1 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a protein quantification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33212). Equal total protein amounts of total cell extracts and lysosome-enriched extracts were loaded for comparison for western blot analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Isolation of ER-enriched fraction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ER were isolated using the ER enrichment extraction kit (Novus Biologicals, NBP2-29482) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 500 µl of 1 × isosmotic homogenization buffer followed by 5 µl of 100× PIC were added to a pellet of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 12,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min at 4 °C. The floating lipid layer was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged in a clean centrifuge tube using an ultracentrifuge at 90,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 1 h. The resulting pellet contained the total ER fraction (rough and smooth). The pellet was resuspended Laemmli buffer for subsequent western blot analysis. For western blot analyses, the protein content of the ER-enriched extracts was quantified using the Qbit 1 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a protein quantification kit (thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33212).

Raw sequencing reads were trimmed and quality-filtered using Trimmomatic and FastQC, respectively. Transcript abundance was quantified with Salmon v.0.7.2 using quasi-mapping mode and corrected for sequence, GC and positional biases, using the mouse genome GRCm38 GENCODE release M11. TPM values were computed using tximport and renormalized after removing mitochondrial transcripts. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 with regularized log-transformed counts. Hierarchical clustering and PCA analyses used Spearman correlations from the top 1,000 highly variable genes. Heat maps (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09709-1#Fig6"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;) were generated using heatmap3 from the top 200 differentially expressed genes.

In brief, cells were permeabilized and DNA was transposed using Tn5 transposase. Libraries were purified, amplified and sequenced (NovaSeq, 2 × 100 cycles, around 50 million paired reads per sample). Reads were mapped to mm10 (hisat2), duplicates removed (Picard) and peaks were called using MACS2. Normalized coverage was visualized in IGV. Transcription factor activity and motif enrichment were assessed with Chromvar and HOMER, respectively. Data were deposited at the GEO (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117529"&gt;GSE117529&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;RNA isolation and qPCR analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74134), and cDNA was synthesized using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad, 1708841). qPCR was performed using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, 1725121) on the BioRad CFX96 system. The primers used were as follows: mNRF2_F: AACGACAGAAACCTCCATCTAC; mNRF2_R: AGTAAGGCTTTCCATCCTCATC; mFSP1_F: GCAATGAGTATCGGGAGTACAT; mFSP1_R: GTAGGCAGAGCTGTTGATCTT; mGPX4_F: ACTGACGTAAACTACACTCAGC; mGPX4_R: GGAAGGCCAGGATTCGTAAA; RNA pol II_F: ACTGTGCGGAACTCCATCAA; RNA pol II_R: AGCCAGGTTCTGGAACTCAA; mPPIB_F: CATCAAGGACTTCATGATCCA; mPPIB_R: ATAGATGCTCTTTCCTCCTGTG. RNA pol II and PPIB amplification were used as reference genes. PPIB was used as a housekeeping gene for qPCR analyses of parental and LN metastatic lines, while RNA Pol II was used for qPCR analyses of BTZ treatment under 21% and 1% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Metabolite extraction and LC–MS analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For metabolite extraction, 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h. The medium was then aspirated, and cells were washed with cold normal saline (9 g l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; sodium chloride). Immediately, 400 µl of extraction buffer (methanol:acetonitrile:water, 40:40:20, with 0.5% formic acid) was added per well, and the plates were incubated on ice for 5–10 min. The samples were neutralized with 35 µl of 15% ammonium bicarbonate (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), cells were scraped and lysates were transferred to 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min. A total of 80 µl of supernatant was transferred to LC–MS vials, and 20 µl from each sample was pooled to generate a quality control sample. All of the extracts were stored at –80 °C until analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolites were analysed using a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). Separation was performed using an XBridge BEH Amide XP column (2.5 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm) with a guard column (2.5 µm, 2.1 × 5 mm; Waters). Mobile phase A consisted of water:acetonitrile (95:5) and mobile phase B comprised water:acetonitrile (20:80), both containing 10 mM ammonium acetate and 10 mM ammonium hydroxide. The gradient was as follows: 0–3 min, 100% B; 3.2–6.2 min, 90% B; 6.5–10.5 min, 80% B; 10.7–13.5 min, 70% B; 13.7–16 min, 45% B; 16.5–22 min, 100% B. The flow rate was 0.3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The autosampler was maintained at 4 °C and the column at 30 °C. The injection volume was 5 µl. Needle washes were performed between injections using acetonitrile:methanol:water (4:4:2, v/v/v).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS1 scans were acquired from &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 70 to 1,000 with polarity switching and a resolution of 120,000 (at &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 200). Other MS parameters were as follows: sheath gas, 40; auxiliary gas, 10; sweep gas, 2; spray voltage, 3.5 kV; capillary temperature, 300 °C; S-lens RF level, 45; maximum injection time, 500 ms; AGC target, 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw data were converted to mzXML format using msConvert and analysed in El-Maven (Elucidata) for targeted metabolite identification based on accurate mass and retention time, using an in-house standard library. Data were normalized to protein content and analysed in MetaboAnalyst 6.0 (&lt;a href="https://www.metaboanalyst.ca"&gt;https://www.metaboanalyst.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;GSH measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells (5,000 per well) were seeded into 96-well plates, and GSH levels were assessed using the GSH/GSSG-Glo assay (Promega, V6611). Parallel cell viability assessments were used for data normalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Seahorse assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells (5,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates and analysed using the Seahorse XF24 system. Oxygen consumption rates were measured sequentially after oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (1 μM) and rotenone/antimycin A (0.5 μM each). Data were normalized to protein content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;s.c. and i.n. tumour models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were housed under sterile conditions with sterilized standard chow and water provided ad libitum and maintained under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle and 22 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity. Animals were allocated randomly to treatment groups, and the samples were processed in an arbitrary order. No formal randomization or blinding was applied. The maximum permitted tumour diameter of 2.0 cm was not exceeded in any of the experiments. All procedures complied with institutional ethical guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (protocol IS00003460) or the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol APLAC-34518).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For s.c. injections, 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; B16-F10 WT Luc, B16-F10 &lt;i&gt;Fsp1-&lt;/i&gt;KO Luc, or LN7 1134BL WT or &lt;i&gt;Fsp1-&lt;/i&gt;KO cells were suspended in 100 µl of DMEM without phenol red and injected into either the right or left flank of 6–8-week-old male or female C57BL/6J or C57BL/6N mice&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Breuer, C.

Microglial cultures were treated with liposomes resuspended in PBS at 0.1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for 12 h and 3 days, unless otherwise stated. For washout experiments, cells were treated with PS/PC liposome or vehicle for 3 days, the liposome-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium and cells were analysed 4 days later. Liposome-treated cells were imaged at the end of the 3-day treatment. For PLCi and PLC activator (PLCa) experiments, we used 0.1 μM U73122 (PLCi; Tocris) and 40 μM m-3M3FBS (PLCa; Tocris). U73122 was first dissolved in chloroform at 100 mM. This solution was aliquoted and dehydrated using nitrogen. The dehydrated film was dissolved in DMSO at 5 mM. m-3M3FBS was prepared using DMSO. The final DMSO concentration in the medium was 0.2%. PLCi was added 1 h before liposome treatment. For CLEC7A activation, pustulan (InvivoGen; tlrl-pst) was resuspended in PBS.

Detection was performed using the DISCOVERY Purple HRP Kit, DISCOVERY Green HRP Kit and DISCOVERY Yellow HRP Kit (760-229, 760-271 and 760-250, respectively; Roche Diagnostics). Sodium citrate antigen retrieval (pH 6.0) was used between rounds to remove the antibody from the previous round and avoid cross-reactivity. Haematoxylin and bluing reagent (760-2021 and 760-2037; Roche Diagnostics) were used as a nuclear counterstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Image analysis of immunohistochemistry of human brain tissue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital images of the stained sections were captured at ×40 using the Aperio GT 450 high-resolution scanner (Leica Biosystems). Images were also acquired using the Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope at ×20 and ×40 magnification. Images were analysed using QuPath (v.0.5.1). For each sample, three regions of interest (ROI) were annotated in plaque-dense areas, and three ROI were annotated in plaque-depleted areas in the cortical grey matter, with each ROI measuring 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Microglia were manually counted in each ROI. Microglia were considered plaque-associated if there was at least one IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; process co-localized with an amyloid-β plaque. If microglia did not meet these criteria, the cell was considered distal. PU.1 level was manually scored as either low or high on the basis of the staining intensity of PU.1 within microglia nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Immunocytochemistry of primary microglia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For PU.1 and CD28 quantification, primary microglia isolated by anti-CD11B antibody were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 15 min, followed by three more PBS washes. Coverslips were washed and permeabilized with 0.2% PBS–Tween, followed by a 1-h blocking step with 4% normal goat serum in 0.2% PBS–Tween. The coverslips were then incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: PU.1 (1:200 Cell Signaling Technology; 2258), CD11B (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 14-0112-85) and IBA1 (1:500; Synaptic Systems; 234 009) to label microglia and/or CD28 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology; 38774).The coverslips were washed three times with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit 1:500 and goat anti-rat 1:500), conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546 or Alexa Fluor 568. To label nuclei, the coverslips were washed twice in PBST and once in PBS and then stained with DAPI (1:10,000 in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature.The coverslips were then embedded on a microscopy slide using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen) and dried overnight. Imaging was performed using an LSM 780 confocal microscope (ZEISS). For &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack images, 20-μm &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack confocal images were acquired at 2-μm intervals, with ×20 objective at ×1 zoom. Image processing was performed using ZEN 2011 software (ZEISS). Image quantification of CD28 in vitro, &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-section confocal microscopy images were applied to custom ImageJ macros. Using the maximum intensity projected &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; stack of the CD28 channel, the CD28 signal was detected using the default ImageJ threshold and measured using integrated density (as shown in figure quantifications unless otherwise specified) and mean grey value, both of which yielded comparable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Combined RNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry of primary microglia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 min, followed by three more PBS washes. Coverslips were then dehydrated in 50%, 70% and 100% ethanol and allowed to dry before in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed using RNAscope custom-designed probes for &lt;i&gt;Spi1&lt;/i&gt; in combination with the RNAScope 2.0 RED Kit, according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). After completing in situ hybridization, sections were rinsed with double-distilled water and a gradient concentration of PBS (0.1×–1×) before the colorimetric reaction, blocked in 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: PU.1 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology; 2258) and CD11B (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 14-0112-85) to label microglia. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBST and incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit 1:500; goat anti-rat 1:500, conjugated to the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546) for 1 h at room temperature. To label nuclei, the coverslips were washed twice in PBST and once in PBS and then stained with DAPI (1:10,000 in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were rinsed with a gradient concentration of PBS (0.1×–1×) and ddH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, subjected to colorimetric reaction, dried for 15 min at 60 °C, mounted using EcoMount (EM897L; Biocare Medical) and dried overnight. &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-stack images were taken on a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope with 20-μm &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack confocal images acquired at 2-μm intervals and ×20 objective at ×1 zoom.

Nuclei in the DAPI channel were segmented using the default ImageJ threshold, followed by the ‘AnalyzeParticles’ function without size and circularity constraints to identify all microglia nuclei. These DAPI ROI were then projected onto PU.1 maximum intensity projected &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; stack of the corresponding PU.1 channel to measure the nuclear PU.1 signal through mean grey value (as shown in figure quantifications unless otherwise specified) and integrated density measurements, both of which yielded comparable results in PU.1 signal in treatment versus control conditions. For the quantification of microglia &lt;i&gt;Spi1&lt;/i&gt; signal from in situ hybridization and correlation analyses between PU.1 versus &lt;i&gt;Spi1&lt;/i&gt; signal within microglia, the ImageJ freehand selection tool was used to manually outline the borders of individual microglia (ROI for &lt;i&gt;Spi1&lt;/i&gt;) along with their corresponding nuclei (ROI for PU.1). Within these microglia, the ROI mean grey value and integrated density measurements were calculated, yielding comparable results in &lt;i&gt;Spi1&lt;/i&gt; and PU.1 signal in treatment versus control. At least 30 microglia from each coverslip from each condition were quantified this way, and the average mean grey value of these cells is shown in the figure quantifications unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Preparation of mouse tissue for imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For immunofluorescence and RNA in situ hybridization of mouse tissue, mice were anaesthetized with ketamine (120 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and xylazine (24 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and perfused transcardially with 10-ml PBS and 40 ml of 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences), as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Schaefer, A. et al.

First, a surface for plaques was generated. Next, microglia surfaces (processes) within 5 μm of the plaque surface were generated to select for plaque-associated microglia. We used this cutoff to select for microglia virtually touching the plaques. Finally, surfaces were generated for plaque-associated microglial nuclei. The number of nuclei per plaque, the surface area of plaques and the volume of plaques were calculated. The distal microglia were counted similarly for those more than 5 μm from the plaque surface. They were normalized to cortex volume minus total plaque volume. The total microglia numbers were calculated similarly. For volume calculations, the volume of the microglia surface was divided by the number of nuclei. For BODIPY quantification, a microglia surface was generated, and then a BODIPY&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; surface was generated within microglia. The volume of the BODIPY surface per microglia volume was calculated. &lt;i&gt;Mx1::GFP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;+&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; microglia were quantified manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bassoon and VGLUT2 density quantification, three to four stained sections from each sample containing the somatosensory cortex were imaged using a ZEISS Observer Spinning Disk Confocal microscope equipped with diode lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, 594 nm and 647 nm) and ZEN Blue acquisition software (ZEISS). Two to three randomly chosen ×63 fields of view within the somatosensory cortex were acquired with five &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack steps at 0.68 µm spacing for each hemisphere.

In brief, a consistent threshold range was first determined using sample images for each genotype and condition. All images were subjected to background subtraction. Then, single &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-planes of the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stacks (five &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-planes per animal) were subjected to the same background subtraction and thresholding. Finally, the total area of presynaptic inputs was measured from the thresholded images using the AnalyzeParticles function of ImageJ. Data from single &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-planes were averaged for each &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack of each field of view, and the mean of all fields of view from one animal was determined and normalized to control animals to assess changes in synaptic densities. For inhibitor experiments, manual thresholding, blinded to condition and genotype for each channel within one experiment, was performed (ISODATA segmentation method; 85–255).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For AT8 and HJ3.4–amyloid-β immunohistochemistry quantification, images were obtained from two to three sections per mouse. Slides were scanned on the NanoZoomer 2.0-HT system (Hamamatsu Photonics). The images were further processed using NDP viewing software (Hamamatsu Photonics) and Fiji software v.1.51 (National Institutes of Health).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 6E10–amyloid-β/ThioS ratio quantification from the hippocampus and subiculum, &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack images of approximately 20-μm thickness acquired with a ×40 objective at ×1 zoom were used to quantify the area of the respective signals in maximum intensity &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; projections in ImageJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For PU.1 immunofluorescence quantification by CellProfiler (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09662-z#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;e and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09662-z#Fig3"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;), approximately 20 μm of mouse brain tissue stained for PU.1, CD11B, DRAQ5 and ThioS was captured by &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-section confocal microscopy. The &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; sections were projected as summed slices and converted to 16-bit.

CellProfiler classified nuclei as belonging to microglia using FilterObjects if they exceeded an upper quartile intensity threshold in the CD11B stain and passed spatial form factor and eccentricity thresholds. To further constrain microglia nuclei, CellProfiler was used to generate a properties file containing DRAQ5 nuclei objects and the associated CD11B and DRAQ5 measurements. The classifier feature in CellProfiler Analyst v.3.0.4 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 75" title="Stirling, D.

A separate CellProfiler pipeline was then created to incorporate this classifier model under ClassifyObjects. Nuclear outlines were reduced in size for consistency. Microglial PU.1 values, merged images containing outlines and mean intensity measurements to allow visual inspection were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For PU.1 immunofluorescence quantification by Imaris (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09662-z#Fig1"&gt;1b,f&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09662-z#Fig6"&gt;1a,e&lt;/a&gt;), approximately 20 μm of mouse brain tissue from control, 5xFAD, 5xFAD;SYK-KO and 5xFAD–PLCγ2-KO, as well as PU.1-low and PU.1-high mice (as reference mice), stained for PU.1, IBA1, DRAQ5 and Thioflavin S, was captured using &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-section confocal microscopy. The &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; sections were analysed using Imaris software (Bitplane). First, a surface for IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia was generated, and the DRAQ5 nuclei channel was masked within this surface. Next, microglia nuclei were specifically detected by creating a surface for the masked DRAQ5 channel. The mean signal intensity for the PU.1 channel was measured within the microglia nuclei DRAQ5 surface. Low and high PU.1 cutoffs were defined on the basis of the fold change in mean PU.1 signal between nuclei from PU.1-high and PU.1-low microglia. The fold change (calculated as the mean PU.1 signal in PU.1-high nuclei divided by the mean PU.1 signal in PU.1-low nuclei) was determined to be 1.25. For each experiment, the high cutoff was set by multiplying and the low cutoff was set by dividing the mean PU.1 signal across all microglia of 6-month-old 5xFAD mice. Nuclei between these cutoffs were considered to have medium PU.1 signal. Quantifications represent the proportion of microglia within each of these PU.1 intensity categories normalized to the total number of microglia analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CD28 quantification, approximately 20 μm of mouse brain tissue stained for CD28, IBA1, DRAQ5 and ThioS was captured by &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-section confocal microscopy. The &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; sections were analysed using Imaris software (Bitplane). Microglia nuclei in each image were detected and counted using the Spots function. IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD28&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia were counted and normalized to the total number of microglia per image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Combined RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence of mouse tissue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situ hybridization was performed on 30-μm cryosectioned slides from 5xFAD;CD28-KO mice with sex-matched and age-matched littermate control 5xFAD mice using RNAscope probes for &lt;i&gt;Cd28&lt;/i&gt; (Advanced Cell Diagnostics; 1070671-C1) and &lt;i&gt;Mx1&lt;/i&gt; (Advanced Cell Diagnostics; 474931-C1) to label interferon-responsive cells, with the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2 according to the manufacturer’s recommendation for fixed-frozen tissue samples. After completing the in situ hybridization, sections were rinsed in PBST for 15 min and blocked in 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody IBA1 (1:1,000; Synaptic Systems; 234 009) to label microglia. Sections were washed three times with PBST for 10 min and incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-chicken; 1:500; conjugated to the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 488) and DAPI (1:10,000) to label nuclei for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed twice in PBST and once in PBS, dried, mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (P36930; Invitrogen) and dried overnight. &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-stack images were taken using a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope with 30-μm &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack confocal images acquired at 0.8-μm intervals and ×20 objective at ×1 zoom, and image processing was done using Fiji software. Microglia were identified by IBA1. &lt;i&gt;Cd28&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;+&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mx1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;+&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; microglia were manually identified by at least five dots (&lt;i&gt;Cd28&lt;/i&gt;) or three dots (&lt;i&gt;Mx1&lt;/i&gt;) of in situ signal within the microglia nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For MERFISH, we used two control (&lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;CreErt2/+(Litt)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), three 5xFAD (&lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;CreErt2/+(Litt)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt;5xFAD), two 5xFAD;PU.1-low (5xFAD;&lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;CreErt2/+(Litt)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spi1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;fl/+&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and one 5xFAD;PU.1-high (5xFAD;&lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;CreErt2/+(Litt)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;R26&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;FLAG-Spi1/+&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) male mice (8–10 months old). After sacrificing the mice, the brains were immediately placed in a cold O.C.T. Compound (Fisher; 23-730-571) and frozen. The samples were then processed following the Vizgen Fresh Frozen Tissue Sample Preparation protocol. Briefly, brains were sagittally sectioned into 10-µm-thick slices and placed on a functionalized coverslip covered with fluorescent beads (Vizgen; 20400001). Once the tissue adhered to the coverslip, we fixed the tissue (4% PFA in 1× PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS. After aspiration, we added 70% ethanol to permeabilize the tissue for 24 h at 4 °C. The samples were photobleached for 3 h in 70% ethanol (MERSCOPE Photobleacher; Vizgen; 10100003), followed by incubation with a blocking solution (Vizgen Blocking Buffer C premix; 20300100; and 10% RNase inhibitor; New England Biolabs; M0314L) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the samples were incubated with a primary antibody solution (purified azide-free anti-β-amyloid 6E10; 803004; BioLegend; and 1:100 plus 10:100 of RNase inhibitor; New England Biolabs; M0314L). The samples were washed three times with 1× PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody solution (Vizgen; Anti-Mouse Aux 4 20300101; and 1:100 plus 10:100 of RNase inhibitor; New England Biolabs; M0314L) for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were washed three times with 1× PBS, fixed (4% PFA in 1× PBS) for 15 min at room temperature and washed two times with 1× PBS. Following staining, the samples were incubated in formamide wash buffer (30% formamide in 2× saline–sodium citrate (SSC) buffer), and the MERFISH library mix was added and left for hybridization for 48 h. We then washed the samples twice and incubated them at 47 °C with formamide wash buffer. Then, the tissue was embedded in a polyacrylamide gel, followed by incubation overnight at 37 °C using a tissue clearing solution (2× SSC, 2% SDS, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 and 1:100 proteinase K). The tissue was washed (2× SSC) and incubated with DAPI and PolyT solution (Vizgen) for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslip was assembled into the imaging chamber and placed into the microscope for imaging. The MERSCOPE 500 gene imaging kit (Vizgen; 10400003) was activated by adding 250 μl of Imaging Buffer Activator (Vizgen; 203000015) and 100 μl of RNase Inhibitor (New England Biolabs; M0314L). Mineral oil (15 ml) was overlaid on top of the imaging buffer through the activation port. The instrument was primed, and the imaging chamber was assembled according to the MERSCOPE user guide. A ×10 low-resolution mosaic of the sample was acquired. The imaging area was then selected, and the sample was imaged. The settings for the MERSCOPE antibody image acquisition were set to high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following image acquisition, the resulting data were decoded using Vizgen’s analysis pipeline incorporated in MERSCOPE. Vizgen’s post-processing tool was then applied to obtain the cell segmentation on the basis of the DAPI staining using the Cellpose algorithm. Segmentation was performed on the middle &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; plane (fourth of seven), and cell borders were propagated to &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; planes above and below. The following gene sets have been used to identify cell types in the representative images: macrophage-identifying gene (&lt;i&gt;Mrc1&lt;/i&gt;), endothelial cell-identifying gene (&lt;i&gt;Cldn5&lt;/i&gt;), T cell-identifying genes (&lt;i&gt;Cd3e&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cd8a&lt;/i&gt;), microglia homeostatic genes (&lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; Tmem119&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P2ry12&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Csf1r&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hexb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aif1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tnf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Itgam&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C1qa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C1qb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C1qc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sall1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Selplg&lt;/i&gt;), neuron-identifying gene (&lt;i&gt;Meg3&lt;/i&gt;), oligodendrocyte-identifying genes (&lt;i&gt;Mog&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sox10&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mag&lt;/i&gt;), lymphoid genes (&lt;i&gt;Pdcd1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd274&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd28&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd72&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tnfsf13b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cd4&lt;/i&gt;) and DAM-identifying genes (&lt;i&gt;Itgax&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clec7a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Igf1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cst7&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spp1&lt;/i&gt;) (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09662-z#Fig8"&gt;3g&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Bioinformatics analysis of MERFISH data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-cell gene expression matrices were obtained by counting messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules within segmented cell boundaries and were further analysed in RStudio using R 4.2.2, Seurat 5.0.3 and custom-made scripts (&lt;a href="https://github.com/SchaferLabUMassChan/Ayata-et-al_2025"&gt;https://github.com/SchaferLabUMassChan/Ayata-et-al_2025&lt;/a&gt;). We excluded cells containing fewer than 40 transcripts or a volume of less than 100 µm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. To account for global differences in mRNA counts between samples, we normalized data to the total transcripts per cell of each sample. We then normalized the gene expression of each cell by its volume to compute counts per cubic micrometre. Cells with less than 11 unique genes were further excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For annotation of cell types and nearest-neighbour analysis relative to plaques, data from all samples were merged into a single Seurat object for clustering and cell type annotation following a modified Seurat pipeline. Data were normalized by dividing gene counts per cubic micrometre for each cell by the total count per cubic micrometre for that cell, multiplied by 10,000 and log-transformed. Data were then scaled, and the principal components were calculated on all 398 measured genes. Thirty-nine principal components were used to calculate the UMAP embedding and perform clustering analysis using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 2.4. Clusters were manually annotated on the basis of the spatial distribution of the cells in the tissue and expression of cell-type-specific marker genes. Owing to imperfections in cell boundary segmentation, a small fraction of cells expressed cell type markers for several cell types. Clusters composed of these ‘hybrid’ cells and clusters consisting of imaging artefacts were removed from the analysis. UMAP embedding and clustering analysis were iteratively repeated until all hybrid clusters were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglia sub-cluster analysis was performed using the same modified Seurat pipeline. Before the removal of clusters containing hybrids, all clusters expressing microglia cell type markers (&lt;i&gt;Tmem119&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hexb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P2ry12&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C1qa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;) were separated out and sub-clustered. Sub-clusters composed of hybrid cells and sub-clusters composed of border-associated macrophages (&lt;i&gt;Mrc1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lyve1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cd163&lt;/i&gt;) were removed from the analysis. Seventeen principal components were used to calculate the UMAP embedding and perform clustering analysis using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates of all amyloid-β plaques in the cortex of two 5xFAD MERFISH samples were manually recorded using MERSCOPE visualizer software (Vizgen) to visualize anti-β-amyloid 6E10 immunofluorescent signal. For each plaque, because plaques varied in size, 4 points along the perimeter were recorded. The &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates outlining the cortex were acquired by manual tracing in the MERSCOPE visualizer software (Vizgen) using DAPI signal and &lt;i&gt;Meg3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cux2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rorb&lt;/i&gt; transcripts as landmarks. For all microglia within the cortex, the distance between each microglia and the nearest plaque was calculated using a custom Python script (find_nearest_neighbors2.py). The nearest-neighbour distance was calculated as the distance between the centre of the microglia and the edge of the plaque (defined using four points around the perimeter of each plaque). Microglial nuclei within 15 µm of a plaque were defined as ‘plaque-associated’, whereas those further than 15 µm from the nearest plaque were defined as ‘distal’. We used a larger distance cutoff for nuclei to account for the soma and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MERFISH analysis plots were generated using Seurat 5.0.3 and scCustomize 3.0.1 R packages. MERFISH-processed data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and are publicly available as of the date of publication. Processed MERFISH.vzg files for browsing on MERSCOPE visualizer software (Vizgen) and the MERFISH raw output files are available upon request.

Frozen tissue was mechanically dissociated in glass homogenizers in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with protease and RNase inhibitors. The homogenate was filtered through a 70-μm mesh filter. Myelin removal was performed using Percoll (pH 7.4) density gradient separation. The homogenate was supplemented with 90% Percoll (17-0891-02; Amersham) with PBS (pH 7.4).

The frozen brain tissue (cortex or hippocampus) was resuspended in 1% SDS (Ambion) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche), sonicated at 4 °C using a Bioruptor on high-power 30-s on/30-s off cycles for a total of ten cycles and boiled for 10 min in 1× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 200 mM (Sigma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For protein preparation from cells, BV2 cells, iMgls, ex vivo microglia or T cells were centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The BV2 cells were detached from the culture plate using PBS + 2 mM EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, whereas the primary microglia required further scraping. Protein was lysed in cold RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 89900) with protease inhibitors (Roche; 11873580001), phosphatase inhibitors (Roche; 4906845001) and benzonase (MilliporeSigma; 71206) for 1 h on ice. Samples were then brought to 0.35 M NaCl, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and spun at 14,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was moved to a fresh tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein samples were diluted in equal volumes of 2× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and supplemented with DTT to a final concentration of 200 mM (Sigma). Protein samples (20–40 μg) or concentrated culture supernatant (100 μg) was separated on 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris precast denaturing gels or 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast denaturing gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For CD28 and PU.1 immunoblotting of primary microglia, NuPAGE Antioxidant (Invitrogen) was added to the running buffer. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)– or milk–TBST solution overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (GE; 1:10,000), anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (GE 1:10,000) or anti-sheep IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer) and exposed on film. Exposed films were scanned, and protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Protein quantities were normalized using β-actin or histone H3.

To visualize both microglia and T cells in a combined PCA space, the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were plotted using ggplot2 (v.3.3.5) with fixed axis scaling to preserve relative distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcription factor motif enrichment was done using HOMER (v.4.10). The findMotifsGenome.pl tool was applied to significant peaks within 200 bp around the peak summit using the parameter −size 200. Motifs were considered on the basis of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;).

Briefly, the brain tissue was thawed in an ice-cold Wheaton 33 low extractable borosilicate glass homogenizer containing 1-ml cell lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.3), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of cycloheximide and 10 μl ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of RNasin (Promega) and SUPERase·In (Invitrogen).

The samples were then transferred to chilled Eppendorf tubes. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 2,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. NP-40 (final concentration of 1%) and DHPC (final concentration of 30 mM) were added to the supernatant. A post-mitochondrial supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C.

Brain regions were quickly dissected and frozen immediately. The frozen cortex tissue was homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 20 mM tricine (pH 7.8), supplemented with protease and RNase inhibitors with a glass Dounce homogenizer (1984-10002; Kimble Chase). The buffers were supplemented with 10 μl ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of RNasin, SUPERase·In and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (11836170001; Roche). The homogenate was then spun through a 29% iodixanol cushion. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 20 mM tricine (pH 7.8), supplemented with 10 μM DyeCycle Ruby (V10304; Invitrogen) and 10% donkey serum (017-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Microglial nuclei were sorted in a BD FACSAria Cell Sorter by gating for the lowest DyeCycle Ruby, which indicates nuclei singlets and a high GFP signal. For single-nucleus RNA-seq, isolated nuclei were used immediately. More than 10,000 nuclei were used for 10× sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Microglia-specific single-cell and single-nucleus sequencing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the Chromium platform (10x Genomics) with the 3′ gene expression v.2 kit with a targeted input of 5,000 nuclei or cells per sample on average. In brief, gel bead in emulsions (GEMs) were generated on the sample chip in the Chromium controller. Barcoded cDNA was extracted from GEMs using Post GEM-RT Cleanup and amplified for 12 cycles. The amplified cDNA was fragmented and subjected to end-repair, poly-A-tailing, adaptor ligation and 10x-specific sample indexing following the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were quantified using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) analyses and then sequenced in paired-end mode on a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina) targeting a depth of 50,000–100,000 reads per nucleus per cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Bioinformatics analysis of single-cell and single-nucleus sequencing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raw read data were demultiplexed, aligned and analysed using 10x Cell Ranger (v.2.1.0). To capture the unspliced pre-mRNA in the single-nucleus RNA expression assay, intronic regions in the 10x Cell Ranger mm10 v.1.2.0 reference were marked as exonic, as suggested by 10x for pre-mRNA reference generation. Data from two experiments were used to generate Seurat objects in R. Quality control cutoffs (nFeature of more than 1,500; pct.mt of less than 5) were used to generate final datasets. The following clustering pipeline steps were applied: NormalizeData(), FindVariableFeatures(), ScaleData(), RunPCA(), FindNeighbors() and FindClusters().

Data normalization and scaling were performed using the Seurat default parameters and included regression of UMI counts to account for technical noise. Subsequently, variable features were identified, and clustering was performed using the default Seurat settings, with a final resolution of 0.6 to determine cluster identities. Clusters were visualized using UMAP. Gene set module scores were computed per cell using the AddModuleScore function in Seurat to assess the relative expression of predefined gene sets, DAM, homeostatic and lymphoid genes (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09662-z#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). Clusters were categorized into two main groups (homeostatic and DAM) on the basis of the average ratio of DAM to homeostatic module scores. The DAM group was further subdivided on the basis of the expression of lymphoid marker genes. DAM clusters were categorized as either lymphoid-positive or lymphoid-negative, depending on the levels of lymphoid-related gene expression. Finally, gene expression patterns and functional module scores across clusters were visualized using dot plots and UMAP projections to identify and compare gene signatures associated with different microglial clusters.

Brains were rapidly removed and chilled in cutting artificial CSF (ACSF) containing choline chloride (93 mM), HCl (93 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1.2 mM), NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (30 mM), HEPES (20 mM), glucose (25 mM), sodium ascorbate (5 mM), thiourea (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (10 mM) and CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0.5 mM; pH 7.4). The brains were embedded in 2% agarose, and coronal slices (400 µm thick) were made using a Compresstome (Precisionary Instruments). Brain slices were then allowed to recover at 32 ± 1 °C in cutting solution for 5 min and after that at room temperature in holding ACSF containing NaCl (92 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1.2 mM), NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (30 mM), HEPES (20 mM), glucose (25 mM), sodium ascorbate (5 mM), thiourea (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2 mM; pH 7.4). After at least 2 h of recovery, the slices were transferred to a submersion recording chamber and continuously perfused (2–4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) with ACSF containing NaCl (124 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1.2 mM), NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (24 mM), HEPES (5 mM), glucose (12.5 mM), MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (2 mM) and CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2 mM; pH 7.4). Slices were allowed to recover for another hour in the recording chamber before recording the baseline. All the solutions were continuously bubbled with 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and recordings were obtained at 25 ± 1 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bipolar stimulating electrode was positioned in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were evoked by square-wave 50-µs pulses delivered every 30 s by MultiClamp 7b (Molecular Devices), and current was set to 50% of the maximum field excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude using ISO-Flex (ampi). A recording electrode, filled with ACSF (2–4 MΩ), was placed in the stratum radiatum a few millimetres away from the stimulating electrode. LTP was induced using a theta-burst protocol: four trains, separated by 10 s, each comprised five bursts of four stimuli delivered at 100 Hz, with 200 ms between the bursts. Data were acquired using a MultiClamp 7B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz and analysed using pCLAMP 11 software (Molecular Devices). LTP was quantified as a percentage change in excitatory postsynaptic potential slope from baseline (the last 10 min of a 30-min baseline period).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Behavioural assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioural analyses used sex-matched control, 5xFAD and 5xFAD;PU.1-low mice (9–10 months old). All behavioural analyses were performed within the 0700–1900 hours light cycle. All experiments were conducted in a blinded manner, and genotypes were decoded only after data processing and analysis. The mice were habituated to the testing room for at least 1 h before the experiment. All procedures followed the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software; v.9.0) was used for statistical data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec43"&gt;Open field&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locomotion and exploratory behaviour were measured using the open-field assay, as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Ayata, P. et al.

Open-field activity was quantified using Fusion software (Omnitech Electronics). The mice were recorded for 60 min, and chambers were thoroughly cleaned with ethanol between rounds. Anxiety was assessed by measuring the total time spent in the centre of the open-field box for the first 10 min of the 60-min recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec44"&gt;Novel object recognition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were habituated to a three-room novel object box for 20 min without objects. During the training trial, the mice were placed in the box containing two identical objects and allowed to explore for 10 min. They were then returned to their home cage for a 1-h inter-test interval. During the testing trial, the mice were placed in the box containing one familiar object from the training phase and one novel object. Between each round, the box was thoroughly cleaned with ethanol. Videos of each session were measured using EthoVision video-tracking software (Noldus Information Technology). Blinded manual scoring was performed for the time spent sniffing the familiar and novel objects. Recognition score was calculated as the percentage of time spent sniffing the novel object relative to the total time spent sniffing either object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec45"&gt;Survival&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control, 5xFAD, 5xFAD;PU1-low and 5xFAD;PU.1-high mice were monitored for survival and evaluated for health status at least once per week starting at tamoxifen induction (4–6 weeks of age) and continuing until death. Mice that were used for the experiments or died from environmental factors (such as cage flooding) were censored and excluded from death rate calculations. Both male and female mice were included in the study. No sex-specific differences in survival outcomes were observed; therefore, data from both sexes were pooled for analysis. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and statistical differences between groups were assessed using log-rank (Mantel–Cox) tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics were analysed using GraphPad Prism v.5.01, with significance determined as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05. All statistical analyses were two-tailed. Normal distribution was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Grubbs’s test was used to identify outliers. Variance was determined using the &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;-test. An unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test was used for normally distributed datasets with two independent samples. For normally distributed datasets with two dependent samples (for example, plaque-associated and distal microglia from the same mice), we used a paired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test. For normally distributed datasets with more than two samples, we used one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. Normally distributed data with unequal variance were analysed using Welch’s correction. Non-normally distributed data involving two samples were analysed using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-test. Non-normally distributed data involving more than two samples were analysed using a two-tailed Kruskal–Wallis test. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes were similar to those generally used in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec47"&gt;Sample sizes, data exclusion, replication, randomization and blinding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did not include a justification of the sample size for this study. We used the minimum number of animals needed to reliably detect the expected effect size with an alpha rate of 0.05 in a standardly powered experiment and on the basis of extensive laboratory experience and literature in the field. There were further practical constraints related to the availability of samples and appropriate controls in the in vitro experiments, such as primary cell yield from animals and limitations in treatment or read-out methods, such as siRNA treatment or mass spectrometry. For human studies, the limiting factor was high-quality sample availability. These considerations collectively informed our sample size, which we deemed sufficient to observe biologically meaningful trends within the context of the aims of the study. Sample sizes are sufficient to detect significant changes on the basis of previous studies that used similar methodologies and experimental designs in the field. Data were formally excluded only if identified as a statistically significant outlier by Grubbs’s outlier test. Any outliers identified by Grubbs’s test were removed from the dataset, and the test was iterated until no outliers were detected. All replication attempts were successful. Each experiment was reproduced with similar results. Reproducibility is either indicated in the figure legends or shown as a quantification. For all experiments involving treatment with CSF1R or PLCi, animals or tissue culture wells were randomly assigned to groups. In other experiments, the mice were allocated into groups on the basis of either genotype or age. We did not compare human populations (control versus AD) but rather only within individuals with AD. The experimenters were blinded during the imaging and behavioural experiments. Gene expression and western blot analyses were not conducted under blinded conditions because they rely on quantitative read-outs, which lack subjectivity and are not influenced by knowledge of the experimental condition. Samples were processed either under blinded conditions or in batches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec48"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09662-z#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:06:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE4ySDE1amYybWgyQXVBeDV5Y3VQZks3SmkxVklTdUZYS0FwTld1SnNvdUQ1RzlGSVdYUjgwMU1oQVdzMkZBWmt0ZDRjTVhOaUtRcGVEMnBKMXZPS3FHcF8w</guid></item><item><title>用于MRI分割的人脑概率组织学图谱- Nature</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09708-2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec10-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11"&gt;Brain specimens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemispheres from five individuals (including half of the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem), were used in this study, following informed consent to use the tissue for research and the ethical approval for research by the National Research Ethics Service Committee London - Central.

First, each hemisphere was split into cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem. Using a metal frame as a guide, these were subsequently cut into 10-mm-thick slices in coronal, sagittal and axial orientation, respectively. These slices were photographed inside a rectangular frame of known dimensions for pixel size and perspective correction; we refer to these images as ‘whole slice photographs’. Although the brainstem and cerebellum slices all fit into the cassettes, the cerebrum slices were further cut into as many blocks as needed. ‘Blocked slice photographs’ were also taken for these blocks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09708-2#Fig1"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;, left).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec15"&gt;Tissue processing and sectioning&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;After standard tissue processing steps, each tissue block was embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned with a sledge microtome at 25-μm thickness. Before each cut, a photograph was taken with a 24 MPx Nikon D5100 camera (ISO = 100, aperture = f/20, shutter speed = automatic) mounted right above the microtome, pointed perpendicularly to the sectioning plane. These photographs (henceforth ‘blockface photographs’) were corrected for pixel size and perspective using fiducial markers. The blockface photographs have poor contrast between grey and white matter (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09708-2#Fig1"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;, right) but also negligible nonlinear geometric distortion, so they can be readily stacked into 3D volumes.

The CNN was then run on the (sparse) sections and the outputs manually corrected. This procedure saves a substantial amount of time, because manually tracing the convoluted shape of the arbor vitae is extremely time consuming. For the cortical cerebrum blocks, we used a similar strategy as for the cerebellum, labelling the tissue as either white or grey matter. The subdivision of the cortical grey matter into parcels was achieved by taking the nearest neighbouring cortical label from the aligned MRI scan (details on the alignment below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manual labelling followed neuroanatomical protocols based on different brain atlases, depending on the brain region.

For this purpose, we used a framework with four modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec20"&gt;Initial blockface alignment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To roughly initialize the 3D reconstruction, we relied on the stacks of blockface photographs. Specifically, we used our previously presented hierarchical joint registration framework&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Mancini, M. et al.

The similarity transforms allowed for rigid deformation (rotation, translation), as well as isotropic scaling to model the shrinking due to tissue processing. The registration algorithm was initialized with transforms derived from the whole slice, blocked slice and blockface photographs (see details in ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 26" title="Mancini, M. et al.

The registration was hierarchical in the sense that groups of transforms were forced to share the same parameters in the earlier iterations of the optimization, to reflect our knowledge of the cutting procedure. In the first iterations, we clustered the blocks into three groups: cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem. In the following iterations, we clustered the cerebral blocks that were cut from the same slice and allowed translations in all directions, in-plane rotation and global scaling. In the final iterations, each block alignment was optimized independently. The numerical optimization used the LBFGS algorithm&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Liu, D.

The approximate average error after this procedure was about 2 mm (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Mancini, M. et al.

A sample 3D reconstruction is shown in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09708-2#Fig1"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Refined alignment with preliminary nonlinear model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a good initial alignment is available, we can use the LFB sections to refine the registration. These LFB images have exquisite contrast (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09708-2#Fig1"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;) but suffer from nonlinear distortion—rendering the good initialization from the blockface images crucial. The registration procedure was nearly identical to that of the blockface, with two main differences. First, the similarity term used the local (rather than global) normalized cross-correlation function&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Avants, B. B., Epstein, C. L., Grossman, M. &amp;amp; Gee, J. C. Symmetric diffeomorphic image registration with cross-correlation: evaluating automated labeling of elderly and neurodegenerative brain. Med. Image Anal. 12, 26–41 (2008)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09708-2#ref-CR64" id="ref-link-section-d72705631e2270"&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to handle uneven staining across sections. Second, the deformation model and optimization hierarchy were slightly different because nonlinear registration benefits from more robust methods. Specifically, the first two levels of optimization were the same, with blocks grouped into cerebrum/cerebellum/brainstem (first level) or cerebral slices (second level) and optimization of similarity transforms. The third level (that is, each block independently) was subdivided into four stages in which we optimized transforms with increasing complexity, such that the solution of every level of complexity served as initialization to the next. In the first and simplest stage, we allowed for translations in all directions, in-plane rotation and global scaling (five parameters per block). In the second stage, we added a different scaling parameter in the normal direction of the block (six parameters per block). In the third stage, we allowed for rotation in all directions (eight parameters per block). In the fourth and final stage, we added to every section in every block a nonlinear field modelled with a grid of control points (10-mm spacing) and interpolating B-splines. This final deformation model has about 100,000 parameters per case (about 100 parameters per section, times about 1,000 LFB sections).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Nonlinear artificial intelligence registration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We seek to produce final nonlinear registrations that are accurate, consistent with each other and robust against tears and folds in the sections.

This method follows an overconstrained strategy by computing registrations between LFB and MRI, H&amp;amp;E and MRI, H&amp;amp;E and LFB, each LFB section and the two nearest neighbours in either direction across the stack, each H&amp;amp;E section and its neighbours, and each MRI slice and its neighbours. For a stack with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; sections, this procedure yields 15&lt;i&gt;xS-18&lt;/i&gt; registrations, whereas the underlying dimensionality of the spanning tree connecting all the images is just 3x&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-1. We use a probabilistic model of SVFs to infer the most likely spanning tree given the computed registrations, which are seen as noisy measurements of combinations of transforms in the spanning tree. The probabilistic model uses a Laplace distribution, which relies on L1 norms and is thus robust to outliers.

From that point on, the algorithm operates exclusively on the segmentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every iteration of the atlas construction process comprises two steps. First, the current estimate of the atlas and the segmentations are coregistered one at a time using (1) a diffeomorphic deformation model based on SVFs parameterized by grids of control points and B-splines (as implemented in NiftyReg&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 72" title="Modat, M. et al.

The second step of each iteration updates the atlas by averaging the segmentations. The procedure converged (negligible change in the atlas) after five iterations.

In short, the algorithm jointly estimates a set of parameters that best explain the observed image in light of the probabilistic atlas, according to a generative model based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) conditioned on the segmentation, combined with a model of bias field. The parameters include the deformation of the probabilistic atlas; a set of coefficients describing the bias field; and the means, variances and weights of the GMM. The atlas deformation is regularized in the same way as the atlas construction (bending energy, in our case) and is estimated by means of numerical optimization with LBFGS.

                    &lt;p&gt;Clustering ROIs into tissue types (rather than letting each ROI have its own Gaussian) is particularly important, given the large number of ROIs (333). The user can specify the clustering by means of a configuration file; by default, our public implementation uses a configuration with 15 tissue types, tailored to in vivo MRI segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The framework is implemented using the PyTorch package, which enables it to run on graphics processing units and curbs segmentation run times to about half an hour per hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

First, we downsampled the data to 200-μm resolution and discarded the left hemisphere, to alleviate the manual labelling requirements. Next, we used Freeview to manually label from scratch one coronal slice of every ten; we labelled as many regions from the histological protocol as the MRI contrast allowed—without subdividing the cortex.

Next, we manually corrected the SmartInterpol output as needed, until we were satisfied with the 200-μm isotropic segmentation. The cortex was subdivided using standard FreeSurfer routines.

This version was created by replacing the brainstem labels in the histological 3D reconstruction (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09708-2#Fig1"&gt;1g&lt;/a&gt;, right) by new segmentations made directly in the underlying MRI scan.

Leaving out one subject at a time, we used all other subjects to (1) compute linear regression coefficients to correct for sex and age (intracranial volume was corrected by division); (2) estimate mean vectors for the two classes &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(({{\mathbf{\upmu }}}_{0},{{\mathbf{\upmu }}}_{1})\)&lt;/span&gt;, as well as a pooled covariance matrix (&lt;i&gt;Σ&lt;/i&gt;); and (3) use the means and covariance to compute an unbiased log-likehood criterion &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; for the left-out subject:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$L({\bf{x}})={({{\mathbf{\upmu }}}_{1}-{{\mathbf{\upmu }}}_{0})}^{t}\,{{\Sigma }}^{-1}[{\bf{x}}-0.5\,({{\mathbf{\upmu }}}_{1}+{{\mathbf{\upmu }}}_{0})],$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt; is the vector with ICV-, sex- and age-corrected volumes for the left-out subject. Once the criterion &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; has been computed for all subjects, it can be globally thresholded for accuracy and ROC analysis. We note that, for NextBrain, the high number of ROIs renders the covariance matrix singular. We prevent this by using regularized LDA: we normalize all the ROIs to unit variance and then compute the covariance as &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\Sigma =S+{\rm{\lambda }}I,\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; is the sample covariance, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; is the identity matrix and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\rm{\lambda }}=1.0\)&lt;/span&gt; is a constant. We note that normalizing to unit variance enables us to use a fixed, unit λ—rather than having to estimate λ for every left-out subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;B-spline fitting of ageing trajectories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compute the B-spline fits in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09708-2#Fig13"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, we first corrected the ROI volumes by sex (using regression) and intracranial volume (by division). Next, we modelled the data with a Laplace distribution, which is robust against outliers which may be caused by potential segmentation mistakes. Specifically, we used an age-dependent Laplacian where the location &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; and scale &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; are both B-splines with four evenly space control points at 30, 51.6, 73.3 and 95 years.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pumpkin seeds also contain &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/phytic-acid-5088824" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phytic acid&lt;/a&gt;, an "anti-nutrient" that can bind to minerals and make them harder to absorb.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grinding them—particularly when combined with soaking or roasting—can lower phytic acid levels and improve how well your body absorbs nutrients, said Janelle Connell, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and translational science nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://www.viome.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Viome&lt;/a&gt;.

It Helps Your Body Digest Protein and Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pumpkin seeds are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/non-meat-protein-sources-8743898" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/healthy-fats-7498653" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Grinding them makes it easier for your body to access and absorb these nutrients as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “What’s happening in the body is essentially pre-digestion,” said Connell. “Grinding mechanically breaks down food so enzymes can work faster.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The payoff: You’ll absorb more of the nutrients in pumpkin seeds, helping you stay energized and satisfied longer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-its-gentler-on-the-gut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. It’s Gentler on the Gut &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If whole seeds sometimes leave you feeling bloated or uncomfortable, grinding can help, said Connell. Smaller seed particles move through the digestive tract more easily and are less likely to irritate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “People who don’t chew thoroughly, have dental issues, or find whole seeds tough on the stomach may do better with ground seeds,” said Connell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You still get the &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/dietary-fiber-7496057" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;benefits of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps with digestion and regularity, but without the heaviness that can come from large, undigested seed pieces, added Routhenstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grinding pumpkin seeds can also make them &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-improve-gut-health-11712148" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;more beneficial to your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You also make the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber and polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; more available to gut microbes,” said Connell. “That can support the production of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/short-chain-fatty-acids-5219806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;short-chain fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; that benefit the gut lining and overall metabolic health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Short-chain fatty acids are compounds made when your gut bacteria ferment fiber.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-its-an-easy-nutrition-upgrade"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. It’s an Easy Nutrition Upgrade &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grinding pumpkin seeds doesn’t require fancy equipment or meal prep. Just toss them in a coffee grinder or blender, and you’ve got a nutrient-packed powder that works in almost anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Connell suggested adding one to two tablespoons of freshly ground pumpkin seeds to yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies, or soups. The healthy fats and protein help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ways-to-keep-your-blood-sugar-stable-all-day-11767965" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilize blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and keep you full, while the mild, nutty flavor plays well with both sweet and savory foods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She also recommended grinding small batches at a time. “The healthy fats are delicate,” said Connell. “Store the ground seeds in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer to limit oxidation and preserve flavor."&lt;br&gt;

And you'd likely be horrified if someone deliberately smeared dirt and grime all over your &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com/DD2502BV" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;beautiful, brand-new carpet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you're allowing people to wear shoes inside your home, you might as well be inviting these problems. Whether you realize it or not, your footwear can carry serious health risks and cost you a lot in flooring repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are seven reasons why a "no shoes" policy might be a smart move for your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You're bringing in a lot of germs to the home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put this at the top of your list of reasons to not wear shoes in your house: It's making you sick. Dr. Charles Gerba, professor of microbiology and environmental sciences at the University of Arizona, told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/home/health-reasons-why-you-shouldn-t-wear-shoes-house-t129820" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;TODAY Home&lt;/a&gt; just how disgusting the bottoms of your shoes can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you wear shoes for more than a month, 93 percent will have fecal bacteria on the bottom of them," Gerba said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, your shoes likely have either human or animal waste on them. This happens when you unwittingly step on pet droppings (your own pet's or someone else's) or use a public restroom with, well, pretty filthy floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from waste, Gerba's research team also found E. coli on the bottoms of shoes. If you're lucky, it might be a harmless strain. If not, you could be looking at a nasty bout of diarrhea, a urinary tract infection, respiratory illness or pneumonia, to name a few potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerba added that even if your shoes look clean, these germs can be lurking in the cracks and crevices, where bacteria easily breeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You're tracking in toxins, too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it sounds less gross, this next problem is even more deadly: Your shoes could be tracking in some dangerous toxins, such as lead or pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most common place we find lead is in older houses and buildings with lead-based paint," Dr. Daniel Sullivan tells &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/wearing-shoes-in-the-house-is-a-bad-idea" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. "Over time, that paint chips off and lands on the ground, where it turns to dust. You can walk through this dust without knowing it and bring it into your house on your shoes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suddenly becomes a very serious problem if you have small children who play or crawl on your floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don't forget about allergens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though slightly less scary than toxins, allergens can also make your life miserable at home if your shoes bring them inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tree, grass and weed pollen easily get on shoes," Dr. Sullivan says, "and when you walk around your house, the pollen can fly into the air, land on surfaces and aggravate your allergies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It creates a mess&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An obvious reason to not wear shoes in your home is the mess it makes. Any parent knows how aggravating it is to spend a day sweeping and mopping your floors only to have your kids streak dirt and debris inside when they get home from school. A no shoe policy can nip this bad habit in the bud really quickly and spare you of extra housework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It's a sign of disrespect in many cultures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing shoes indoors may not seem like a big deal to you, but in some cultures, it's very offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wearing shoes inside someone's house is seen as a sign of disrespect in many cultures throughout Asia, Europe, and the Middle East," Melanie Mannarino writes for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/shoes-inside-house" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a guest, it's best to take cues from your host about whether shoes are welcome inside. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Going shoeless is cozier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you have a specific orthopedic need for wearing shoes inside, taking them off is generally far more comfortable. You instantly feel at ease and it sends a message to your brain that you've entered a safe and relaxing place, allowing you to disconnect from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, many studies out there support the idea that walking barefoot comes with a host of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having direct skin contact with the earth's surface, known as grounding, may transmit electrical charges to the body and elicit positive results," Kim Grundy writes for &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/musculoskeletal/benefits-of-walking-barefoot?label_override=undefined" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4378297/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;PubMed Centra&lt;/a&gt;l found that the practice of grounding improved mood and energy for a group of massage therapists. In some cases, it helped reduce pain and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Adobe.com/Pixel-Shot&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It wreaks havoc on your flooring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you're a fan of matted, discolored and germ-infested carpet, going shoeless is a smart choice. It's no secret that shoes can wreak havoc on your floors, and carpet, in particular, takes a serious hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does it make your flooring look worn and dirty, but it also traps those germs, toxins and allergens mentioned earlier, creating an unhealthy environment beneath your feet.

When you're waiting in line, stuck in traffic, or awaiting the results of a test you are likely to feel your stress levels start to creep up. In addition to feeling anxious in understandably stressful situations, nearly one in five Americans also have an anxiety disorder, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Alliance on Mental Illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/a&gt;, making it the most common mental health concern in the US. But how can you distinguish between occasional feelings of anxiety and anxiety that may require treatment? Knowing the physical symptoms of anxiety is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're experiencing anxiety, you may feel irritable, tired, restless, and simply out of balance, according to &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/749434-david-arthur-merrill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Merrill, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Merrill, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA. While these feelings are easy to associate with anxiety, physical symptoms that mimic a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a31698322/coronavirus-vs-flu-vs-allergies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cold, flu, allergies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cold, flu, allergies&lt;/a&gt;, or even a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/life/a22789047/hangover-cures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hangover;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hangover&lt;/a&gt; are not—even though they could be connected. Dr. Merrill said that these mental and physical symptoms may be linked in an ongoing cycle of anxiety. For example, anxiety could cause digestive problems, and those effects could, in turn, worsen your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/749434-david-arthur-merrill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Merrill, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Merrill, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1134283468/joseph-d-laino" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Joseph Laino, Psy.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Joseph Laino, Psy.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist and clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, mental health experts share the most common physical ways that your body can manifest anxiety, plus how to address these symptoms and the anxiety behind them so you can feel better fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Physical symptoms of anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Rapid heart rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is part of the body’s built-in alarm system, alerting us to danger in the surrounding environment, according to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1134283468/joseph-d-laino" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Joseph Laino, Psy.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Joseph Laino, Psy.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist and clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A part of the brain called the amygdala rings that alarm during a perceived threat and it causes a cascade of effects—such as a surge of the hormones cortisol and adrenaline—meant to prep us to flee or fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can increase your heart rate and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a30915774/what-causes-high-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and even lead to heart palpitations, Dr. Laino said. “That reaction is essential to our health and preservation, because a surge of anxiety can propel us to move quickly,” he explained. But when that alarm button seems stuck in the “on” position, it can exacerbate these reactions, which are designed to be temporary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Chills or sweating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the fight-or-flight response, you may experience a sudden temperature change, Dr. Merrill said. That’s because another part of the brain involved in anxiety is the hypothalamus, which regulates body heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of that, you could have chills, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20484754/6-common-causes-of-hot-flashes-that-arent-menopause/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:feel drenched in sweat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;feel drenched in sweat&lt;/a&gt;, or weirdly, both at the same time. That effect could also come from the way muscles fire up during an anxiety response, he added, as one more way to get you ready to take on threats. That’s why you may have odd &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a22586222/body-aches-causes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:muscle aches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;muscle aches&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with the hot or cold flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Shortness of breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your heart and lungs work in concert to keep you going strong, so when one is affected, the other is likely to be, too. If you’re experiencing a sudden rise in heart rate, that could lower your oxygen intake and your lungs see that as a tip-off to power up, so they start working harder, Dr. Merrill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is why, in extreme anxiety—like a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a19863296/panic-attack-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:panic attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;panic attack&lt;/a&gt;—you’ll not only have a rapid heart rate, but also shortness of breath, and the advice with those is to try and implement deep breathing so that both can get corrected,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you’re having chest pains, the symptoms don’t subside, or it feels worse after a few minutes, seek immediate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Nausea or indigestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the parts of the brain and certain hormones being associated with anxiety, the central nervous system plays a major role in the stress response as well. Dr. Merrill noted that there are more nerve fibers in the gut than anywhere else in the body. That’s why, when you feel excited, you have those butterflies—it’s your nervous system responding to stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hormone, serotonin, steps in here as well, he added. Most of your serotonin—the “happy chemical” that send signals between nerve cells—is in your gut, and when emotional distress happens, it can throw off your nerve signaling and serotonin response. The result? Belly problems. “Any kind of emotional imbalance like anxiety is likely to create stomach issues, such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a46706659/how-to-ease-nausea-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nausea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt;, indigestion, and upset stomach,” Dr. Merrill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Constipation or diarrhea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the body prepares to respond to a threat, it shuttles resources like blood flow to what it considers necessary for short-term mobilization. What’s not needed when you’re in the middle of a fight or you’re sprinting away from danger? Digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As your blood flows toward muscles, vision, and hearing to react to threats, your motility can change,” said Dr. Merrill. That often results in &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a30896279/constipation-symptoms-causes-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; but can also swing in the other direction toward diarrhea. In some cases, you may toggle between the two. Related effects can include &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20472936/best-remedies-for-gas-and-bloating/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bloating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a29542143/smelly-farts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excessive gas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;excessive gas&lt;/a&gt;, abdominal pain, and cramping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Tingling, sharp pains, and tightness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrill explained that because the central nervous system is connected to the peripheral nervous system, when there’s anxiety in the brain, it sends out signals all along the connections throughout your body. Much like your muscles, heart, and lungs are prepped for a threat, your nerves fire up to ensure the rest of your body is ready to jump or punch, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because your nerves are activated, that can create an effect anywhere along those nerve systems,” said Dr. Merrill. “You may have &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a32631827/tingling-in-feet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tingling fingers or toes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tingling fingers or toes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or the hairs on your arms stand up like you’re scared.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a nerve fires suddenly, there could be sharp pain or tightness as well—especially in areas where the nerves are in tighter clusters, like your lower back, jaw, or neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to deal with your symptoms and ease your anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So once you start to notice and recognize physical manifestations of your anxiety, what should you do about them? For starters, mindfulness-based practices can help, especially if they involve some type of physical movement that benefits both body and mind. Dr. Merrill suggested &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g30417941/best-yoga-stretches/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yoga;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; or tai chi, for example, because they incorporate breathwork and movement in their practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of treatment, Dr. Laino suggested talking with your healthcare provider about both your symptoms and anxiety as a possible cause to ensure you’re getting an accurate diagnosis from a trained professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all, take it seriously. “Just because a symptom is linked to anxiety doesn’t mean it should be ignored,” Dr. Laino said. “There are various medications and talk therapies that can help people who suffer with acute, chronic, or post-traumatic anxieties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of all, as your anxiety knots get loosened, it’s likely many of your physical issues will start to ease as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:51:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQckNFOXZxZnE4ejNFQU1qVXRTczZfMm1YOEF3T0tBSWlYb05kTUxOU0dteENYczE0QzBhUkt1djFCQ2NlNzR4LWxOZlUzbDVvbmJvZm82ekV1Q1NYbV9ySlh1MWJ4RXZjYWtsazV0UVY1a3Zwd1AxejFrbHJOYk9ub2c2cW1XWm9BMnc</guid></item><item><title>这台机器可以让婴儿在子宫外存活。世界将如何决定使用它？ |婴幼儿死亡率-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/baby-alive-outside-womb</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;eth Schafer lay in a hospital bed, bracing for the birth of her son. The first contractions rippled through her body before she felt remotely ready. She knew, with a mother’s pit-of-the-stomach intuition, that her baby was not ready either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At just 23 weeks of gestation, her son teetered on the cliff edge of viability, the fragile threshold where modern medicine offers any promise of keeping babies alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beth’s son did not – could not – cry when he was born. The instant his entire body, small enough to cradle in a single palm, landed in the delivering doctor’s latexed hand, a swarm of blue scrubs closed in to begin resuscitation. But despite their fervent attempts to triage, to coax air into his tiny, caved-in lungs, they could not supply what Beth’s son needed most: more time in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beth is a 39-year-old painter turned graphic designer whose round frames and dark, frenzied bangs give her the look of an art student who never outgrew the studio. She will make you a mug of tea before you think to ask, the kind of person who says “I love that for you” and means every syllable. This is why I know she is not hyperbolizing when she talks about her perfect, precious son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I would have moved mountains for him,” Beth tells me, two years after his birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;This kind of device would create a new stage of human development, something we’ve never had to describe or regulate before&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists worldwide are racing to buy more time for extremely premature babies like Beth’s. In 2017, researchers in Philadelphia unveiled an experimental lifeline: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15112" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an artificial womb&lt;/a&gt;, engineered to gestate babies outside the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In their study’s photos, fetal lambs floated inside what looked like overgrown Ziploc bags, eyes closed and hearts pumping as if they had never left their mothers. That prototype was only tested on animals, but the technology is edging closer to human use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In September 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration convened an advisory committee to consider whether to greenlight the first clinical trials. If approved, the first candidates will be babies like Beth’s son, those born between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation, or less than two-thirds of the way to full term. (FDA representatives declined to comment on whether or when these trials might begin.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00147-8/fulltext#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2044%2C628%2C827%20infant,had%20higher%20survival%20than%20White" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than 10,000 infants&lt;/a&gt; are born each year within these precarious boundaries. Premature birth remains the nation’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/infant-mortality/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;second-leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of infant death, and even those who survive may face crippling complications, from chronic lung disease to lifelong neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Artificial wombs promise to change that trajectory, saving more babies and sparing more parents from grief. But growing a child outside the body also cuts to the core of how people imagine pregnancy and parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This kind of device would create a new stage of human development, something we’ve never had to describe or regulate before,” says Elizabeth Chloe Romanis, a medical law scholar at Durham University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In this way, artificial wombs tug at a taut tightrope of questions that scientists, bioethicists and legal experts are scrambling to cross before human trials begin: how will this technology affect the ways we intervene in preserving life, or how we define life itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When I first see the prototype, I don’t think of a womb. I think of an aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The glass tank rests on a waist-high platform in a bright laboratory in Aachen, Germany, one of the sites affiliated with AquaWomb, a Dutch startup that is developing devices to improve health outcomes for the smallest, sickest infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About the size of a household fishtank, the vessel sits under fluorescent lights so technicians can monitor every movement inside, though in practice it would be covered to mimic the dimness of the womb. Tubes coil from the sides into filters that cycle synthetic amniotic fluid in rhythmic glugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The design feels apt for extremely premature infants, who often arrive looking as though they belong to another world entirely – skin translucent and gelatinous, limbs thin as matchsticks. In this tank, those babies could float, drink, urinate and grow without touching air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5538b886-a38b-49d5-9f0d-161271e94adc" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Replica premature babies.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van Overbeeke&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Myrthe van der Ven, a technical physician and the co-founder and CEO of AquaWomb, shows me how their prototype mimics the constant shelter of pregnancy. The amniotic fluid holds at 99.7F, just above a mother’s core temperature. A double-layered bag hangs in the tank’s center. Its inner sac flexes as the baby grows, from pomegranate-sized at 23 weeks to the heft of an eggplant by 28. The outer silicone layer is stiffer, with just enough give to resist the baby’s kicks and encourage its muscles to stretch and strengthen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tank, van der Ven tells me, is the simple part. The lungs are the true liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During a typical birth, a newborn’s first gulp of air triggers the breathing reflex, often announced with a wail that signals lungs at work. That moment comes too early for extremely premature infants: their runty lungs can’t sustain even a whisper, much less nourish the developing brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It’s like juggling 10 balls … only the balls are on fire and dropping one is not an option&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In today’s neonatal intensive care units, doctors can only step in after the fact, using ventilators and incubators to force these fragile organs to function. That mechanical intervention brings its own risks of lasting injury. And once exposed to air, the lungs are irreversibly activated; you can’t throw the fish back into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Artificial wombs aim to bypass this crisis altogether. In AquaWomb’s design, the baby is delivered via caesarean section into a fluid-filled pouch, where it can be transferred from mother to machine. Once inside the transfer chamber, clinicians reattach the umbilical cord to a human-made placenta, a fist-sized device lined with catheters delicate enough to pull carbon dioxide from the blood and cannulas robust enough to push oxygen and nutrients in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If it works, the placenta buys time that the baby’s lungs cannot yet provide. If it fails, the clock runs out in two minutes, the limit before oxygen deprivation risks permanent brain damage. The baby must remain immersed in fluid throughout this entire sequence, never realizing it is being born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s like juggling 10 balls,” says Frans van de Vosse, a professor in cardiovascular biomechanics at Eindhoven University of Technology who advises the project. “Only the balls are on fire and dropping one is not an option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If perfected, an artificial womb could rewrite the limits of viability. Perhaps this is why the handful of labs working on these machines hesitate even to name them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;AquaWomb describes its prototype as a “womb-like life support system”. (They are wary of the political and science-fiction associations attached to the term “artificial womb”.) And the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), considered the closest group to human clinical trials, called theirs a “biobag”. CHOP’s device made headlines in 2017, when researchers kept fetal lambs alive for 28 days, proving an artificial womb could sustain blood circulation and organ development in a living animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The entire field operates under a veil of secrecy. CHOP representatives declined to comment for this story. (Vitara Biomedical, the private company that licensed CHOP’s artificial womb technology, has raised more than &lt;a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/vitara-biomedical/__ejN3OB3idrqsVCnJzWsgiDuTm1rJy4Koe7RzsaOyEMk#about-the-company" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$125m&lt;/a&gt;, a sign they might be preparing for clinical trials.) Some researchers told me CHOP scientists have agreed to collaboration meetings, then backed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The guardedness reflects both the scrutiny surrounding reproductive technology and the knowledge that, as van der Ven puts it, “in science, there’s evolutionary and there’s revolutionary”. An artificial womb would be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her team is not trying to win the race at all costs. “We don’t need to be the first. We want to be the best,” she says. For her, that means designing a system where parents can interact with their gestating babies, a priority she feels other researchers have overlooked. One AquaWomb prototype includes access ports that let parents touch their infants. Another features a “uterus phone”, which pipes voices, music or heartbeats into the fluid at the same muffled pitch a fetus would hear in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those parent-child interactions – pressing a fingertip against a foot, speaking into the fluid, feeling a shift inside the bag – could improve &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6606523/#s4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;long-term&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02449-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28212591/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;outcomes&lt;/a&gt; for premature infants. But the stakes of parental bonding during pregnancy go beyond survival statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research on families’ experiences with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001502829900583X" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in-vitro fertilization and surrogacy&lt;/a&gt; suggests that when pregnancy departs from the normal course, parents – especially mothers – may struggle to feel like proper caregivers. Extremely premature births can invoke &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10507618/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9297088/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;feelings&lt;/a&gt;, in part because prematurity is usually caused by medical complications with the mother rather than the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They may not feel they’ve fulfilled their ‘duty’ to protect and carry their child,” says Romanis. She &lt;a href="https://jme.bmj.com/content/50/5/299" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argues that any ethical alternative&lt;/a&gt; to “natural” pregnancy must address parents’ emotional needs alongside infants’ physiological ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, seeing your baby suspended in a tank or sealed in a bag could alter not only how you connect with them, but how you see yourself as a parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;hree months after losing her son, Beth joined a biweekly support group for parents who have experienced late-term pregnancy loss or whose newborns died soon after birth, often because of extreme prematurity. Attenders discuss what to do with unopened baby gifts or how to deflect well-meaning questions from relatives and co-workers. Many are parents of children who might have been prime candidates for an artificial womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Beth invites me to join her, I picture a lecture hall or hospital conference room. Instead, we arrive at the basement of a Boston church, where Wendy, a therapist who leads the group, arranges a circle of folding chairs. Attenders trickle in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a2c7da51-44cc-48d2-8a24-7d2b36120946" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Juliette van Haren with research components for a transfer device and artificial womb for premature babies.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van Overbeeke&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Only one of today’s 17 attenders is a man. (He and his husband lost their daughter when their surrogate miscarried late in pregnancy.) Across from me sits a girl who looks too young to order a drink at the bar, let alone to have already had and buried a baby. Her peroxide blond hair brushes the salt-and-pepper nest of Joanne, who is nearly 60 and has been attending for three years, having joined the group over a decade after losing her son. The group also includes an English professor, stay-at-home mom, police officer and pediatric nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In this circle, I see how pregnancy loss is unequally borne, but grief is indiscriminate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one knows how long the group has existed. Membership is word-of-mouth. “We tried making a Facebook group once,” Beth tells me, “But it got overtaken by anti-vaxxers asking if we’d had the Covid vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“And then my account got suspended because I told them to fuck off,” Joanne snorts. “When I lost my baby, I also lost my patience for dealing with grown-ass babies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wendy lays a hand on Joanne’s wrist and winks at me. “As you can see, we’re very open here. You can ask us about your baby bags.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Biobags”, I utter through hiccupy laughs, unprepared for their nonchalance. I explain that the technology is still several years from hospitals, and even then, would probably be offered only to infants born at 22 or 23 weeks, who have paltry alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I lost my baby at 22 weeks,” Joanne interrupts. “Are you saying this could have saved him?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Maybe,” I admit. “But not necessarily. Hypothetically, if your doctors thought he was a candidate for an artificial womb, would you have …”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Absolutely,” Joanne insists. “All I wanted was to save him. If my body couldn’t do that, then maybe this womb thing could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The parents crave more morsels of information to feed their hypotheticals: &lt;em&gt;Could my baby have survived at 21 weeks? How much would it cost? Would I be able to see my daughter? Hold her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two women grimace when I describe the prototypes, but the others lean forward and ask for photographs. They picture their children in an artificial womb, submerged in the soothing embrace of synthetic dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These parents do not know exactly what the technology could have given them, but it is agonizingly clear that they understand what they have lost without it. Most have not disassembled their babies’ cribs. The pediatric nurse contemplates switching specialties because she cannot be around newborns without wanting to cry. And Beth often clutches her belly as she speaks, like she is cradling a child who is no longer there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Maybe there is a future world where every parent can access this technology … How will they know whether it’s the right decision&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Each parent is haunted by what could have been done differently. Most cling to the idea that more intervention, more technology, might have saved their babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wendy hesitates. “Is more always better?” She recounts delivering her daughter via C-section at 24 weeks and begging her doctors to administer aggressive care. Despite the precarious birth, the doctors saved Wendy’s baby in the operating room, compressing her chest to churn blood to her brain. For four months in the Nicu (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit), her daughter lived tethered to lines and flushed with drugs. These were costly, painful procedures. But her stunted lungs needed more time to mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wendy needed more time, too. “The prognosis was bad, but when it comes to your kid, you can’t help but keep praying for a miracle. I couldn’t let her go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After 131 days, her daughter died from a collapsed lung. For months, Wendy was racked with guilt, hot and salty grief leaking down her face. “I felt so selfish,” she says. “Even though I eventually let go of those feelings, I wish I’d given her a more peaceful, less prolonged end.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although she supports the development of artificial wombs, Wendy wonders how doctors will obtain informed consent from parents who are desperate to save their babies. “Maybe there is a future world where every parent can access this technology,” she says. “How will they know whether it’s the right decision? For the baby, or for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I can’t stop looking at the photos of the lambs in the baggies,” Beth tells me, a week after my first visit to her support group. “Probably should stop doing it right before lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/25/artificial-womb-for-premature-babies-successful-in-animal-trials-biobag" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;footage of CHOP’s animal trials&lt;/a&gt; unsettled her, not only the sight of slick pink bodies drifting in fluid, but also its eerie resemblance to a scene from The Matrix, where human infants are farmed in industrial pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, scientists and science-fiction writers alike have been chasing the stork. In 1958, a Swedish team tried to sustain &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13570957" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven “pre-viable” human fetuses&lt;/a&gt; in what was essentially a pressure-cooker incubator with a pump to oxygenate blood. Their test lasted only a few hours, and modern ethics boards would recoil at the crude attempt to create an artificial womb. Still, what had once been a thought experiment briefly took on flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Today’s artificial womb prototypes are neither capable of nor designed to supplant natural pregnancy. Nonetheless, when CHOP published its research on biobags, it birthed a stream of sensational speculations around “complete ectogenesis”, where fertilization to birth occurs entirely outside a woman’s uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers have tried to tamp down those associations, positioning their work as a giant leap forward for science but an unremarkable tiptoe for parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="126db809-478c-4caf-9627-ca031f1ec971" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The Perinatal Life Support system from startup AquaWomb focuses on a safe transition from the mother to the baby’s water incubator. Here, a specially developed, realistic and advanced baby doll demonstrates how this could happen.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: TU/e [Eindhoven University of Technology/Bart van Overbeeke&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The concept of complete ectogenesis is so far away that it’s not worth talking about in relation to the current work,” says one scientist working on artificial wombs. (He speaks to me on the condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting his public relations representative.) “Premature babies die every day, and this technology could save at least some of them. If you want to sit around debating The Matrix, you’re missing the point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other experts believe these concerns can’t be brushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is no such thing as ‘not worth talking about’ when it comes to procreative futures. Science fiction and science fact aren’t so far divorced when it comes to thinking about what might be a problem,” Romanis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She adds that, even in its earliest form, an artificial womb would confront parents with agonizing choices. This makes me think about Wendy, who wondered how a parent, driven by the desperate hope of saving their child, could understand the implications of placing their baby in a highly experimental device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On this point, such clinicians such as Christoph Haller, a cardiovascular surgeon in Toronto, describe artificial wombs as an opportunity for continuity rather than rupture. His team is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33650787/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;testing their own prototype on fetal pigs&lt;/a&gt;. “The conversations with parents won’t be entirely new,” he says. “We already have to ask them to make impossible decisions: do we intubate, do we operate, do we stop? With any new technology, we’ll keep being honest about what we know and what we don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But no one writes dystopian novels about IV drips or ventilators. With artificial wombs, the fantasy – and the fear – are built in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Would my husband and I even have used a surrogate if something like this had been available?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That becomes clear when I return to the grief group a month after my first visit. Beth again raises the lamb photos. Joanne nods quickly. “I keep looking at them too. If that bag had been around, maybe I wouldn’t be sitting here. I’d have signed anything to get another few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Across the circle, a younger woman shakes her head sharply. “That’s just it. You wouldn’t have had a choice. They’d cram your baby in whether you wanted them to or not.” She won’t say who &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are – politicians, doctors, hospitals – but the suspicion hangs heavy. “People already treat you like you’re selfish if you don’t do every single intervention. This would be one more thing they’d hold over you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man who lost his daughter during surrogacy clears his throat. “I can’t help wondering, would my husband and I even have used a surrogate if something like this had been available? Maybe the right thing would be to avoid putting another person at risk by asking them to carry a pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The room vibrates with competing anxieties: that the technology will not arrive soon enough, and that it might arrive too fast. Here, the debates over biology versus technology, care versus coercion, compress into a small circle of folding chairs. And no matter where one falls on these questions, it would be naive to ignore their gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;uring our final meeting, Beth wears denim overalls speckled with talcum-colored paint. Strips of tape adorn the trim of an otherwise empty room. Beth grips a soaked brush bigger than her face, and the nursery walls around us are still wet enough to smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is the last step,” she tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For months after her son died, Beth refused to enter the nursery she had built for him. Then, she joined the pregnancy grief group, where Wendy advised her to “take baby steps when packing up the room” (“No pun intended,” Beth says wearily).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On her first attempt, Beth’s knees buckled just five steps beyond the doorway. “The room felt like a memorial for someone who had barely been alive,” she says. She tried again a week later, this time taking two stuffed animals when she left. Two days later, she came again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Item by item, Beth took apart the nursery. She numbed herself to the objects she removed: crocheted baby bootees; a half-completed scrapbook with maternity photos of Beth and her now ex-husband, palms tenderly pressed against her pregnant belly. She hired someone else to disassemble the crib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We talk about artificial wombs while she runs her brush over the nursery walls. The mural on the far wall – a hand-painted landscape of a mountain range – is the last to disappear. “If this technology existed, would I be a bad mom if I didn’t use it?” she wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="49d60b74-a108-4039-a30c-831b3eb5c63c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":84,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Maha is backing this ‘natural’ infertility treatment.

But they may also reflect an indecision inherent to parenthood: the dread of making the wrong choice between what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;do for your child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If Beth’s son had been born 20 years later, he might have had a different brush with life. In one version of this alternate future, he grows in an artificial womb that saves his life. Beth fills her scrapbook with Polaroids of her baby, his toes snuggled into knitted bootees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In another version, Beth’s son is placed into an artificial womb: the doctors know he faces long odds and are willing to give him a fighting chance. Beth watches her baby grow in the tank and prays for a miracle. But the odds don’t tilt in his favor; the miracle does not materialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Would Beth feel better, believing she had done everything she could to save him? Or would she for ever wonder whether her choices prolonged her son’s life, and his possible pain, for the same outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These are the considerations that underlie the overarching debate of how we should use artificial wombs when they become available. And if research labs and FDA committees are where resolutions to these questions are codified, then the choices of parents like Beth are where they are brought to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There aren’t any easy answers here for me, or for any parent,” Beth says. For now, she just keeps painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9QclVQU3dvY1pUTWJoV2NpYXRXOVlpQmIxaURTYlprQVVlMHpsb284elY5Ykl5eVBLdFRRMUdSLWtYY3RLdmxScjRjaGU2Wl9CNE55WmlVbDVLZWxnY2paQ1V0dGQ3M1JGX0staHpydGdNc0tFT3RUSw</guid></item><item><title>为流感季节做好准备：接种TRICARE疫苗- TRICARE新闻室(.mil)</title><link>https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/4327945/prepare-for-flu-season-get-vaccinated-with-tricare</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

                FALLS CHURCH, Va.   –  
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            With children back in school and temperatures dropping, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is quickly approaching. Although most respiratory illnesses share common symptoms, the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is more serious than the common cold. It can lead to hospitalization and even death in severe cases. Flu season generally runs through fall and winter, and one of the best things you can do to protect your health is get a flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; for all people aged 6 months and older (with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html#:~:text=to%20be%20vaccinated).-,People%20who%20SHOULD%20NOT%20get%20a%20flu%20shot,-Children%20younger%20than" target="_blank"&gt;rare exceptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are multiple benefits to getting the flu vaccine,” said Jeannine Pickrell, MS, RN, Population Health, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Not only are you taking precautions to keep yourself healthy during the fall and winter months, but you’re also taking steps to protect the community, including family and loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learn how to get your TRICARE-covered flu vaccine today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;When is the best time to get vaccinated?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, September and October are the best months to get the flu vaccine. Getting it too early can limit the effectiveness of the vaccine. However, getting the vaccine later in the flu season still has benefits, since the virus will still be circulating. Flu season usually peaks in February and can continue into May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, there are some populations who are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; for having complications from the flu. It’s especially important for people in these groups to get the flu vaccine. This group includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;People aged 65 and older&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;People with certain chronic medical conditions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Children younger than 5 years old (and especially children under 2)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you’re a health care worker or live with populations who are at high risk for flu complications, it’s important to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;What version of the vaccine should I get?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are many different versions of the flu vaccine. Which one you should get depends on your age, health conditions, and preferences. Consult with your provider to determine which version of the vaccine is best for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where can I get vaccinated?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are three ways you can get these vaccines at no cost, as described in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/Publications/Handbooks/pharmacy"&gt;&lt;i&gt;TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go to a &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/GettingCare/FindDoctor/mtf" target="_blank"&gt;military hospital or clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go to a &lt;a href="https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy" target="_blank"&gt;TRICARE retail network pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider (like a doctor or nurse practitioner) gives you a vaccine at a participating pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;See a &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/GettingCare/FindDoctor" target="_blank"&gt;TRICARE-authorized provider&lt;/a&gt;. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;Before getting the vaccine, call to check if you need an appointment and if the vaccine is available. Remember to bring your Uniformed Services ID card.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recognizing flu symptoms &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most common flu symptoms include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Runny or stuffy nose&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tiredness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can have the flu before symptoms appear, so getting vaccinated can help prevent you from getting the most prominent strains of the influenza virus. Even if you do get sick, the symptoms may be less severe if you’ve received a flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other steps to prevent spreading the flu include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoiding close contact with people who are sick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Covering coughs and sneezes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washing your hands often&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do get sick, it’s important to stay home until you’ve been fever-free for 24 hours and your symptoms are improving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talk to your provider if you have questions about vaccines.

    &lt;p&gt;Grey hair is an inevitable hallmark of ageing. It’s a visual reminder of the passing years and all the bodily changes that accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But emerging scientific research is challenging this simple narrative – revealing that those silver strands on our heads could be an outward sign of our body’s own intricate defences against &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-14"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01769-9"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in mice has uncovered the remarkable ways in which our bodies manage cellular damage – a process key in both ageing and cancer. In ageing, cellular damage gradually weakens and disrupts cell function. In cancer, unrepaired or faulty cells can trigger abnormal growth and tumour formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work here has highlighted a surprising connection between the loss of pigment in our hair and the mechanisms that can keep deadly cancers at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1720"&gt;Melanocyte stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are at the heart of this discovery. These cells reside deep within the hair follicles and serve as a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1720"&gt;reservoir for melanocytes&lt;/a&gt; – the pigment-producing cells responsible for hair and skin colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, our melanocyte stem cells &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/mmt.15.4"&gt;replenish these pigment-producing&lt;/a&gt; cells through cyclical regeneration, a process characterised by repeated phases of activity, resting and renewal in sync with the natural cycles of hair growth and loss. This grants a steady supply of pigment and thus vibrant hair colour throughout most of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every day, our cells endure assaults on its own DNA (the genetic material inside our cells) from sources such as ultraviolet radiation, chemical exposure and even our own cellular metabolism process. This &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminhematol.2016.11.001"&gt;cellular damage&lt;/a&gt; contributes to both ageing and to the risk of cancers – such as melanoma, a type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new study sheds light on what happens when melanocyte stem cells deep within the supportive niche of the hair follicle sustain DNA damage – particularly a type of damage called double-strand breaks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this happens, the melanocyte stem cells can undergo a process called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41581-022-00601-z"&gt;“seno-differentiation”&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, this means that the stem cells irreversibly mature into pigment cells – then disappear from the stem cell pool, leading to the gradual appearance of grey in our hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;DNA damage can cause some of these stem cells to irreversibly mature and turn grey.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-gray-hair-unrecognizable-man-combing-2563295985"&gt;Beti Argi/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This protective process is tightly regulated by internal signalling pathways which allow the cells to communicate with each other. By removing these mature cells from the stem cell population, this prevents the accumulation and possible future spread of genetic mutations or DNA changes that could promote cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, each grey hair is a small victory of bodily self-sacrifice: a cell choosing to bow out rather than risk turning malignant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cancer link&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story doesn’t end there, however. Not all DNA damage triggers this protective process. In their experiments, the researchers exposed melanocyte stem cells in mice to potent cancer-causing chemicals as well as UV radiation. Remarkably, under these stressors, melanocyte stem cells were found to bypass seno-differentiation altogether. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, signals from the surrounding tissues actually encouraged the damaged cells to self-renew and continue dividing – despite carrying genetic damage. This created a cellular environment ripe for the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/mmt.15.4"&gt;emergence of melanoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research suggests that the fate of melanocyte stem cells appears to hinge on both the specific kind of damage they receive and on the molecular cues present in their micro-environment. Stressors such as chemicals or UV light, which cause the cells’ DNA strands to break, also cause the melanocyte stem cells to self-destruct by default. This same process causes grey hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when under the influence of cancer cells, these damaged melanocyte stem cells persist – creating seeds from which melanoma can grow. Scientists describe this dynamic as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01769-9"&gt;“antagonistic fates”&lt;/a&gt; – where the same stem cell population can take two dramatically different paths depending on the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these findings reframe grey hair and melanoma not as unrelated outcomes, but as twin fates of the body’s ancient struggle to balance tissue renewal and avoid cancer. Greying is not itself a shield against cancer, but instead a byproduct of a protective process that eliminates risky cells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when the control mechanisms falter or are subverted by carcinogens, the door is left open for malignancy. This new understanding may also help begin to explain why we’re more likely to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12943-024-02020-z"&gt;develop cancer as we get older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s crucial to note the limits of these findings. Much of the pivotal evidence comes from experiments in mice. This means research still needs to be conducted in humans to understand if our melanocyte stem cells also function in a similar way. Biological differences between species, as well as complexities of human lifestyles and genetics, mean the picture for our own hair and cancer risk is nuanced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, these discoveries open exciting avenues for both cancer research and ageing science. Understanding the signals that nudge stem cells toward differentiation or risky expansion could someday enable therapies to reinforce the body’s natural  safeguards, potentially lowering cancer risk as we age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are broader implications as well. This information could help explain why some people develop melanoma even without having been exposed to clear &lt;a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/melanoma/causes-and-risk-factors-of-melanoma"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; – and why &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-019-0721-1"&gt;cancers and tissue degeneration&lt;/a&gt; so often go &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.09.001"&gt;hand-in-hand&lt;/a&gt; in later life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of grey hair is not just about vanity or the inevitable march of time. It’s about evolution, adaptation and the ceaseless vigilance of our bodies’ internal guardians. Those silver strands may be telling us something profound: that amid the competition between ageing and cancer, sometimes it’s worth sacrificing a pigment cell for the sake of the whole organism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Needless to say, I was quite shocked at the results. I have always been an active individual and am not overweight. I have never had high cholesterol nor high blood pressure. I am, however, a diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N5B2CHFLRZDH3HL5IV6GMZN2EQ"&gt;I have an appointment with a cardiologist in the near future. I also understand that one cannot lower the score. Is there a possibility that these numbers could have been skewed or interpreted wrongly? Do you recommend a repeat test? Could you give some insight on this test? -- S.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YL3XSNDMO5AARBNSGQWQWTLAZY"&gt;ANSWER: A coronary calcium score uses a very fast CT scanner to take pictures of the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood. There really isn’t room for misinterpretation, and unless they scanned someone else they thought was you, there isn’t room for error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IVVVSH4QRJCBHH4MW2HRRMV74E"&gt;Many people who get a heart attack do not have traditional risk factors such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. Unfortunately, diabetes is a risk factor, but the better the control of the diabetes, the less likely a person will develop complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YFBV26ODUBEXRGOZA5HYQUHZ7E"&gt;A high calcium score is not a guarantee that you have or will get blockages in the heart arteries, but it does make blockages more likely. Using a decision analysis tool like the MESA calculator (MESA-NHLBI.org/researchers/tools/mesa-score-risk-calculator) can help you and your doctor decide whether a medication is worthwhile to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TVB6X2WOPJFKTFJ7ZYMKM6YJT4"&gt;I want to emphasize that medicines like statin drugs can still reduce the risk of a heart attack in people with normal cholesterol and blood pressure levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 56-year-old male in relatively good health. Over the past few years, I’ve developed difficulty sleeping. I’ve tried all the tips, but nothing really helped until I tried legally available THC drinks. I sleep great after consuming one of these beverages with zero side effects. My question is: Are these drinks safe for long-term use, or should I be limiting my intake? -- Anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="APJAQCBRLZBZVDA7GBN226THAY"&gt;ANSWER: I really can’t answer the long-term safety of THC when used for sleep. There just aren’t reliable long-term data for me to answer with any certainty. There are data for long-term heavy users of recreational cannabis, and in them, the rate of psychiatric diagnoses (psychosis and cognitive impairment) is increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ORRVHTYRWVAIHL74HZIFXIG2TE"&gt;Long-term heavy users can also get cannabis use disorder, where people use cannabis more than the intended dosage, and it adversely affects various aspects of their life. Cannabis use disorder is similar in some ways to opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. I think that both serious psychiatric illness and cannabis use disorder are unlikely when taking a single dose at bedtime, especially one with a relatively small dose of THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CKAPK5O2XVDNTK6X432VN3BGRA"&gt;Since you haven’t had side effects yet, it seems unlikely that you will develop them, but it depends on the dose. Some THC drinks contain 2-5 mg of THC, while others contain much more, as high as 100-200 mg. I would advise using the lowest dose that helps you sleep. I would also consider using THC every other day if you are concerned about dependence on THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PB45QJ4RENGMLPUKZOXTKRW7AE"&gt;Some cannabis products contain both THC and CBD. CBD has been found to lower anxiety. If what you are using now has CBD, consider changing to CBD only or a lower dose of THC to find the lowest effective dose. Be sure you know what you are getting; a third-party analysis is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KRLIELCB55CJLDBE3B6CHQXBNM"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

						&lt;p&gt;Quick routines don’t just fit busy mornings, they wake up your metabolism, prime your muscles, and flatten stubborn midsections faster than most long workouts. Your body runs on momentum, and the right sequence of movements early in the day lights up your core and supports deeper fat loss all day. You don’t need a treadmill, a gym, or a long window of time. You need targeted activation, steady intensity, and moves built to&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/10-minute-morning-routine-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt; unlock real results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This routine works because it stacks &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-stubborn-belly-fat-over-45/" target="_blank"&gt;calorie-burning strength&lt;/a&gt; and mobility in a short, metabolic burst. Every exercise in the 7-minute cycle hits your belly from a different angle, while matching the same total intensity you’d hit slogging on a treadmill. Each minute recreates the same muscle demands of a proper core workout, no floor crunching required. With effort and consistency, this morning flow helps replace belly fluff with the strength you feel during the rest of your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven minutes might sound almost too simple, but it changes how your body functions as soon as you roll out of bed. &lt;span&gt;A&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-routine-boosts-metabolism/" target="_blank"&gt; faster metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, firmer midsection, and more powerful start to the day in less time than it takes to make coffee.&lt;/span&gt; Here’s how to structure it for results you’ll see in your waistline within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;7-Minute Morning Belly Burn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;0:00–1:00 – Standing Knee Drives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRKJHy-89PU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive one knee toward your chest while pulling your elbows down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch legs rhythmically, like a powerful march.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your torso tall to activate deep core muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick up the pace and maintain strong, steady breaths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:00–2:00 – Cross-Body Reaches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZWUNO_xGnQ?si=KyWJPLTNm9WjhU__" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweep one arm across your body toward the opposite knee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pivot slightly through your hips to build rotational strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay light on your feet to raise your heart rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:00–3:00 – Fast Step Backs with Reach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKt33Ca9P3A?si=6fiM4hEVkKZXoL8R" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step one foot behind you while reaching the opposite arm forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to start and alternate sides continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your core tight and your movement powerful, not sloppy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move quickly while staying controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;3:00–4:00 – Side-To-Side Squat Reaches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KQKCbs7eZI?si=NduV4C4fIfb8q-B6" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squat low, shift left, and reach right hand across your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch sides without pausing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep chest lifted and glutes tight throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel your obliques and lower abs power the shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:00–5:00 – Standing Crunch to Press&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir4IuxaNceI?si=EdtVv1Of62o87-T0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring knee and both hands together at chest level like a standing crunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend arms overhead as you step back to reset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate sides and maintain tension during transitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the full motion to fire your entire core.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional cardio drains energy with repetitive motion that rarely targets your belly in a meaningful way. This standing flow tackles stubborn fat with total-body tension, rotation, and rapid transitions that torch calories while carving midsection definition. The constant standing engagement means your abs never switch off, unlike seated or floor exercises. In just seven minutes, you get a full metabolic spike, digestive boost, and ongoing calorie burn that outlasts most machine-based sessions.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03955-6" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, indicates that this benefit appears to stem not from reducing the initial protein plaques linked to the disease, but from slowing the accumulation of a second protein, tau, which is more directly tied to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the buildup of two main proteins in the brain. The first, amyloid-beta, forms clumps called plaques that can appear decades before any symptoms emerge. The second protein, tau, later forms tangles inside brain cells, a development that tracks closely with the onset of memory and thinking problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While physical inactivity is a known modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s, the specific ways it affects this biological progression in humans have remained somewhat unclear. Many previous studies relied on self-reported exercise, which can be prone to inaccuracies, especially in people who may be experiencing early cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a more precise picture, a team of researchers at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School utilized data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. This long-term project follows older adults to better understand brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease. The researchers sought to use objective measurements to connect physical activity with the specific brain changes and cognitive symptoms seen in the disease’s preclinical stage, the long period when brain changes are underway but before dementia is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation involved 296 participants between the ages of 50 and 90, all of whom were cognitively healthy at the study’s outset. To measure their physical activity, each participant wore a waistband-mounted pedometer for seven consecutive days to calculate an average daily step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used positron emission tomography, or PET scans, to measure the amount of amyloid-beta plaques in each person’s brain at the beginning of the study. Over a follow-up period that lasted up to 14 years, with an average of over nine years, participants received annual cognitive assessments to track any changes in their thinking and memory skills. A smaller group of 172 participants also received repeated PET scans to monitor the accumulation of tau tangles over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a clear pattern among individuals who had elevated levels of amyloid-beta in their brains at the start. In this at-risk group, those who took more steps per day experienced significantly slower declines on cognitive tests. They also showed slower declines in their ability to perform daily functions. This relationship between physical activity and better cognitive outcomes was not observed in people who had low levels of amyloid at baseline, largely because that group experienced very little cognitive decline over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the mechanism behind this protective association, the researchers first checked whether physical activity was linked to the amount of amyloid itself. They found no connection. People who were more active did not have less amyloid at the beginning of the study, nor did they accumulate it more slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference appeared to be related to tau. In participants with high amyloid levels, taking more steps per day was associated with a slower buildup of tau tangles in the inferior temporal cortex, a brain region affected early in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This sheds light on why some people who appear to be on an Alzheimer’s disease trajectory don’t decline as quickly as others,” said senior author Jasmeer Chhatwal of the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. “Lifestyle factors appear to impact the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that lifestyle changes may slow the emergence of cognitive symptoms if we act early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further statistical modeling suggested that this effect on tau was the primary reason for the cognitive benefits. The analysis indicated that the slower accumulation of tau fully accounted for the relationship between physical activity and slower cognitive decline. It also partially explained the link between activity and slower functional decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled that data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study has helped the field better understand the importance of physical activity for maintaining brain health,” said co-author Reisa Sperling, a neurologist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology and co-principal investigator of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. “These findings show us that it’s possible to build cognitive resilience and resistance to tau pathology in the setting of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also examined how much activity was needed to see a benefit. The researchers categorized participants into four groups based on their daily step counts: inactive (3,000 steps or fewer), low activity (3,001 to 5,000 steps), moderate activity (5,001 to 7,500 steps), and active (more than 7,501 steps). They found that even moving from the inactive group to the low-activity group was associated with substantially slower tau buildup and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits continued to increase into the moderate-activity range but then appeared to level off, suggesting that the largest gains were seen when sedentary individuals became more active. This may offer a more approachable goal than the popular 10,000-steps-a-day target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to empower people to protect their brain and cognitive health by keeping physically active,” said first-author Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, a cognitive neurologist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. “Every step counts — and even small increases in daily activities can build over time to create sustained changes in habit and health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an observational study, this research identifies strong associations but cannot definitively prove cause and effect. It is possible that individuals with the very earliest, subtle brain changes of preclinical Alzheimer’s were already becoming less physically active, a concept known as reverse causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted several sensitivity analyses to account for this possibility, and their results remained consistent. The study population was also primarily composed of highly educated, non-Hispanic white individuals, which means the findings might not be generalizable to all populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the research team plans to explore which aspects of physical activity, such as intensity or consistency, might be most important for brain health. They also intend to investigate the biological mechanisms that could connect physical activity to reduced tau accumulation. The results of this study could help in designing future clinical trials that test exercise interventions, especially by suggesting that enrolling sedentary individuals who have elevated brain amyloid may be the best way to detect a protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03955-6" target="_blank"&gt;Physical activity as a modifiable risk factor in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, Dylan R.

The blood test results popped up in my online health portal without much fanfare. A doctor would chat about them with me later, congratulating me on the "phew"-worthy result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I took the Galleri mult-cancer early detection (MCED) test about a year ago in 2024 as part of my longevity-focused stay at &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/went-bougie-medical-resort-shocking-115009427.html" data-ylk="slk:Canyon Ranch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Canyon Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/people-spend-20-000-resort-114006254.html" data-ylk="slk:luxury wellness retreat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;luxury wellness retreat&lt;/a&gt; in Tucson, Arizona. Galleri – which &lt;a href="https://www.galleri.com/patient/faqs#tab-448492-448507" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:costs $949;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;costs $949&lt;/a&gt;, and is not currently FDA-approved – is a blood test that studies DNA fragments shed into the bloodstream. Patients need a prescription before pulling up their sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;GRAIL, the company behind Galleri, recently &lt;a href="https://grail.com/press-releases/grail-pathfinder-2-results-show-galleri-multi-cancer-early-detection-blood-test-increased-cancer-detection-more-than-seven-fold-when-added-to-uspstf-a-and-b-recommended-screenings/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:presented findings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;presented findings&lt;/a&gt; from a study across 25,000 healthy adults over the age of 50. The test, the company says, found cancers at earlier stages and in organs that don't have routine screening. Galleri discovered cancer signals in 216 people, and 133 of them indeed had cancer. It also correctly predicted the cancer's origin 92% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We're able to isolate those DNA fragments, sequence them and look for those tumor-specific markers from the blood," says &lt;a href="https://grail.com/stories/member/megan-hall/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Megan Hall;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Megan Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the vice president of medical and corporate affairs at GRAIL. If a "cancer signal" is detected, it also provides a cancer signal origin prediction, or a clue to the providers and the patient which organ that signal could be coming from. If that origin was the pancreas, for example, doctors would know where to start looking for the possible cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The key plain takeaway: (This type of testing) &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; complement current screening by identifying lethal cancers that are otherwise undetected earlier and with limited downstream burden," says &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=46749" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mohamed Abazeed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mohamed Abazeed&lt;/a&gt;, chair and professor of radiation oncology at Northwestern University, who was not involved with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The big question: Is this the future of cancer treatment? A simple blood test? It's not that easy. The new research from the company, while promising, isn't going to get you out of your recommended colonoscopies and mammograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;'Just waiting to find' these hidden cancers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Multiple companies are trying to detect cancer via blood test. But GRAIL is the one you're hearing about in the mainstream thanks to its funding of large, international prospective clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It was clear to me, as we were running the study, that we were picking up some novel cancers at an early stage that we previously had no means of detecting," says &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/nima-nabavizadeh-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Nima Nabavizadeh;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Nima Nabavizadeh&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Oregon Health and Science University and author of GRAIL's Pathfinder 2 study presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We only widely screen for five cancers in the United States: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/25-old-survived-breast-cancer-120101005.html" data-ylk="slk:breast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/cancer/colon-cancer/articles/colon-cancer-rising-people-under-090528300.html" data-ylk="slk:colorectal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;colorectal&lt;/a&gt;, prostate, cervical and lung cancer, the latter in only high-risk patients. But 70% of cancer deaths come from those without a recommended screening test. That's where Galleri hopes to split the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the Galleri blood test the future of cancer treatment? It's not that simple. The new research from the company, while promising, isn't some cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These are largely cancers that we're normally, outside of these blood tests, just waiting to find them, either incidentally or because somebody has symptoms associated with them," Nabavizadeh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The test doesn't pick up some cancers as well, like prostate cancer, though there's already an effective diagnostic tool for that known as the PSA test. Why does Galleri detect certain cancers better than others?

But according to Abazeed, the FDA will want to see evidence that earlier detection means fewer late-stage cancers or a reduced risk of death. And that still isn't available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If the data bears out, it's a game-changer.

&lt;p&gt;Faced with a short commute and no car, many opt for a &lt;strong&gt;bicycle &lt;/strong&gt;over &lt;strong&gt;walking&lt;/strong&gt;—and for good reason. Cycling isn’t just faster. Biomechanically, it’s dramatically more efficient. According to &lt;em&gt;Professor Anthony Blazevich&lt;/em&gt;, a specialist in human movement at &lt;em&gt;Edith Cowan University&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;cycling is at least four times more energy-efficient than walking&lt;/strong&gt;, and significantly less physically demanding than running.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about speed. Research has consistently shown that the human body, when paired with a bicycle, becomes one of the most &lt;strong&gt;energy-efficient movers in the animal kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;. A now-famous comparison published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-human-on-a-bicycle-is-among-the-most-efficient-forms-of-travel-in-the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that &lt;strong&gt;a human on a bicycle uses less energy per kilometer than a flying bird or swimming fish&lt;/strong&gt;—a striking insight into the power of simple machines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes cycling so efficient? The answer lies in a combination of physics, engineering, and human physiology. Unlike walking, which relies on impact-heavy, energy-draining motion, cycling turns muscle power into forward motion with minimal waste.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Compact Motion, Major Energy Savings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;walking&lt;/strong&gt;, each step involves swinging the full weight of the leg forward, lifting it against gravity, and absorbing impact when the foot strikes the ground. That &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/surprising-study-walk-breaks-can-help-you-burn-more-energy/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="13450" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, repeated thousands of times per hour, adds up quickly. As Blazevich writes in his article reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/exercise-cycling-walking-health-benefit-b2857719.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, “Our legs must swing through large arcs… this swinging motion alone consumes a lot of energy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cycling removes much of that burden. The circular pedal stroke limits unnecessary motion and avoids vertical displacement. There’s &lt;strong&gt;no bouncing,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;no heel strike&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;no energy lost&lt;/strong&gt; through the ground. Instead, the rolling contact between tire and surface ensures &lt;strong&gt;continuous, low-resistance movement&lt;/strong&gt;—a core reason why the body requires less effort to maintain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed 1973 analysis published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-efficiency-of-the-bicycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; quantified this difference: &lt;strong&gt;humans on bicycles expend just 0.15 kilocalories per kilogram per kilometer&lt;/strong&gt;, compared to roughly &lt;strong&gt;0.3–0.5 kcal/kg/km when walking&lt;/strong&gt;. In practical terms, that means a person burns less than half the energy to travel the same distance by bike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gears, Gradients, and Muscle Limits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key reason cycling outperforms walking lies in how it matches the body’s muscular limitations. Muscles become less efficient as they contract more rapidly—a phenomenon known as the &lt;strong&gt;force-velocity relationship&lt;/strong&gt;. The faster the contraction, the more energy is required to produce the same force.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bicycles solve this elegantly. Through adjustable gearing, riders can maintain consistent muscle output even as terrain or speed changes. As Blazevich explains, “Gears let your muscles stay in their sweet spot for both force production and energy cost.” This is something no unaided form of locomotion can replicate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2011.00052/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Physiology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;supports this claim, showing that proper cadence and gear selection allows cyclists to &lt;strong&gt;optimize power output and delay fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, especially during long or repetitive efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, there are limits. On &lt;strong&gt;steep inclines over 15%&lt;/strong&gt;, the circular pedaling motion struggles to generate the vertical force needed. In these scenarios, walking—where the body can push directly upward—is often more efficient. Conversely, &lt;strong&gt;cycling downhill&lt;/strong&gt; becomes easier with increasing slope, while &lt;strong&gt;walking downhill&lt;/strong&gt; introduces joint stress and higher energy costs due to braking and shock absorption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not Just Transport—Physiological Partnership&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond transport, cycling is a model for how machines can extend human physical potential. Studies published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-022-01658-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; show that cycling produces &lt;strong&gt;lower joint loads, reduced impact forces&lt;/strong&gt;, and longer time-to-fatigue compared to walking or jogging at similar metabolic intensities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This makes it a particularly compelling form of movement for &lt;strong&gt;older adults&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;rehabilitation patients&lt;/strong&gt;, or anyone seeking sustained physical activity without overuse injuries. As cities seek ways to promote healthy aging and active transportation, the case for cycling as an inclusive, low-barrier solution continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your bicycle isn’t just a tool,” Blazevich notes. “It’s a machine evolved to partner with your physiology, maximizing energy use while minimizing physical strain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhl39j3b000d3b79fxxwgg66@published"&gt;My mother-in-law has a Chihuahua, “Chari,” who accompanies her everywhere. She assured us that Chari would be staying with a dog sitter. Well, surprise! My MIL showed up with the dog in tow, claiming he “wouldn’t be able to stand being apart from his Mommy.” I ended up having to stay at my sister’s, and a cleaning service had to be hired to purge the house after my MIL and Chari left.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjl22zk000p3b79f52tyy01@published"&gt;I am furious with my husband for siding with his mother over me. She lives three hours away, not three states, and it wouldn’t have been the end of the world for him to have insisted she go home due to my allergies. He thinks I made too big a deal over the situation, and even that maybe some exposure to the dog might have helped me develop some “immunity!” How can I get it into his head that he needs to support me in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="239" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjl235d000s3b79jru5xfku@published"&gt;I really wish I could get a glass of wine with you and hear about a million more details about your relationship with your mother-in-law, husband, and even this poor, anxious dog. But in the absence of knowing how you feel about these mammals, I’ve developed a conspiracy theory: Is it possible your MIL brought Chari on purpose, knowing you’d have to leave, because she was craving some solo time with her son? That’s exactly the kind of stunt I could see some of today’s overzealous #BoyMom parenting influencers pulling in 20 years when their beloved little princes grow up and get married. If there’s part of you that thinks bringing Chari was a bit of light bioterrorism in service of mother-son time, I’d gently float the idea that your husband makes a solo visit out to his mom soon, or plans another trip with just her. Even if the next visit is still a trip to your house, ask him to make sure to carve out a special activity or meal for just the two of them and inform his mom ahead of time about the plan. He should make the special activity something she’ll definitely want to do, and it shouldn’t allow dogs. It doesn’t sound like your MIL is willing to make accommodations for you, but maybe she’ll make them to visit a museum or attend a play with her son, and you’ll reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjl2377000t3b79on2aibkz@published"&gt;Another possibility: Despite what I’m sure were clear explanations about your pet allergy, maybe your MIL didn’t quite comprehend that you would actually have to leave your house to accommodate her. There’s a small part of me that thinks now that she knows she inconvenienced you so deeply, she’d be too embarrassed to ever repeat this behavior. But my guess is she would have checked herself into a pet-friendly hotel or Airbnb immediately if that were the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhl68n3500153b793pocml8o@published"&gt;So you’re right: The bigger issue here is that you need to compromise with your husband. Before the next visit, you two need to get on the same page about what you mean when you say he needs to support you. When you found out she was bringing the dog, was your first suggestion that she turn around and go home? I could see why she and your husband might bristle at that. I’m not sure it’s fair to insist that supporting you meant making her turn right around and go home. But making you leave wasn’t a fair solution either. It sounds like what you might need from him is an apology and an affirmation that he believes you when you say your allergies are real and challenging (sure, &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-allergy-immunotherapy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy for allergies exists, but it’s not at all a simple process&lt;/a&gt;). And he might need &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;to affirm that you do want to spend time with his mom as long as her visit doesn’t put you at medical risk.&lt;/p&gt;

A pet-friendly accommodation is a glaring third option that doesn’t involve anyone being chased from their house or canceling what I’d imagine was a much-anticipated trip. If there aren’t any near you, a friend, neighbor, or even local vet will know of a dog sitter who will be willing to watch Chari in the future. I wish all four of you many years of stress- and sneeze-free visits ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

It regulates blood pressure, metabolism, and overall cardiovascular function. Yet, in modern life, many people go to bed later because of long work hours or time spent on digital devices. Scientists are now learning that when we sleep may be just as important as how much we sleep. While poor or short sleep has long been known to raise the risk of heart problems, recent research has begun to explore whether bedtime itself plays a role. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.709468/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;new study published in Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that people who regularly go to bed after midnight on weekdays have a higher risk of heart attack. This discovery suggests that the timing of sleep could directly affect heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How our body clock keeps the heart in rhythm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human body follows a 24-hour internal clock known as the circadian rhythm. This clock helps control when we feel awake or sleepy and regulates vital functions such as blood pressure, hormone levels, and heart rate. The heart and blood vessels work in line with this natural rhythm, staying more active during the day and resting at night. When people stay up well past midnight, they interfere with this built-in schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over time, this disruption can place extra strain on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally! Sadhguru’s 5-Step Routine for Deep Rest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Frontiers study, researchers found that people who regularly went to bed late on weekdays were more likely to experience a heart attack. Interestingly, this pattern did not appear on weekends, suggesting that weekday routines, combined with early wake-up times, may increase the heart’s workload. These results show that bedtime can influence heart health independently of sleep duration, highlighting the importance of aligning sleep with the body’s natural rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research revealed about bedtime and heart risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined information from 4,576 adults who took part in the Sleep Heart Health Study, which tracks sleep patterns and cardiovascular outcomes. Participants reported their usual bedtime and wake-up time for both weekdays and weekends. Their bedtimes were grouped into four ranges: before 10:00 pm, between 10:01 pm and 11:00 pm, between 11:01 pm and midnight, and after midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers followed them for more than ten years to see who developed myocardial infarction, the medical term for heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear pattern. Those who went to bed after midnight during weekdays were much more likely to have a heart attack than those who slept between 10:01 pm and 11:00 pm. Even after accounting for other risk factors such as smoking, body weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, alcohol use, and total sleep duration, the link remained strong. People with late weekday bedtimes had about a 63 per cent higher risk of heart attack. Interestingly, going to bed very early, before 10:00 pm, also carried a slightly higher risk, forming a U-shaped pattern where both extremes of bedtime appeared less favourable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why late nights can harm the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why staying up late might increase heart risk. First, delaying sleep disrupts the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps control blood pressure and supports repair of blood vessels during the night. Low melatonin levels can lead to higher blood pressure and more inflammation in the arteries. Late nights are also often linked to shorter and poorer-quality sleep, reducing the amount of deep rest the body needs to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who stay up late may also adopt habits that harm the heart, such as eating late, being less physically active, and spending long hours exposed to bright screens. These behaviours can increase blood sugar and cholesterol levels, encourage weight gain, and heighten stress hormone activity. Over time, such changes can damage blood vessels and make heart attacks more likely. Laboratory studies have shown that irregular sleep timing raises cortisol, impairs glucose control, and increases blood clotting which are all factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How regular sleep habits can protect the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a consistent bedtime may help protect against heart problems. Going to bed around the same time each night supports the body’s internal clock and allows the cardiovascular system to rest and repair properly. Health researchers are beginning to recognise that sleep timing should be considered alongside diet, exercise, and smoking in assessing heart-disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late-night lifestyles have become common in modern society, with technology, shift work, and flexible schedules often pushing people to stay awake longer. This pattern can create “social jet lag”, where a person’s biological clock is constantly out of sync with daily routines. Over time, this misalignment may increase blood pressure, disturb metabolism, and raise the risk of obesity and diabetes, all key contributors to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health experts suggest that improving sleep habits could be a simple but effective way to support heart health. Going to bed at a steady, reasonable hour and getting enough rest may help maintain healthy blood pressure, balance stress hormones, and lower inflammation. Although more research is needed to prove that changing bedtime directly reduces heart-attack risk, the current evidence makes one thing clear: the time we go to sleep could be just as important for heart health as how long we stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

For the knock-in of mNG2_11, 200-nt homology-directed recombination templates were ordered in single-stranded DNA form as ultramer oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies). C42B cells were treated with 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; nocodazole (Sigma) for 14 h before electroporation. Cas9–sgRNA RNP complexes were assembled with 100 pmol Cas9 protein and 130 pmol sgRNA before electroporation and combined with 375 pmol homology-directed recombination template and 1 µg pCE-mp53DD (Addgene, cat. no. 41856) in a final volume of 25 µl. Electroporation was carried out following the protocol of SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza, cat. no. V4XC-2024). Nocodazole-treated cells (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) were collected and resuspended to 75 µl SF solution. RNP/template/pCE-mp53DD mix (25 μl) was then added to cell suspension. Cells were electroporated immediately with 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza) program EN-120 and transferred to a six-well plate with prewarmed medium. Electroporated cells were recovered for 5 days before infection with lentivirus expressing mNG2_1-10 (Addgene, cat. no. 82610). At 72 h after infection, mNG2 fluorescence positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry into single clones. Genomic DNA from AR reporter single clones were extracted for sanger sequencing (MCLab) as well as exome sequencing (QB3 UC Berkeley) to verify the mNG2-11 insertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec13"&gt;CRISPRi flow cytometry screen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genome-scale CRISPRi screens were performed following the Weissman laboratory protocol (&lt;a href="http://weissman.wi.mit.edu/"&gt;weissmanlab.ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;) as we reported previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Chesner, L.

All patients gave informed consent in writing for collection of their materials to the UCLH Cancer Biobank (Research Ethics Committee approval 15/YH/0311). All investigators were blinded to patient data related to outcome, and all clinicopathological information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our FFPE–PS samples originated from 11 stage III microsatellite-stable cancers with lymph node metastases from the same cohort, 9 of which are shared with FF–WGS samples. FFPE sections were cut in the following order: H&amp;amp;E-1 (5 μm), 5 × 8 μm for laser capture microdissection, H&amp;amp;E-2 (5 μm), 8 × 5 μm for CyCIF, H&amp;amp;E-3 (5 μm). The H&amp;amp;E slides from each FFPE block were digitized using the NanoZoomer S210 or S60 (Hamamatsu). Images were reviewed using NDPViewer software (v.2.9.29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regions of interest (ROIs) were identified as single glands or clusters of small adjacent glands (microbiopsies) from superficial, invasive margin or lymph node deposits. Superficial regions were defined as cancer regions adjacent to or contiguous with normal mucosa. The tumor–normal interface was identified where possible, and the invasive margin was defined as the region within 500 μm either side of the tumor–normal interface (with an overall extent of ~1 mm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec13"&gt;Panel sequencing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROIs were microdissected using PALM MicroBeam Laser Microdissection (Zeiss). DNA was extracted using the High Pure FFPET DNA Isolation Kit (Roche). Extracted FFPE DNA was repaired using the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix. Postrepair, whole-genome libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with unique molecular identifier (UMI) adapters ligated onto DNA molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS on FFPE samples was carried out using a custom targeted panel designed by L. Zapata and manufactured by Twist BioSciences, focusing on regions encoding the immunopeptidome and antigen-presenting related genes. The immunopeptidome was defined as the set of the human nine-mers that bind strongly to one of the top 70 &lt;i&gt;HLA&lt;/i&gt; alleles, was confirmed T cell positive in IEDB and were derived from a gene with mean expression of more than one fragments per kilobase million pancancer. The final list of these immunopeptidome loci can be obtained from: &lt;a href="https://github.com/luisgls/SOPRANO/blob/master/immunopeptidomes/human/allhlaBinders_exprmean1.IEDBpeps.unique.bed"&gt;https://github.com/luisgls/SOPRANO/blob/master/immunopeptidomes/human/allhlaBinders_exprmean1.IEDBpeps.unique.bed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twist Target Enrichment Protocol was used to hybridize probes from the this custom panel with prepared libraries. Hybridized targets were isolated and amplified with PCR. Paired-end 50-bp runs were performed on Novaseq S1 (Illumina).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14"&gt;Processing of sequencing data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The processing of FF–WGS data was detailed in ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Heide, T. et al.

Fastq files were then created from this unmapped bam (SamToFastq, Picard v.2.20.3) and aligned to human reference genome build GRCh38/hg38 with Burrows–Wheeler Aligner package BWA-MEM v.0.7.17. Alignment data from the outputted bam from this step were merged with data in the previously generated unmapped bam (using the MergeBamAlignment function of Picard v.2.20.3). The merged bam file was then used as input for GroupReadsByUMI (Fgbio v.1.3.0). ‘Adjacency’ was used as the strategy for grouping so that errors were allowed between UMIs, but only when there was a count gradient. The allowable number of edits/changes between UMIs was set to 1, and minimum mapping quality to 30 (default).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consensus sequences were called from reads with the same unique molecular tag (CallMolecularConsensusReads) and filtered using FilterConsensusReads to exclude consensus sequences with fewer than two contributing reads, mask consensus bases with quality less than 30, accept a maximum raw-read error rate across the entire consensus read of 0.05, accept a maximum error rate for a single consensus base of 0.1 and accept a maximum fraction of 0.2 for no-calls in the read after filtering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filtered reads were then re-aligned to GRCh38/hg38, and variant calling was performed using Mutect2 (v.4.1.4.1) with a bed file specifying regions of the genome covered by the targeted panel. Normal samples from adjacent muscle were used as matched normal for variant calling. The resulting vcf files were merged for each patient and passed to Platypus (v.0.8.1.1) for multiregion variant calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variant calls were filtered to retain mutations within certain filtering criteria and adequate support for the variant, as described in ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Heide, T. et al.

For validation, we also performed haplotyping on merged bams formed of normal (blood or normal colon tissue) samples and compared the predicted haplotypes. The predicted haplotypes had a high concordance, with haplotypes predicted using all samples providing one more heterozygous haplotype than normal-only haplotypes in 6 of 30 cases.

In addition, we also identified second-tier mutations in unfiltered MuTect files that were detected in insufficient reads to pass quality control, but the exact same nucleotide change was clearly detected in another biopsy of the same tumor, allowing detection in samples with low purity or sequencing coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;LOH in HLA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOH at the &lt;i&gt;HLA&lt;/i&gt; locus was predicted using LOHHLA&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="McGranahan, N. et al.

First, we evaluated the allele-specific copy number as predicted by sequenza (v.2.1.2) at the &lt;i&gt;HLA-A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HLA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;-B&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HLA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;-C&lt;/i&gt; loci. Samples with a predicted minor allele copy number of 0 (for example, 2:0, 3:0) were labeled as candidate LOH. Then, we ran LOHHLA with the polysolver-generated haplotype files and matched tumor–normal pairs as input. A type I allele of a patient was annotated as ‘allelic imbalance’ (AI) if the associated &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value was lower than 0.01. Alleles with AI were labeled as LOH if the following criteria held: (1) the predicted copy number of the lost allele was below 0.5 with confidence interval (CI) strictly below 0.7; (2) the copy number of the kept allele was above 0.75; (3) the number of mismatched sites between alleles was above 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HLA LOH was identified by both methods independently in 18 deep-sequenced samples. HLA LOHs called by only one of the methods were inspected manually. Of LOHHLA-exclusive calls, two were found to be false positives and four were identified as AIs with a minor allele copy number of 1. Of sequenza-exclusive calls, one region showed clear LOH and got classified as HLA LOH; six samples showed similar CN pattern but were missed by LOHHLA due to low purity—as adjacent low-pass sequenced samples showed CN = 1 in the &lt;i&gt;HLA&lt;/i&gt; region, we also classified these as HLA LOH. In addition, 25 regions had allelic imbalance detected by LOHHLA that were also confirmed in sequenza to have a CN state of 2:1 or 3:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Mutations in APGs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assembled a list of genes involved in class I type MHC presentation, by using the KEGG pathway ‘antigen processing and presentation’ and MHC I pathway specifically.

We focused our analysis on SNV neoantigen burden, unless stated otherwise. We also computed the total protein-changing mutation burden, and used this value to obtain the proportional neoantigen burden for each sample, that is, what percentage of mutations that has the potential to create a neoantigen does actually lead to strong-binder neoantigens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Defining clonal/subclonal neoantigens&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assigned clonal/subclonal categories to all mutations (independent of neoantigen status) based on their presence/absence in all available deep- or panel-sequenced sample of a given cancer. As the targeted genome region, sequencing strategy and sample types were different, we created separate mutations lists of FF–WGS and FFPE–PS samples. For FF–WGS samples, mutations present in all sequenced cancer biopsies were denoted as clonal and all other mutations (absent in at least one biopsy) as subclonal. For FFPE–PS samples, mutations present in all biopsies were deemed clonal, and mutations absent in at least two biopsies were denoted as subclonal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22"&gt;Immune dNdS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immune dNdS was computed using SOPRANO&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Zapata, L. et al.

First, the ratio between dNdS inside (ON-target dNdS) and outside the immunopeptidome (OFF-target dNdS) was computed and corrected for 192-trinucleotide context. Then immune dNdS was computed as the ratio of ON-to-OFF dNdS to correct for technical artefacts that could bias dNdS as computed in OFF-target regions. Samples without any ON- or OFF-target synonymous mutations were excluded from the analysis. In total, immune dNdS estimate was available for 61 FF–WGS and 41 FFPE–PS samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compute immune dNdS separately, we first filtered somatic mutation files to only contain mutations annotated as clonal, then repeated the above procedure on these files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23"&gt;SCAA and SCAA loss analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified SCAAs by comparing purity-corrected and copy number-corrected ATAC-seq peak calls of cancer regions (per cancer) to a pool of normal glands&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Heide, T. et al.

For immune escape genes, we filtered SCAAs for those located in promoter or enhancer regions associated with a gene from the list detailed in ‘Mutations in antigen-presenting associated genes.’ Each SCAA was labeled as loss (fold change of cancer compared to normal &amp;lt; −1) or gain (fold change of cancer compared to normal &amp;gt; 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the observed number of SCAA losses, we repeated the analysis 200 times with a set of 25–40 randomly chosen genes and computed the number of SCAA losses and gains. We derived a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value as the number of random samples we observed a value more extreme than for APGs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For neoantigen SCAA loss analysis, we filtered SCAA calls to obtain only losses located in promoter regions (within 1,000 bp of the transcription start site of a gene). Each SCAA loss was annotated by the gene to which they were proximal. As most SCA alterations were found to be clonal, we defined SCAA losses on the cancer level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then evaluated for each protein-alteration mutation within a cancer whether the gene it is in had an associated SCAA loss or not. For each cancer, we computed the proportion of mutations (both for neoantigens and for nonantigenic mutations) that were classified as downstream of a SCAA loss. Similarly, for each SCAA loss in a given cancer, we evaluated whether it was upstream of a protein-changing mutation and, if so, within each cancer, we counted the number of SCAA losses upstream of neoantigen/nonantigenic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;TF analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the TF binding sites obtained from curated human TF motifs in ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Gai, X.-D., Li, C., Song, Y., Lei, Y.-M. &amp;amp; Yang, B.-X.

We then filtered this set to peaks with loss in more than one patient (recurrent SCAA losses), leading to a total of ten genomic regions associated with eight APGs. We identified TFs that are predicted to bind to these regions as those with a binding site in &amp;lt;1,000 bp distance of a given peak, using the distanceToNearest function of the GenomicRanges package in R.

For a mutation to be classified as expressed in a sample, we required three or more RNA reads overlapping the position to support the variant base. For a mutation to be classified as not expressed (that is transcriptionally edited), we required more than ten overlapping reads, with zero supporting the variant. We chose the threshold of more than ten so that the probability of misclassifying a mutation present at a true allele frequency of 0.25 or higher was &amp;lt;5%. Mutation–sample pairs that did not qualify for either of these categories were left blank to signify insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each cancer, we computed the proportion of mutations that had evidence of transcriptional editing (present in WGS but not expressed in RNA-seq) in at least one sample. Similarly, for each mutation in a cancer, we computed the number of samples that expressed that mutation and the number of samples that (confidently) did not express it. We excluded mutations that had sufficient evidence for expressed/not status in fewer than two samples.
