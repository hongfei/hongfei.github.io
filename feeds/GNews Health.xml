While the traditional sweetener often enjoys a reputation for being the healthier pick, the doctor urged viewers to understand what actually happens once these foods enter the bloodstream. His explanation was featured in a video highlighted by an Instagram post, where he broke down myths attached to both ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pal began by addressing a common belief that brown sugar and jaggery are fundamentally different from white sugar. Referring to his demonstration in the video, he explained that brown sugar loses its dark colour when placed in water because the molasses drains out. He emphasised that the body treats most sweeteners the same way. Whether one consumes white sugar, brown sugar, jaggery or any organic variant, the bloodstream converts them into glucose, causing similar spikes in blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_125546725" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-125546725"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Palm Jaggery Gets Some Extra Points&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion, however, did not end with a blanket comparison. Dr Pal noted that palm jaggery has a slight advantage over refined white sugar. As cited from the video, he highlighted that palm jaggery has a lower &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/glycemic-index" target="_blank"&gt;glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This means it raises blood sugar more gradually, offering steadier energy levels. He added that palm jaggery is also more eco friendly because palm trees use less land and water than sugarcane. Its micronutrient content provides an additional edge, though he stressed that this benefit should not be overstated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_125546725" id="div-vdoai-mid-125546725"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clearing Up Confusion About Impurities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video also attempted to put rumours to rest regarding jaggery turning lighter in colour when dissolved. Dr Pal clarified that the whitening is simply the result of impurities dissolving and not evidence of adulteration. He added that this process does not wash away minerals and does not make jaggery unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-125546725" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Moderation Still Rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite acknowledging that jaggery is traditional, flavourful and slightly better than white sugar when consumed in equal amounts, Dr Pal issued a reminder that it remains a form of sugar. People should avoid treating it as a health food. He noted humorously that many avoid white sugar but freely indulge in jaggery, often consuming more than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pal Manickam, widely known for simplifying medical science through his signature blend of humour and explanation, is a board certified gastroenterologist and Director of Preventive Gastroenterology at a California based practice. His work often focuses on gut health, plant based diets and time restricted eating. With a strong social media presence, his content aims to inform the public through an approach that merges comedy with evidence based guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional guidance from nutrition experts underscores that both sugar and jaggery originate from sugarcane and offer similar calorie loads, despite jaggery’s reputation as a natural alternative. According to a recent Redcliffe Labs report, jaggery retains small amounts of minerals, but its high glycemic index means it can still raise blood sugar significantly, making moderation essential for everyone, including people with diabetes. Specialists advise that neither sweetener should be viewed as inherently healthier, and limiting overall intake remains the safest approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:15:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>麻疹病例激增是“火灾警报” ，警告其他疾病可能是下一个- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/surging-measles-cases-are-fire-alarm-warning-diseases-rcna246035</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-090f34" class="body-graf"&gt;The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3372bd" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s crucial to understand why measles matters,” said Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. “Its high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8f2f4" class="body-graf"&gt;That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-424c91" class="body-graf"&gt;"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet," O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/journals/weekly-epidemiological-record" target="_blank"&gt;Weekly Epidemiological Record&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9fc10" class="body-graf"&gt;Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;most in a decade&lt;/a&gt;. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-789004" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ed4bb" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-492538" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination status threatened&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a41910" class="body-graf"&gt;The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-efcaa5" class="body-graf"&gt;Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus — smallpox — has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4b03d" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40cb1f" class="body-graf"&gt;Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08eca5" class="body-graf"&gt;But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9de51f" class="body-graf"&gt;The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4aacd" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-will-us-rcna242630" target="_blank"&gt;Canada met that threshold&lt;/a&gt; this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4fda67" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ac3b8a" class="body-graf"&gt;The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14fe9d" class="body-graf"&gt;Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs "are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a478e" class="body-graf"&gt;Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency "expects those results in the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31fe1c" class="body-graf"&gt;Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbed05" class="body-graf"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna240592" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow. The &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8239eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;state Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51410730/measles-confirmed-in-8-students-at-wasatch-high-utahs-total-eclipses-100-infections" target="_blank"&gt;NBC affiliate KSL&lt;/a&gt; reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54f56" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydralazine"&gt;Hydralazine&lt;/a&gt; has been used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; for many decades, even though it's never been exactly clear how it works. Now a new study answers some key questions about the medication – and adds an intriguing new link to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-7-warning-signs-of-brain-cancer-you-might-easily-miss"&gt;brain cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look at the effects of hydralazine on human and mouse cells, researchers led by a team from the University of Pennsylvania found that it blocks a particular enzyme called 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same enzyme, as it happens, is thought to play a role in aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/brain-tumours/types/glioblastoma"&gt;glioblastoma brain cancers&lt;/a&gt;. This new understanding of hydralazine could lead the way to new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="182732" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments, as well as improve the drug's effectiveness for its current targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/serotonin-could-play-an-unexpected-role-in-cancer-scientists-discover"&gt;Serotonin Could Play an Unexpected Role in Cancer, Scientists Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hydralazine is one of the earliest vasodilators ever developed, and it's still a first-line treatment for preeclampsia – a hypertensive disorder that accounts for 5-15 percent of maternal deaths worldwide," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physician-scientist Kyosuke Shishikura, from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It came from a 'pre-target' era of drug discovery, when researchers relied on what they saw in patients first and only later tried to explain the biology behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182735" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182735" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram.jpg" alt="Cancer action diagram" class="wp-image-182735 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182735" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The ADO enzyme catalyzes reactions that produce hypotaurine, which increases cancer growth. (Shishikura et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers describe ADO as an "alarm bell" that alerts the body to dropping oxygen levels. It triggers a chain reaction, tightening blood vessels by destroying so-called RGS proteins (short for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulator_of_G_protein_signaling"&gt;regulators of G-protein signaling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-020-00398-5"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that glioblastoma tumors are often high in ADO, hijacking it to produce a chemical called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotaurine"&gt;hypotaurine&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the cancer cells spread, survive for longer, and tolerate stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no ADO inhibitors were known prior to this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydralazine effectively mutes ADO, the team found: RGS proteins aren't attacked, blood vessels aren't squeezed, and blood pressure drops. In experiments with human &lt;span&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/span&gt; cells, hydralazine halted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breast-cancer-spreads-more-aggressively-at-night-startling-new-study-finds"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; by blocking ADO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very early days – t&lt;span&gt;he effects of hydralzine still need to be tested in people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-deadliest-kind-of-brain-cancer-may-have-a-promising-new-treatment"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials – &lt;/span&gt;but these are promising findings that could unlock a way to control the spread of these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasal-drops-could-help-fight-a-common-and-deadly-brain-cancer"&gt;notoriously hard-to-treat&lt;/a&gt; brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly uncovered mechanism also explains why hydralazine is an effective treatment for preeclampsia, a high blood pressure condition in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-ages-a-persons-cells-but-some-may-undergo-an-unexpected-rejuvenation"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;. That means the drug can be better engineered and personalized, to reduce side effects and improve results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how hydralazine works at the molecular level offers a path toward safer, more selective treatments for pregnancy-related hypertension – potentially improving outcomes for patients who are at greatest risk," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Megan Matthews, from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries here mean better drugs for both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and brain cancer can now be developed, carefully balancing the need to hit particular pathways in cells while minimizing harm to healthy parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And since hydralazine is already widely used, understanding its mechanism of action gives scientists something of a head start if they want to build more treatments based on the compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, we might be able to take out one of the key defenses of glioblastoma, adding to the treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-therapy-obliterates-deadly-brain-tumor-in-days"&gt;already in development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's rare that an old cardiovascular drug ends up teaching us something new about the brain," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Matthews, "but that's exactly what we're hoping to find more of – unusual links that could spell new solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx7687"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug that originally came into the picture mainly as a treatment for type 2 diabetes and heart disease has now been turned into a mere fat-loss jab. What’s more? After the FDA approval, Ozempic has gotten the much-coveted endorsement — from celebrities, influencers, and many more people who have the power and position to influence common people. In fact, as American singer-songwriter-rapper Lizzo pointed out, there is an Ozempic boom happening now that’s erasing plus-size women from the mainstream spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients at risk of heart disease or diabetes, Ozempic is a necessary prescription medication — yes. But what if there were gentler, more natural ways to tap into some of that drug’s metabolic magic — not with injections or pills, but with everyday foods and herbs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Heliopolis University (Egypt) have drawn attention to a set of plant-based foods and compounds that appear to influence the same gut-hormone pathways targeted by Ozempic. According to their review, ingredients such as ginger, cinnamon, wheat protein, fermented green tea, and the plant compound berberine may help stimulate the release or expression of a hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), which plays a key role in appetite control, digestion speed, and blood-sugar regulation — the very effects for which Ozempic is prized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s spill the beans, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 01:46:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Scorpion Venom可能提供下一个乳腺癌突破-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scorpion-venom-may-provide-the-next-breast-cancer-breakthrough/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Brazil are currently testing to see if the venom of an Amazonian scorpion could be used to poison breast cancer tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of São Paulo’s Preto School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP-USP) have long worked to clone and express proteins from rattlesnake and scorpion venom with hopes of transforming these powerful compounds into medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, their work identified that venom of the scorpion &lt;em&gt;Brotheas amazonicus&lt;/em&gt; appears to attack breast cancer cells in a way similar to a widely used chemotherapy medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These early findings were generated through a collaboration with scientists from the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA) and the Amazonas State University (UEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through bioprospecting, we were able to identify a molecule in the species of this Amazonian scorpion that is similar to that found in the venoms of other scorpions and that acts against breast cancer cells,” &lt;a href="https://sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251117095658.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Eliane Candiani Arantes, a professor at FCFRP-USP and the coordinator of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arantes and her team identified two neurotoxins in scorpion venom with immunosuppressive effects. Working with collaborators at INPA and UEA, they found a peptide named BamazScplp1 in the venom of &lt;em&gt;Brotheas amazonicus&lt;/em&gt; that appears to have anti-tumor potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laboratory tests showed that the peptide’s impact on breast cancer cells was comparable to paclitaxel, a commonly prescribed chemotherapy treatment. It primarily triggers necrosis, a form of cell death previously associated with molecules from other scorpion species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arantes and her team have isolated other components of venoms from scorpions and from snakes that have been used to help develop other clinical applications, including an internal wound sealant that mimics the body’s natural clotting and scaffolding processes. It’s undergoing trials for use in nerve repair, bone healing, and restoring movement following spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you see a scorpion, and think it a nasty creepy crawly that will send you to the hospital, show a bit of grace; they might help save a woman’s life some day.&lt;/p&gt;

suffering from an acute psychotic episode, partly triggered by an underlying brain disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Following a nine-day inquest, jurors found that inadequate testing by staff at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) meant the condition had gone undetected and had "possibly contributed to Mia's death".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0

eZyhnA"&gt;However, a lumbar puncture, which may have revealed she was suffering from the rare disorder autoimmune encephalitis which would have caused the acute psychosis, was not carried

                Fever is part of the immune system's response to a pathogen, one that's shared with many animal species.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For centuries, the nature of a fever — and whether it's good or bad — has been hotly contested.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In ancient Greece, the physician Hippocrates thought that fever had useful qualities, and could cook an illness out of a patient. Later on, around the 18th century, many physicians regarded fever as a distinct illness, one that could actually cook the patient, and so should be treated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These days, researchers understand that fever is part of&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/nx-s1-5580487/immune-health-test-immunome-precision-medicine" target="_blank"&gt; the immune system's response&lt;/a&gt; to a pathogen, one that's shared by many animal species. And while there's accumulating evidence that fevers can help kick an infection, precisely how they can help remains mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There's a cultural knowledge that there's this relationship between temperature and viruses, but at a molecular level, we're quite unsure how temperature might be impacting viruses," says Sam Wilson,&lt;a href="https://www.immunology.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-sam-wilson" target="_blank"&gt; a microbiologist at the University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There are two main ideas, he says. The heat of a fever itself could be harming the virus, akin to Hippocrates' hypotheses. Alternatively, the heat is a means to an end, either stoking our immune system to work better, or simply a regrettable, but unavoidable byproduct of fighting off an infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fact that there weren't definitive answers to these questions piqued my interest," says Wilson. That interest &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq4691?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D82649840174138400580474904999936302642%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1764178729" target="_blank"&gt;led to a study, published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, that suggests — at least in mice — that elevated temperature alone is enough to fight off some viruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reaching this conclusion was tricky, says Wilson, since it's very difficult to disentangle the effects of a fever itself from the immune response that usually comes with it. "The stars had to align," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To put this question to the test, Wilson and his colleagues first needed a pathogen. They settled &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration" target="_blank"&gt;on bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, because birds run hotter than humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The influenza A viruses that infect birds target their guts, which are a few degrees warmer than the airways favored by human influenza viruses. "This means that bird flus are adapted to replicate at a higher temperature, a temperature equivalent to that of a human fever," says Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The researchers pinpointed a part of the bird flu genome that helps the virus thrive in this warm environment, called PB1. They then inserted this heat-tolerant snippet into a human flu virus. This gave them two nearly identical versions of influenza, a normal human one, and a heat-tolerant one.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Those two strains allowed the researchers to ask what impact this ability to replicate at different temperatures might have on disease. They needed an animal to test the question, and laboratory mice turned out to be ideally suited.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It just so happens mice don't mount their own fever to an influenza infection," says Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So the team simulated one by housing some mice at slightly elevated temperatures. Then they exposed the mice to either the normal human influenza virus, or the heat-tolerant version.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under normal laboratory temperatures, mice infected with both strains got sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when the team turned up the heat, a key difference emerged. Mice infected with the heat-resistant strain got sick, but those infected with the normal strain seemed relatively unscathed, suggesting the heat itself helped fight off the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the idea that temperature alone is an important and effective," part of the body's attempt to respond to infection, says Daniel Barreda, &lt;a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/dbarreda" target="_blank"&gt;a microbiologist at the University of Alberta&lt;/a&gt; who wasn't involved in the research. But he says the study doesn't rule out that fever also helps the immune system work better, which could be important for fighting off viruses that aren't as sensitive to temperature as influenza.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Joe Alcock,&lt;a href="https://vivo.health.unm.edu/display/n7040" target="_blank"&gt; an emergency physician and researcher&lt;/a&gt; at the University of New Mexico, also praises the study. But he points out that we shouldn't assume fevers work the same way in humans as they do in mice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, Alcock says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that fever evolved for a reason. As a physician trained by a health care system that's often quick to treat fevers, that gives him pause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We treat fevers as almost like a knee jerk reaction, giving medicines like acetaminophen or tylenol," he says. Of course, in many circumstances treating fever is appropriate, since those high temperatures can damage human cells, too. But he says it should raise questions about when we should reach for Tylenol or ibuprofen when we've got a viral cold.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Is it possible that by taking Tylenol or ibuprofen for a viral infection, that I might be actually making it tougher for my body to get rid of the infection?" says Alcock. "That's as yet an unanswered question."&lt;/p&gt;

They may also attend events related to the commemoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they should “refrain from publicly promoting World Aids Day through any communication channels, including social media, media engagements, speeches or other public-facing messaging”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The email also reportedly said the government’s policy is “to refrain from messaging on any commemorative days, including World AIDS Day”, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; has issued proclamations &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for dozens of other observances&lt;/a&gt;, including World Intellectual Property Day and National Manufacturing Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“An awareness day is not a strategy,” a state department spokesperson, Tommy Piggott, told the New York Times. “Under the leadership of President Trump, the state department is working directly with foreign governments to save lives and increase their responsibility and burden sharing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Every year since 1988, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; has marked 1 December as World Aids Day to honor those who have lost their lives to the disease, to recognize and highlight efforts to contain the epidemic, and to raise awareness among the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, in a cermony on the South Lawn, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; hosted the first White House display of Aids memorial quilt panels memorializing more than 110,000 lives lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since returning to the White House, Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-usaid-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt; foreign aid programs that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/28/usaid-funding-health-development-hiv-aids-antiretroviral-mothers-lgbt-sex-workers-south-africa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; HIV and Aids, scrapped &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/31/trump-administration-hiv-research-grant-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and prevention resources, and restricted &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/hiv-aids-pepfar-christians-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; under the two-decade-old President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, or Pepfar, the government’s global HIV program established under the Republican president George W Bush, which is estimated to have &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prevented 25 million early deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;World Aids Day is usually when the state department shares Pepfar data about cumulative and annual progress with Congress.

&lt;p&gt;Move Over, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/health/what-the-science-says-about-tylenol-autism-ahead-of-rfk-jr-report/"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf596/8339900?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a common — but often overlooked — pregnancy complication may increase your chances of having a child with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/health/the-4-new-subtypes-of-autism-explained/"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news? If you treat it, the risk doesn’t seem to rise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers are exploring how various prenatal conditions might affect the risk of autism.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;pressmaster – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers looked at more than 51,000 women in Israel who gave birth between 2011 and 2017. Of them, 4,409 had abnormal thyroid hormone levels — some before pregnancy, some during and some both. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team followed the women through January 2021 and found that thyroid dysfunction before and during pregnancy more than doubled the chances of their child having autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 31 children age 8 and older in the US&lt;/a&gt; has been diagnosed with ASD, a disorder affecting learning, behavior, communication and social interaction.  &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the longer the thyroid problems lasted, the higher the likelihood of autism became. For example, children whose mothers had low thyroid hormone levels through all three trimesters faced more than three times the risk of being diagnosed with autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s a silver lining: when thyroid problems were properly controlled during pregnancy, the risk didn’t rise significantly.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found that while adequately treated chronic thyroid dysfunction was not associated with increased autism risk in offspring, ongoing imbalance across multiple trimesters was,” &lt;a href="https://www.idanme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Idan Menashe&lt;/a&gt;, a senior lecturer at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and one of the study’s authors, said in &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106734" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland is overactive and produces too many hormones, whereas hypothyroidism occurs when it produces too few. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;amazing studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the front of your neck, just below the Adam’s apple. It produces hormones that regulate your metabolism, energy levels and other vital functions.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Those hormones are also critical for fetal brain development, especially early in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They help neurons grow, move and form connections, which is essential for communication in the brain. Thyroid hormones also support the development of brain structures and the production of myelin, the fatty coating that helps nerve signals travel quickly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thyroid disease — an umbrella term for conditions that affect the gland’s ability to produce hormones — is the second most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When left untreated during pregnancy, thyroid problems have been linked to miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, premature birth, low birth weight and potential long-term effects on the child.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet in the US and many countries, routine thyroid testing isn’t part of standard pregnancy care, according to &lt;a href="https://www.palomahealth.com/learn/tylenol-vaccines-maternal-hypothyroidism-adhd-autism?srsltid=AfmBOor9ZS32uuxEScUiyWLc7LY590y_Bk0YVVphuztRE_9RdGx1pEVH" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Paloma Health&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual clinic specializing in patients with thyroid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Autism is a developmental disorder that can lead to social, communication and behavioral challenges.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ÃÂ¡ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃâÃÂ»ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ° ÃÅÃÂ¸Ãâ°ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂºÃÂ¾ – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors usually only check if a woman has risk factors — like a personal or family history of thyroid problems, autoimmune conditions or past pregnancy complications — or if she shows symptoms like fatigue, weight changes or a rapid heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That leaves a lot of women flying under the radar. In fact, up to 60% of people with thyroid disease don’t even know they have it, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.thyroid.org/media-main/press-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Thyroid Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As a result, many moms-to-be may have untreated thyroid problems, which could put their child at a higher risk for autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the need for routine monitoring and timely adjustment of therapy to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels throughout pregnancy,” Menashe said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Untreated thyroid issues during pregnancy have also been linked to other neurodevelopmental disorders, like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/23/health/1-in-9-us-children-diagnosed-with-adhd/"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0040-1717073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large US study in 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that children whose mothers had underactive thyroids with low hormone levels shortly before or early in pregnancy were 24% more likely to develop ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our findings make clear that thyroid health likely has a much larger role in fetal brain development and behavioral disorders like ADHD than we previously understood,” Dr. Morgan R. Peltier, a professor at NYU Long Island School of Medicine and the study’s lead author, said in &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/reduced-hormone-supply-pregnant-mothers-linked-adhd-their-children"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

A new small but long-term study may have yielded a crucial answer, identifying the metabolite betaine as a key driver of the benefits of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betaine, a small molecule found in foods like sugar beets and spinach, has previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01070"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to improved health, but it hasn't been connected to exercise before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, a team led by researchers from the Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University in China found that long-term exercise boosts levels of betaine in the body, via the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, betaine can mimic some of the beneficial effects of exercise, especially the slowing of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-simple-habits-are-key-to-slowing-aging-experts-reveal"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt; (aka geroprotection). It may be that this molecule could help us live healthier lives for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;One Form of Exercise Improves Sleep The Most, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study gives us a fresh way to turn how our body works into something we can target with chemicals," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251113071620.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biophysicist Liu Guang-Hui, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It opens the door to geroprotective treatments that can tweak how multiple organs work together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183071" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183071" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/LiverPicture.jpg" alt="Liver disease picture" class="wp-image-183071 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/LiverPicture.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/LiverPicture-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183071" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of the effects of betaine in mice was to reduce fat buildup in the liver (right) compared to untreated controls (left). (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1079811"&gt;Guang-Hui Liu's lab&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at the effects of exercise on 13 healthy male volunteers, using an approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics"&gt;multi-omics&lt;/a&gt; to measure changes in the body happening at the most basic levels, across genes, proteins, the immune system, and small molecules such as betaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a single 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) run, the researchers noticed a sharp, short stress response. However, after a month of regular running, there was a more permanent upgrade in several areas, including reduced cell aging and damage, and a healthier gut microbiome and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-discovered-a-special-type-of-immune-cell-that-slows-aging"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key discovery: The kidneys in these volunteers were producing much more betaine. Through tests on mice, the researchers established that betaine blocks an enzyme called TBK1, which has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2016.04.006"&gt;already been linked&lt;/a&gt; to inflammation and aging in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, higher betaine levels aren't just a consequence of sticking to steady, long-term exercise – these chemical boosts are actually a driving force behind some of the benefits that exercise brings with it, especially when it comes to anti-aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study delineated the molecular blueprint through which exercise reshapes human physiology, providing mechanistic insights into its health benefits," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.030"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The identified exercise-induced factors, including betaine, offer potential for developing 'exercise in a pill' to promote healthy aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to acknowledge that the researchers aren't suggesting that we could all soon be popping pills instead of visiting the gym. There are plenty of exercise benefits not covered in this research, including increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-links-muscle-strengthening-activities-to-a-lower-risk-of-dying"&gt;muscle strength&lt;/a&gt; and better &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is the potential to use betaine and the other biological changes discovered here to inform the development of medications that could reduce the risk of age-related disease and keep the body in better shape – whether that's for people getting older or for those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-long-covid-show-abnormalities-in-muscle-structure"&gt;can't exercise&lt;/a&gt; for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more work needs to be done here, in studies across much larger groups of people and covering much longer &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-at-one-stage-of-life-may-cut-dementia-risk-by-up-to-45"&gt;periods of exercise&lt;/a&gt;. But the discovery of betaine's vital role is a promising lead that researchers could explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This redefines 'exercise as medicine'," Guang-Hui &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251113071620.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.030"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The man, who had underlying conditions, died last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest report on bird flu, the WHO said there had been nearly 1,000 outbreaks in humans between 2003 and 2025 ― mainly in Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam, of which 48% had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUMAN PANDEMIC RISK STILL LOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the risk of a human pandemic developing remains low, Gregorio Torres, head of the Science Department at the World Organisation for Animal Health, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be prepared to respond early enough. But for the time being, you can happily walk in the forest, eat chicken and eggs and enjoy your life. The pandemic risk is a possibility. But in terms of probability, it’s still very low,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rameix-Welti also said that if bird flu was to mutate to be able to be transmitted between humans, the world was better prepared than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The positive point with flu, compared to COVID, is we have specific preventative measures in place.
