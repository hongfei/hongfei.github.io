                &lt;p&gt;Scientists are sounding the alarm: this winter’s upcoming flu season in North America could be a real nightmare, thanks to the rapid arrival of a variant that doesn’t match well with the seasonal flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Canada issued the warning in a paper late last month. An unexpected variant of the H3N2 flu, dubbed subclade K, quickly emerged during the tail end of the flu season in the Southern Hemisphere this year, they noted. Subclade K is now poised to become one of the most dominant variants of the flu season in the U.S. and Canada, and it’s likely that our vaccines will be less effective overall this winter against the flu than experts had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While mismatched vaccines can still provide protection against circulating variants, enhanced surveillance is warranted,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A drifting mismatch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the peak of a flu season, multiple variants of influenza A and influenza B viruses will spread between people.  Because it takes about nine months to ramp up enough vaccines for everyone in a given hemisphere, scientists and health authorities meet twice a year (once for the northern half, once for the southern) to predict which variants are most likely to circulate in the population, and thus, which variants a seasonal flu vaccine should cover. Part of this educated guesswork comes from tracking the flu strains moving across the globe at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Usually, the predictions aren’t too far off, and the vaccines will provide at least moderate protection from illness. But flu viruses are always evolving, and variants can gradually develop mutations (a process called drift) that make them significantly different from what scientists had expected them to look like. That seems to be what’s happened here with the latest versions of H3N2, a type of influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, an increasing amount of H3N2 variants with concerning mutations emerged during last winter’s flu season in the northern hemisphere. These variants are perhaps one major reason why the U.S. experienced such a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/flu-cases-are-surging-heres-why-this-season-is-so-unusual-2000561630"&gt;hard-hitting flu&lt;/a&gt; this past winter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More recently, a further drifted and poorly matched lineage of H3N2—subclade K—emerged toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere. This lineage is now “projected to predominate among A(H3N2) viruses for the NH 2025–2026 season,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The possibility remains that subclade K will not spread widely in North America, since there will be other circulating variants of flu around at the same time. But the odds of that aren’t looking too good. In the UK, health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge"&gt;already announced&lt;/a&gt; an early start to its flu season, with a majority of these cases being caused by subclade K. Hospitals in the region are now preparing for a big surge of flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth wondering whether the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/irreparably-damaged-former-senior-official-details-the-darkest-days-of-the-cdc-under-rfk-jr-2000673201"&gt;fractured state of public health&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. will further hamper efforts to contain the flu. President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have overseen dramatic funding cuts and layoffs throughout the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies this year, while RFK Jr. has fired or pressured senior health officials to leave the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why vaccines still matter&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the dire outlook, vaccines remain one of the most important tools against the flu this season. There are other strains of flu that the vaccine will cover, and a mismatched vaccine can still provide some protection against the worst outcomes of flu, which can include death. Thankfully, there is good news on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week, the UK Health Security Agency &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;the latest data from its flu surveillance program. Even with a mismatched variant in the picture, the vaccine is currently estimated to be 70% to 75% effective at preventing flu hospitalizations in children and 30% to 40% effective in adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These results provide reassuring evidence that this season’s flu vaccines currently offer important protection to children and adults, despite concerns about the new subclade,” said Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for Immunization at UKHSA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So it’s still worthwhile to get your flu shot as soon as you can. But given the mismatch this winter, it’s all the more important to practice good hygiene, to stay home if you’re sick, and to potentially wear a mask in higher-risk situations for added protection (well-fitting, high-quality masks such as a KN95 or N95 being the most effective).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 21:10:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPbzJ3V0kweWo3b2JrNmk0QTY5M2hHWThzV1h3Zk9aRUVEQjZjZElpYUZ3d1Z6MlpDNm0wWXl0Y3V4RHJvUVlyYkl4RzI4SGhPQmdUcFdoejZWX3VCOVVDcHJCZUt6MVRrakUwMGdEb2NxbXRZQi11NkpqR1FqMXdYblRPeXdzbldMa1JZcXg5OThDemkxTXA2RmNtNzhjd2Z6Rkdpam9pNnY</guid></item><item><title>随着关闭的结束，可疑的CDC小组重新开始拆除疫苗接种计划- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/as-shutdown-ends-dubious-cdc-panel-gets-back-to-dismantling-vaccine-schedule/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Kennedy’s ACIP members planned to push the first dose back a month. A vote was prepared to recommend &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;giving a birth dose unless there was “individual based decision-making.” While at first the panel seemed poised to vote in favor of the change, the plan collapsed with basic questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting ACIP member Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist, noted: “I’m unclear if we’ve been presented with any safety or data comparing before one month to after one month,” he said. They had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And,” Hibbeln continued, “I’m wondering why one month was selected as our time point and if there are data to help to inform us if there’s greater risk of adverse effects before one month or after one month at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no data suggesting that such a move would be more or less safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion quickly spiraled from there with an eventual vote of 11-1 to table voting on the vaccine recommendation. According to the Federal Register notice, ACIP will try to take up the topic again. They could revive the vote or attack some other aspect of vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pediatricians fight back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts have blasted Kennedy’s lineup and their attacks on childhood vaccines, including the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. The current schedule “remains the best protection against serious health problems like liver disease and cancer,” the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasized to Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ACIP’s standing tarnished under Kennedy, AAP has put forth its own evidence-based vaccine schedule for pediatricians to trust. They’ve also been a prominent opponent among medical organizations to Kennedy’s efforts. For instance, in &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.286605/gov.uscourts.mad.286605.139.0.pdf"&gt;a revised federal lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, the AAP along with other medical organizations is seeking to overturn all decisions made by Kennedy’s ACIP and replace the entire panel with actual experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s appointees “lack the credentials and experience required of their role,” and all their votes should be declared “null and void,” the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAP President Susan Kressly &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682/Updated-AAP-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-ACIP-members"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that pediatricians are already seeing the effects of having an anti-vaccine activist as the US health secretary, namely “fear, decreased vaccine confidence, and barriers for families to access vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The nation’s children are already paying the price in avoidable illnesses and hospitalizations,” Kressly said. “We urge federal leaders to restore the science-based deliberative process that has made the United States a global leader in public health. Urgent action is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

"They have not knowingly had contact with anyone who had measles, which means their infection is the result of transmission somewhere out in the community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department said epidemiologists are working quickly to notify anyone the patient may have exposed and all personal contacts of the infected individual have already been notified individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, health officials say the patient visited one public location while they were infectious and people who were at the following location during the indicated date and times may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taylorsville InstaCare, 3845 W. 4700 South, on Friday, Nov. 7, from 3 p.m. to 7:15 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials in October &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51397304/salt-lake-county-identifies-its-first-probable-case-of-measles-amid-nationwide-outbreak" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; what they believed was the first case of measles reported in the county, but they were unable to confirm the diagnosis because the patient declined to participate in their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient has declined to be tested or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact," Adams said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread to as many as nine out of 10 unprotected people who are near an infected person, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; County officials say two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are the best way to prevent infection and limit the severity of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but cases this year have spiked nationwide to the highest level since then. Utah has reported 77 confirmed cases this year, the majority in southwest Utah, according to the state's Measles Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically manifest seven to 14 days after infection. They include fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, according to the department. Patients with measles typically have tiny white spots appear inside their mouth two to three days after symptoms begin and get a rash within three to five days of the first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will need hospitalization, according to the department, with young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who suspect they may have been exposed to measles are asked to contact their health care provider immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Instead, it says that “treatment is limited to supportive care”, including rest and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Ethiopia was reported in the country’s southern region of Omo, which borders South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya said on Thursday that the outbreak was a concern because “&lt;a href="/where/south-sudan/"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; isn’t far and has a fragile health system”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other African country has reported Marburg virus cases in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tedros, the WHO chief, said on Friday that the UN agency was “actively supporting Ethiopia to contain the outbreak and treat infected people, and supporting all efforts to address the potential of cross-border spread”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian Ministry of Health also said that community-wide screenings were being conducted in relation to the outbreak, alongside efforts to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people have been isolated and are being treated, it said in a statement shared on social media, while work to identify anyone who may have come into contact with suspected cases was also under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry urged people not to panic, to follow instructions from the health authorities, and to seek medical care if they exhibit any signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:56:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOTU96Yk5nRHgwU0VmdlowU0d1ekdjV0lQdUdpc1phQ0tJaTdrelVXckRlR0NlRGNKd0tLR3VsLU9nbkJMYmtZVGlyOGxSZGctQ1k0VDNYUzZqYkx6NFZxcTFyeFV6dDZ4TlRzRTBBQVdZVnNMRmdnMlBfRk9aZ2ZpSXhxajZTcFdWcWJRb2tEcm05OWFDdGfSAZsBQVVfeXFMUFV2eXBTcW5ZYkdFcnE3cUxmRTdSZjhRX3dGVENJMjhmZUNiR3EzYXMzOGowMDZjTzVnWkdCRDVMQ1BLYUg0Skc2aUt6dGJDV01DRVhPWmlud1lWVzUxVHJMdUtURkh1cHpPNTZ1S1ZfVnpsVWQtNUd3WlpPMHhtYXNkV2NLUG5jdGF4Tld1d2VuYmt5bG8zblNBVTQ</guid></item><item><title>9个月内首例美国人类禽流感病例确诊，以前仅在动物身上见过- abcnews.go.com</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/suspected-human-bird-flu-case-1st-us-9/story?id=127519769</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A Washington state resident has tested positive for bird flu, marking the first human case confirmed in the U.S. in nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The patient, who is an older adult with underlying health conditions, developed symptoms including high fever, confusion and respiratory distress and was hospitalized in early November, according to the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Testing confirmed the patient has H5N5, a strain of bird flu that has previously been reported in animals but never before in humans, according to the Washington State Department of Health.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="194" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zkjw000vphkwiotsjdm5@published"&gt;My 67-year-old dad has been sick with a rare cancer since 2017. Without going too much into the saga of his surgeries/treatments, it’s been a battle with many ups and downs. Up until more recently, he was managing well and able to do most of the activities that he loves to do, including spending time with his grandchildren. He has become very thin and weaker than ever before, with frequent exhaustion that requires a lot of rest. There are no more treatment options, and it’s unclear what the management looks like from here. There is no formal prognosis, but I fear that the rate things are going he does not have a lot of time left. My mom, who has been his caretaker, is also exhausted and emotionally drained from this. My question revolves around talking about this with my son, “Freddie.” Freddie just turned 4, and because my dad has mostly been able to do regular things with us when we visit (we live four hours away by car), I’ve never actually told him that his grandpa is sick. It seemed way too complicated to discuss with him, especially before he was 4.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz7nms200113b78qrc88l86@published"&gt;How do you prepare a young child for the passing of their grandparent? Do I even discuss it with him yet? We have not really had an official conversation about death before, outside of seeing roadkill or a bug being squished. We haven’t talked about dying in regards to people. I don’t want to talk about it too soon, because I know it would take away from the time that he does spend with my dad, not to mention make my dad feel uncomfortable or sad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zt6v000b3b78o7di9egd@published"&gt;But would waiting make it more difficult? Freddie is very social with great language skills and a mind like a steel trap, and I know if I were to discuss something with him, he’d likely talk about it with or in front of grandma/grandpa. I’m also trying to emotionally prepare myself for losing my dad, something that seemed like a death sentence almost 10 years ago, and it feels incredibly heavy and weighs on my mind a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zthq000e3b780qvxa2t4@published"&gt;You’re doing such a good job, and you should continue to follow your gut here. I think it’s been the right move to avoid talking about your dad’s illness with your son, and I think you should put it off as long as you can. What a gift, in a time of pain and anxiety, to have a child who is oblivious to it. Give your dad and yourself (and your son!) this gift as long as it keeps making sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztju000f3b7830m15q4e@published"&gt;It’s likely that pretty soon, Freddie will notice that something is different, and there will be something material that you can talk about with him. For example, if your dad follows the usual trajectory of a person with untreatable cancer, his energy will continue to decrease. He’ll stop leaving the house, then stop leaving his bed. Whether you and Freddie are doing video calls or in-person visits, these are things that your son will notice, and you can talk to him about it. Keep your explanations simple and straight-forward. So you might say, “We’re going to visit grandpa, and he’s going to be in his bed because he’s very sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztmu000g3b789dhc4ie0@published"&gt;You don’t need to tell Freddie that granddad is dying—wait to tell him about death until your dad has died. I know you’re worried about “preparing” him, but as you’re finding, even adults can’t really “prepare” ourselves for the death of our loved ones. Even once your dad goes on hospice, it could be weeks or months before he dies—everyone’s timeline is their own. That uncertainty is going to be hard enough for you; protect your son from it, if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztoa000h3b786m0c5kxa@published"&gt;When your dad does die, use simple language to tell your son, something like: “Grandpa died, it means we can’t see him or talk to him anymore, but we can talk about him and look at pictures and know that he loved us very much.” And it’s OK to be sad about it with him! He’ll have a lot of questions, and again, just be a straightforward and honest as possible. And it’s OK to say, “I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz752sd000p3b78udugvyzb@published"&gt;It can really help  to read about how other people have handled these conversations, because you’ll see that there is no “one right way.” You might also find language that resonates with you. This &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1fwsnju/please_help_me_explain_death_to_my_4_year_old_one/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; has some really thoughtful responses.

And of course, our columnists have written on this topic in the past: &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/talk-children-death-advice.html"&gt;Allison Price&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/01/funerals-grief-education-opportunity-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;Nicole Cliffe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/05/parenting-advice-for-a-grandpa-who-must-explain-death-to-his-grandson-and-a-mom-who-doesnt-want-to-deliver-a-hat.html"&gt;Carvell Wallace&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/07/parenting-advice-how-to-handle-end-of-life-care-with-kids-in-the-house.html"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;).

In the mornings, I have to literally dress him and get him to the car ASAP when we leave for his daycare, because if I leave him unattended for so much as a minute, everything comes off and I have to start all over. His daycare has had some success in keeping him clothed, but if they don’t watch him carefully he’ll soon be wearing his birthday suit. It’s getting to the point where they have said he will not be able to come back if the problem isn’t resolved. My husband thinks that since the weather is getting colder, the solution is to let him go outside without his clothes on so he can “learn what they’re for.” I’m not willing to risk him getting hypothermia just to prove a point. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

We don’t &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;wear clothes to keep us warm in the cold. We wear them because, in our society, it’s an universal rule, in public and in many private businesses (like daycares!), that we wear clothes that cover our bodies. Also: Many kids feel temperature differently, and it’s entirely possible your son could go out in the cold naked and be perfectly comfortable and undeterred in the least. He might also get hypothermia, so like, let’s just nip that one in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz89prq00193b78vol1slit@published"&gt;You’re on a daycare deadline, so Instead of trying to make a behavior change, I think you’ve got to make a clothes change and dress him in clothes that he can’t take off—the most common suggestion I’ve seen for this is one-piece pajamas worn backwards, so the zips or snaps are in the back. And while you’re at it, I’d make sure the ones you’re picking are soft, breathable, and don’t have tags inside in case he’s stripping because his clothes are uncomfortable. (Often, brands label these as “sensory friendly.”) You might have to try several options, but hopefully you can get one that he’ll tolerate (I expect that he’ll try to take anything off at first, but will soon move on.) I think this will be a blip. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zkjw0015phkwtywk3c3y@published"&gt;Is there such a thing as taking too many pictures of your kids? My husband, who is a great father, is really fanatical about taking photos of our only child, a 3-year-old girl. He takes pictures of her CONSTANTLY. He thinks it’s important to document every day, so he’ll take a minimum of 10 photos daily, along with a few short videos. That’s just on an average day. If anything remotely interesting happens—a new toy, an outing, a new skill—he’ll take dozens of photos and 10–20 minutes of video. He has videos of her &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/childhood-photos-too-many-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;singing every song she knows, every word she tries to say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At her largest she hit 230lbs, classifying her as morbidly obese for her 5ft 2in frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came her moment of humiliation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was explaining to an overweight patient how he could lower his blood pressure naturally by slimming down,when he snapped back: 'Well, you go first.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was kind of snickering at me,' Dr Booth &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-3fb08090-c17d-11f0-8556-6fe7e2457a06"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And these awkward encounters became more frequent, with patients pointing out Dr Booth's hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Brittany Booth, pictured left at 320lbs and right today, lost half her body weight over two years after following a diet plan that saw her consume virtually no carbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many overweight people, she had tried every fad diet under the sun, but had always abandoned efforts after being disappointed by slow progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It didn't help that she was prone to comfort eating, often consuming half a tub of ice cream a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the embarrassing encounters with her patients gave her a new determination to shed the weight and she made herself a promise - in August 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I decided I didn't care how long it took or how slow the progress was, I was determined to get healthy again,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What followed was a two-year struggle that eventually saw her lose a total of 120lbs - at a pace of about 1lb a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine years on, and now 41, Dr Booth &lt;span&gt;has succeeded in keeping the fat off and today weighs around 110lbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And she has done it all without the use of weight-loss drugs - instead changing her diet and introducing moderate exercise into her routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She began by sifting through online diet plans and quickly noted a striking trend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She learned that &lt;/span&gt;America's obesity problem had begun in the early 1980s, around the time US dietary guidelines promoting a low-fat, high-carb diet were introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back then, around 15 percent of Americans were obese, estimates suggest, compared to more than 40 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say few people actually followed the 'low-fat, high-carb' advice, but the guidelines prompted food companies to reformulate their products, cutting fat and adding sugar or refined carbs to make foods taste better and appear 'healthier'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We now know, however, that carbs &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4742721/#:~:text=Abstract,fat%20may%20contain%20more%20sugar."&gt;lead to weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, not fats - though many fad diets have not kept pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;So Dr Booth decided to flip the script and switched to her own low-carb, high-fat plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She largely focused on healthy, unsaturated fats found in olive oil, fatty fish and, at lower levels, in beef and pork. Doctors now say these can help to improve cholesterol, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth followed a plan where she ate no carbs for six out of seven days of the week, only meat and vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She did not count her calories and still ate three meals a day, filling her plate with greens and ensuring every meal contained a fist-sized portion of meat for protein - including bacon, chicken, pork and even burgers without the bun&lt;span&gt;. For snacks, she had nuts or cheese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also gave up those daily ice cream binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth also started to incorporate more exercise into her day, steering clear of running or weightlifting, but using other strategies such as parking further away from the office to walk more and talking the stairs instead of the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Booth started her weight loss journey in August 2014 after she noticed some patients snickering at her. She has managed to keep the weight off for nine years after reaching her goal weight in August 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight loss was slow compared to those on weight-loss drugs, and there were some weeks where she did not lose any weight or even gained a few pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to her 1lb-per-week loss, people who turn to Ozempic, Wegovy or similar drugs, typically lose around double the amount of weight every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, she was also juggling work and caring for her children - and because her kids were fussy eaters, she had to make two meals every night, one for herself and another for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, back in 2014, Ozempic was not available when Dr Booth started losing weight. Now, she says, she would definitely have used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added that by not resorting to weight-loss drugs she was able to built habits that have allowed her to both lose weight and keep it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only about 20 percent of people who come off weight-loss drugs manage to maintain their slimmer frame, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13006179/ozempic-wegovy-patients-weight-stopping-drugs.html"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly one in five regain all the weight they have lost and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors say this is likely because they did not also build the healthy habits that would help them to maintain the weight loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think I am happy with the way I lost the weight because it shows that you do it on your own. I think it gives me a little more credibility even,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have this standard now, right now with GLP-1s, where you can lose like ten pounds a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But rapid weight loss is not healthy in general, because it can lead to other medical problems.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Booth said her weight rose, in part, because she would binge eat ice cream and would use it both as a reward and to relieve stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your body is like an equilibrium, and when you are shifting fat cells and fluids and all of the other components of weight loss, your body has to readjust,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're losing massive amounts of weight too quickly, it can be really dangerous. And then, there is, of course, the cosmetic side of it. You're going to get saggy skin, you're going to get wrinkles. It doesn't look good when you lose weight too quickly. And, also, you lose a lot of muscle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that rapid weight loss involving a very restrictive diet can also lead to nutrient deficiency, muscle loss, fatigue, loose skin and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth said she was '100 percent certain' that the slow weight loss allowed her skin to retract much better than in many Ozempic patients, although she still needed to have some surgery to remove the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I literally lost a whole person. So, I did have some extra skin around my tummy and some extra skin around my arms, and I did have that removed, although it wasn't really necessary; it was purely cosmetic,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reaching her goal weight, Dr Booth went on to build her own weight-loss clinic, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bodybybarker.com/#"&gt;Body by Barker&lt;/a&gt;, in York, Pennsylvania. Dr Booth's middle name is Barker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general, people take my advice more seriously now, and specifically when I am coaching on weight,' she said. 'They consider me something of an expert because I have done it all myself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet, libraries and bookshops are full of plans and advice on how to lose weight, from fad diets to intense exercise routines. But there could be another route to keeping the pounds away, and that's with a gut bacterium called Turicibacter.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, around 1 in 8 people are living with obesity. This global crisis can cause significant health complications and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. For years, scientists have known that our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-gut-microbiome-brain-bodies.html" rel="related"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; (the trillions of microbes in our digestive system) play a role in our overall health, including how we process fat. But pinpointing the exact beneficial microbes and how they help us has been much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fat-fighting microbe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, new research has identified Turicibacter in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; as a key player, a bacterium long suspected of influencing fat metabolism. In a paper &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413125004413" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, scientists detail exactly how it exerts its protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kendra Klag at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City and her colleagues first isolated the specific Turicibacter bacterium from other microbes. Then they tested its protective effects on different groups of mice, including those bred without any existing gut bacteria and standard lab mice. The mice were fed either a regular diet or a high-fat diet, and some were also given the bacterium as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then measured key health metrics, including body fat, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+sugar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and blood fat levels. They found that Turicibacter drastically reduced obesity and improved metabolic health even in mice on a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how Turicibacter was doing this, the team analyzed mouse gut and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; and found that the bacteria were producing their own lipids (fat molecules). They purified these bacterial fats and gave them to the mice, and observed that they alone (without the bacteria) were enough to prevent obesity. These lipids helped suppress the body's production of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-unexpected-lipid-obesity-therapies.html" rel="related"&gt;ceramides&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fat that builds up when an individual has a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-fat+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data identify a novel bacterial-host lipid network that promotes host metabolic health and holds therapeutic promise," wrote the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the research has people wondering whether gut bacteria could be our new weapon against obesity. The idea is not that far-fetched. The researchers also found that low levels of Turicibacter are linked with obesity in humans, which could pave the way for probiotic supplements to treat the metabolic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eating ultra-processed foods could lead to an increased risk of being diagnosed with precancerous colorectal growths for women under 50, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2841354" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published Thursday in JAMA Oncology, looked at health outcomes for 29,105 nurses under 50 who underwent at least one colonoscopy. Participants were followed from June 1991 until June 2015 and filled out questionnaires about their eating habits every four years. The researchers looked at two forms of precancerous polyps: adenomas and serrated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who had an average of three ultra-processed food servings per day had a 3% risk of a precancerous polyp, while women who had an average of 10 or more ultra-processed food servings per day had a 5% risk, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 5% of adenomas are cancerous, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15370-colon-polyps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but about 75% of colorectal cancers start as these growths. The study did not find any links between ultra-processed foods and serrated lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do see an increase in risk with more servings of ultra-processed food products," said CBS News medical contributor Dr. Céline   Gounder, the editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods account for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-calories-ultra-processed-foods-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the average American's diet, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even though most dietary guidelines recommend restricting them. Ultra-processed foods have also been linked to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ultra-processed-food-health-issues-cancer-early-death-research/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;dozens of other health issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, including diabetes, sleep issues, heart trouble and early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who ate more ultra-processed foods also had a higher body mass index, and were more likely to have a history of smoking, according to the research. They also tended to have lower levels of physical activity and consume fewer nutrients like fiber and Vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if there are any good ultra-processed foods," Gounder said. "Clearly the more you're eating, the worse for your health, the higher the risk for various complications." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-are-they-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;don't have a set definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but they often include packaged foods and beverages, items made without many whole ingredients, and less obvious products like condiments and sauces. Study participants who had diets higher in sugars and artificial sweeteners, as well as packaged savory snacks, had higher rates of adenoma development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government has said it is planning to define ultra-processed foods, Gounder said. In the meantime, a "good rule of thumb is: if you can't pronounce an ingredient on the package, it is probably an ultra-processed food," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still working to determine exactly how ultra-processed foods affect the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that the ultra-processed foods are changing your microbiome, so those are the bacteria in your gut. So that causes increased inflammation, it can cause increased permeability of the gut wall," Gounder said. "And then secondly, we know ultra-processed foods are associated with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes which we also know increase the risk of various cancers, including perhaps colon cancer." &lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who was at the &lt;b&gt;Taylorsville InstaCare&lt;/b&gt; location at &lt;b&gt;3845 West 4700 South&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt;November 7&lt;/b&gt; between &lt;b&gt;3 p.m. and 7:15 p.m.&lt;/b&gt; may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if those at the InstaCare location did not have direct contact with the infected patient, they remain at risk because measles can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Taylorsville location during the timeframe shared by the health department is being urged to confirm their measles immunity status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday morning, 74 measles infections have been confirmed across the state of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccine recommendations:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children&lt;/b&gt; should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults born before 1957&lt;/b&gt; generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated before 1968&lt;/b&gt; should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963–1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later&lt;/b&gt; are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, healthcare workers, international travelers) should have two doses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

We’d like to try it, but we’ve always been told how unsafe it is.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnxoct00383b78mzdgq549@published"&gt;We’ve noticed there’s more and more “ass to pussy.” How do the women who do it in porn do it? Do they gobble antibiotics? Do they have secrets for cleaning out really well? Do they just suffer with infections for the sake of a paycheck? Or is it not really as unsafe as we’re told?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwn001z3b78to66am6j@published"&gt;I don’t think the best question here is how adult performers with vaginas mitigate the risks of transferring anal bacteria to those vaginas. Everyone has their own tricks and tips. Many of these methods are medically unsound. Adult is pretty crucial to the adult film industry—there are mountains of paperwork to prove that everyone is of age—so performers are considered able to weigh the risks, the financial pressures, and their own boundaries to make their own decisions. Much like you and your girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwn00203b782w67qdle@published"&gt;Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the associate medical director at Planned Parenthood, has the answer to your last and most relevant question: “Unfortunately, transitioning from anal penetrative sex directly to vaginal penetrative sex can lead to vaginal infections. It’s important to understand that while the vagina has lots of bacteria, the GI tract has much more bacteria and different bacteria that shouldn’t be present in the vagina, and this can lead to infections in the vagina that can be difficult to treat.” The risks are significant: “In worst case scenarios, an infection of this time can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which is when a vaginal infection progresses to the uterus or fallopian tubes.” Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause permanent damage, including fertility problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnts2l00343b78aapt0yuo@published"&gt;There are some ways you can mitigate this, but most aren’t all that helpful. “Things like anal douching before anal sex or washing fingers, toys, or penis after anal sex can reduce this risk, and help might avoid an infection every time, but the infection risk is still high,” De-Lin said. Since I expect the lure of something risky, or forbidden, or whatever it is that interests you about inserting your penis into your girlfriend’s vagina directly after being in her asshole, is strong enough for you to write in, I’m hoping De-Lin’s last suggestion will suffice: “The best bet is to use a new condom when transitioning from anal to vaginal sex, or make sure that the progression is from vaginal to anal instead.”&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever I would see my partner in person, we rarely had sex unless we had been drinking. I chalked this up to the stress of traveling, the stress in the relationship, etc. Now that I’ve left the relationship and am dating again, I’m finding that I still have a hard time getting over the nerves of sleeping with someone without alcohol. I’m bisexual and have noticed this showing up no matter the gender of the person I’m on a date with. I otherwise have a healthy relationship with alcohol and drinking culture. I’m 28 and sloppy drunk first-time hookups feel juvenile now, but how the hell am I supposed to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

Did you refrain from going home together? Did you stop the sex? Engage in heavy sexual interaction and not find it satisfying? Regardless, as you try to hook up without it, just like medical marijuana packages advise, start low and go slow.&lt;/p&gt;

You can find the edge of anxiety—that blurred space where you’re a little past your comfort zone but you’re able to stay present and engaged—and hang out there for a while. Take some deep breaths. Exist in the moment. If you start to check out, call for a stop and do something that grounds you. For some people, that’s holding ice, or biting a lemon. For others, it’s a mental exercise or even a physical one. Whatever you have to do to inhabit your body and get back into the present. If checking out is a thing that you notice recurring, that’s something you’ll need to warn your partners about. Instead of a safeword, you’ll want them to understand that an absence of positive feedback means they should stop what they’re doing and disengage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="183" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwq002g3b78zdis1fr9@published"&gt;I really don’t understand how these conversations go in which an interest is revealed without a plan of attack. Did he just, like, grunt as he motioned in the general area of his balls? Truth be told, I have no idea what your boyfriend wants you to do with his balls. He might like them pulled. He might like them sucked. He might like you to pop ’em in your mouth like little bits of breaded chicken or lap at them so lightly as though you’re catching snow with your tongue. Ask him. If you’re too embarrassed, go down and start kissing them gently, maybe licking them for bit and wait for him to direct you. If he doesn’t, ask him if he likes what you’re doing after a few minutes. If he still doesn’t have anything to add, it could mean one of two things: You can do whatever and he’ll be happy (in that case, rejoice: An easy-going partner is a gift), or he’s not such a ball play connoisseur after all and it still doesn’t really matter what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

It has taken us to some unexpected, yet interesting places, and I’ve done things I never would have agreed to had we discussed it ahead of time.

The gel fills holes and cracks in the teeth when applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The gel was able to grow crystals epitaxially, which means it's in the same crystallographic orientation as existing enamel," Alvaro Mata, a professor in Biomedical Engineering and Biomaterials at the University of Nottingham, told &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2502731-cavities-could-be-prevented-by-a-gel-that-restores-tooth-enamel/?" target="_self"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com%22,%22target%22:%22_blank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Add%20CNET%22%7D" target="_self"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; as a preferred Google source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enamel is the hard layer of the tooth that shields the softer inner layers from damage caused by general wear and tear, acid and bacteria.

In a separate email interview with CNET, Mata explained how long he expects the gel to last. "The gel is biodegradable, and the process to remineralize takes approximately two weeks.  It is applied once, and it will endure as native enamel would, depending on people's health habits." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research shows it works on heavily damaged enamel &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical and thermal insults," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/new-gel-restores-dental-enamel-and-could-revolutionise-tooth-repair" target="_self"&gt;said Abshar Hasan&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow and leading author of the study. "When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural, healthy enamel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process was effective even when the enamel was severely worn and the dentine below was exposed, according to the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata said he believes the gel can be used as a preventative solution to avoid dental fillings, although dentists we spoke with are more cautiously optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If used as a preventive solution, it can avoid getting to the dental filling stage," said Mata. "In a way, it needs to be managed as a chronic disease where patients need to start at home with more education and care. Having said this, we have been working on this for 16 years, which has allowed us to develop quite a bit of know-how to understand, control and shape the technology. Because of this, we now have a versatile technology that will derive into multiple types of products. I believe that in the future, dental fillings will be a possibility." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata says he's "very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable." He's started a startup called Mintech-Bio and hopes to have the first product out next year, according to New Scientist, following the clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dentists are cautiously optimistic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNET reached out to several dentists to get their perspective on the gel.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bianca Velayo, a general dentist in Henderson, Nevada, and multipractice owner at &lt;a href="https://www.pdshealth.com/" target="_self"&gt;PDS Health&lt;/a&gt;, was cautious about the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dental materials like this rarely hit the market overnight, even with exciting results," she says. "After early lab success, the real test is how it performs in the human mouth under real-world conditions: heat, saliva, bacteria, diet and daily habits. Between lab research, multiple trial phases and regulatory approval, it usually takes five to 10 years before we'd see a material like this in everyday dental use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Velayo also says she's excited about the prospect of these replacing traditional dental fillings in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gel hints at the future of dentistry, where we could actually regrow what's been lost. It's the difference between repairing and truly healing the tooth," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another dentist and multipractice owner at PDS Health, Ahmad Mokbil, said that the treatment has potential, but he doesn't believe it'll be possible anytime soon, as it requires a shift in educating patients, dentists, dental coverage and treatment protocols. However, he pointed to existing technology that's in use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We use an FDA-approved treatment called Curodont, which has similar characteristics and is effective for treating early tooth decay," Mokbil said. "The number of applications required can vary depending on how the tooth responds, the size of the cavity and how early the intervention takes place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNQkR2Z0tjNXliOXdFTVZLVnNTbDZGa0hSazhRS1g5OUlXb1lmWm5TOWhYa1J2UGk1MDQ5eXBXTUFQMWNQZ1dqeGpoLWhiV1hhRGFOYXZOZHMwb0t0TDRqV3lMZUgxdlBicFdYVkItUHljMkdER1lBMWJFMzJpUzRSMFNwTUxYQmdRbDJteXlSMVJvcC1TTmdObFBxLTZ5TlV3cTg3dFhQZw</guid></item><item><title>新研究发现脑肿瘤中的细菌在癌症生长中起着“令人惊讶”的作用-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-study-finds-bacteria-in-brain-tumors-play-surprising-role-in-cancer-growth/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Newly published research in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-025-01073-3"&gt;Nature Cancer&lt;/a&gt; suggests that bacteria inside brain tumors may play a far more active role in how cancers grow, spread and respond to treatment than previously understood, according to Prof. Ravid Straussman of the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists considered tumors as places where bacteria didn’t grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But now we know that bacteria live inside tumors and can change how cancer cells behave and how fast they grow and spread,” Straussman told The Times of Israel. “The realization that diverse bacterial populations may play a role in cancer compels us to rethink our assumptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking findings raise the possibility that bacteria play a more active role in cancer progression and the infiltration of metastases into the brain than scientists had previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Certain bacteria can make cancer cells more resistant to chemotherapy,” Straussman said. “Patients with more bacteria in their brain tumors tended to have poorer survival outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="New study finds bacteria in brain tumors play ‘surprising’ role in cancer growth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctoral student Elinor Gigi, assisted by staff scientist Dr. Nancy Gavert from Straussman’s lab, led the research in collaboration with Prof. Shlomit Yust-Katz, head of the Neuro-Oncology Unit at Rabin Medical Center, and Dr. Ayelet Shai, director of the Breast Oncology Unit at Rambam Health Care Campus. Scientists from Hebrew University, Northwestern University and Baylor College of Medicine also participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how bacteria interact with cancer cells opens new possibilities for better, more targeted therapies for brain tumors,” Straussman said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bacteria are present in ‘all types of brain tumors’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the differences in bacteria in glioblastomas, which are aggressive primary brain tumors that originate in the brain itself, and brain metastases — secondary tumors that originate in other parts of the body, such as the lung and breast, and then spread to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“We found that bacteria are present in all types of brain tumors we examined,” Straussman said. “Interestingly, brain metastases contained a higher diversity and abundance of bacteria compared to glioblastomas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Straussman’s group reported finding bacteria inside cancer cells taken from the bone, breast, lung, ovary, pancreas, colon and skin. The scientists also found bacteria in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was quite surprising because the brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier, a selective and semipermeable shield that normally prevents bacteria from entering the brain,” Straussman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some bacteria might travel inside cancer cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the scientists analyzed 322 samples of glioblastoma and brain metastases and found bacteria both inside cancer cells and within nearby immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3688041" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/4-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3688041" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/4-1-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Glioblastoma tumor tissue removed from a patient and immediately incubated in a solution containing an amino acid consumed only by bacteria.

On the right, after antibiotic treatment, amino acid uptake ceased. (Courtesy/Weizmann Institute of Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists observed that about 40 to 50 percent of the bacteria in brain metastases were similar to those found in the patients’ primary lung or breast tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that some bacteria might travel inside cancer cells from the primary site as they metastasize to the brain. The bacteria might also have metabolic traits that could help them promote cell migration, tissue invasion, and tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;h3&gt;Location of the brain tumor matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the researchers’ discoveries was that the bacterial composition of brain metastases varied depending on where they were located in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumors in the posterior region contained richer and more diverse bacterial populations than those closer to the front of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We assume that varying conditions in different parts of the brain, such as differences in blood supply or in the metabolic composition of the surrounding tissue, may account for this,” Straussman said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3687989" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/ravid.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3687989" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/ravid-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated whether bacteria could influence the efficacy of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By culturing 30 bacterial species found in glioblastoma tumors, the scientists found that some species made cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to fight these bacteria would be “unpredictable or even harmful,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is better to modulate these bacterial effects, rather than “ignoring them or eliminating them indiscriminately,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patients with fewer bacteria survived longer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that the survival time of patients with brain metastases was linked to the bacteria in their tumors. People with more bacteria in their brain tumors lived less than those with fewer bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain bacterial species may even render brain tumors resistant to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of treating brain metastases is not only due to their location in the brain — which can impair cognitive and physical functions — but also from their biological makeup, “which often renders them resistant to existing therapies,” said Shai of Rambam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study revealed that brain tumors contain diverse bacterial communities that can influence immune responses and inflammation,” she said. “These findings bring us one step closer to more effective diagnosis and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now researchers say internet searches for the anti-anxiety drug surged after the show’s release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lorazepam, also known by its brand name Ativan, is a type of drug known as a benzodiazepine, or “benzo”. It is thought to work by boosting the effect of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers in the US say the name-dropping of lorazepam on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-white-lotus" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt; has fuelled a rise in interest around the drug and how to access it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Olivia Maynard of the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study, described the data as striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That this TV show is causing people to explore purchasing benzodiazepines online is particularly concerning because there is a huge amount of illicit production of benzodiazepines, and these drugs are often dosed incorrectly and/or inconsistently and sometimes contain different drugs entirely,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Recently, some illicit ‘benzodiazepines’ which people have bought online have been found to contain nitazenes, a dangerous synthetic opioid, which could lead to overdose or even death if taken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego analysed data from Google, finding that, while searches for lorazepam were stable from January 2022 to the end of the first week of February 2025, they surged after the third season of The White Lotus was released on 16 February and remained at increased levels for the next 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, the team say there were almost twice as many searches relating to lorazepam over this 12-week period than would normally be expected, equating to about 1.6m additional searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was also an increase in the number of searches about how to get hold of lorazepam, with such queries about 64% higher than expected for the 12-week period – reflecting about 30,000 extra searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, no such spikes were seen for searches related to alprazolam or clonazepam – benzodiazepines not mentioned in The White Lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.4931" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt;, cannot unpick whether people were simply searching for information about lorazepam or buying the drug, the researchers say the results raise concerns given the rise in prescribing of such medications and the increase in illegitimate online pharmacies selling benzodiazepines without prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers also warn The White Lotus did not portray the risks of suddenly stopping lorazepam – noting this can cause panic attacks, agitation, and seizures – or convey the dangers of drinking alcohol while taking benzodiazepines. As the NHS website notes: “It can make you sleep very deeply. You may have breathing problems and difficulty waking up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers say the entertainment industry should develop ‘best practice’ approaches to how prescription medications are shown, adding the use of health information panels could sate curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at Liverpool John Moores University, said that, while signposting to further advice and support is sometimes included at the end of shows, there are other approaches to keeping viewers safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Whilst it could be useful if entertainment shows incorporated health advice where potentially harmful products are prominent, I don’t think this is realistic to expect from a creative point of view, and there is the risk that heavy-handed warnings can lead to counterproductive outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Where access to medicines is concerned, I think the greatest impacts will be seen through enforcement action against illicit manufacturers and unregulated providers, and prescriber education, as over-[prescribing] or inappropriate prescribing of clinically useful but potentially harmful medicines remains a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNc0NKQnBRZTQtejVsU3FTOXo0cFRYV0lPdGJIbWpKeVVVUWFTTjZyeWRVUE9TanVMeV9DY2xINktCOWNXU0xCRDZzYkxRemdjMjFmWWo0SGRIUDhiYVhqbV9HemVKZVBOcVN0azBmMENJZ0tTUVc1YlZPOFVOTVFqMDFzSzdWTmVYYlRrd0xxZnhjZE9xY0dqdTlOSGc0UlB5X1YtWERMc1FXMUNmR0E</guid></item><item><title>研究表明， “白莲花”引发了网上对高风险焦虑药的兴趣-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/14/white-lotus-benzodiazepines-lorazepam-interest/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="topper-text-elems" class="wpds-c-kebnqj wpds-c-kebnqj-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-topper" class="wpds-c-cBzrLX wpds-c-cBzrLX-cmVlgk-isCenterNS-false wpds-c-cBzrLX-iyHTpF-useUATStyles-true wpds-c-cBzrLX-ieuxqEo-css"&gt;&lt;h1 id="main-content" data-qa="headline" data-testid="headline" class="wpds-c-eRlesA wpds-c-eRlesA-dHdMuz-isOnSplitTopper-false wpds-c-eRlesA-bAbYzz-isStyle-false wpds-c-eRlesA-iPJLV-css"&gt;‘The White Lotus’ sparked online interest in risky anxiety pills, study says&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p data-qa="subheadline" data-testid="subheadline" class="wpds-c-ckOSsQ wpds-c-ckOSsQ-iPJLV-css"&gt;Google searches for lorazepam surged after anxiety pills played a significant role in Season 3 of “The White Lotus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-testid="timestamp" class="wpds-c-bEimne wpds-c-bEimne-dyECYW-theme-default"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2025-11-14T16:00:00.000Z" class="wpds-c-gRBhEF wpds-c-gRBhEF-idbzzBd-css overrideStyles"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-eUMOSL"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="published-date" class="wpds-c-bASIGw wpds-c-bASIGw-ilmVsQY-css overrideStyles"&gt;November 14, 2025 at 11:00 a.m. EST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="relative-date" class="wpds-c-bASIGw wpds-c-bASIGw-idUCtvg-css overrideStyles"&gt;25 minutes ago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:01:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQZGhxM3N4MWRrRHRodlhXOTJ3aC0wT1U4eGpjbW5Lci1sLW9mbVR0bGJsMTdTV1k0ektVazk5QU4zOVJoQVplN3A2LWtXcDFvcDNlMzRmeXFMYUhobmFnVkJGSVdwOHpzQkJFTDNwU1FMeEV3UG1mSERQMWNSSmNfcXJhV2pYa0cyclFOR0p2RE1udEI4cTcwLUtVTHQ</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说， “无声的流行病”将男性的健康置于严重的风险之中- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/expert-warns-silent-epidemic-puts-120004600.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gastroesophageal reflux disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gastroesophageal reflux disease&lt;/a&gt;

is becoming a "silent epidemic" among men — and what they can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn’t just about heartburn, but about systemic inflammation that starts in the gut and spreads throughout the body," Gioffre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;While gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects both men and women, men tend to experience more severe symptoms and complications.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Acid reflux is the body’s alarm system, warning that the gut, metabolism and stress response are all out of balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/mens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Men today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Men today&lt;/a&gt; are living in a "pressure cooker," Gioffre warned. "Chronic stress, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:poor sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt;, processed foods, alcohol and medication overuse are destroying gut health and digestion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Combine that with typical diets heavier in meat, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods, and a greater tendency to ignore symptoms, and you’re breeding a perfect storm for chronic inflammation and increased risk of reflux compared to women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/even-low-calorie-processed-food-causes-weight-gain-testosterone-loss-men-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Even Low-calorie Processed Food Causes Weight Gain, Testosterone Loss In Men, Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even Low-calorie Processed Food Causes Weight Gain, Testosterone Loss In Men, Study Suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late-night eating, larger portions, less fiber and high caffeine intake also stack the deck against men, he said. In addition to dietary choices, men’s lifestyle behaviors can also impact digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Late-night eating and larger portions are part of what make men more prone to acid reflux and other digestive issues.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many men skip meals, eat too quickly and rely on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:convenience foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;convenience foods&lt;/a&gt; stripped of minerals and fiber," Gioffre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this "ongoing acid assault" erodes the gut lining, drives acid upward and turns normal esophageal cells into precancerous Barrett’s cells, increasing cancer risk dramatically, he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ultraprocessed foods, Gioffre called out three specific components that worsen acid reflux: refined salt, sugar and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/cooking-oil-linked-colon-cancer-early-study-tied-inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seed oils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, they inflame the gut and weaken both digestion and the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps acid in the stomach where it belongs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men also tend to drink more coffee than women, often two to three cups a day, usually on an empty stomach, Gioffre pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That constant caffeine hit strips minerals, dehydrates the body and spikes acidity — all of which increase the risk of reflux."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/breakfast-timing-may-hold-key-living-longer-new-research-reveals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Breakfast Timing May Hold The Key To Living Longer, New Research Reveals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast Timing May Hold The Key To Living Longer, New Research Reveals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he said, "men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes. Otherwise, reflux will only keep getting worse and harder to treat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some biological differences between the genders that contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/mens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:men’s higher risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;men’s higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of severe gastrointestinal conditions, according to Gioffre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Men produce less protective mucus and saliva — the body’s natural defense system that buffers acid when it backflows into the esophagus. So when acid reflux strikes, it hits harder," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That acid burns and erodes tissue that was never designed to handle acid in the first place, setting the stage for inflammation, damage and long-term complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger men also tend to carry more visceral (abdominal) fat, Gioffre noted, which increases pressure in the stomach and forces acid up into the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/scientists-reveal-how-your-favorite-soda-could-quietly-mess-your-mood" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Reveal How Your Favorite Soda Could Quietly Mess With Your Mood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists Reveal How Your Favorite Soda Could Quietly Mess With Your Mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/womens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Estrogen in women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Estrogen in women&lt;/a&gt; appears to protect the esophagus by improving blood flow and mucosal repair, protection men have much less of," the doctor said. "Without lower levels than women, their tissue where reflux hits doesn’t recover as quickly from repeated acid exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gioffre recommends that men take the following simple steps to immediately begin lowering their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the biggest and most overlooked causes of acid reflux is eating &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:too close to bedtime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;too close to bedtime&lt;/a&gt;," Gioffre said. "When you lie down after a meal, gravity is no longer helping to keep acid in your stomach where it belongs, so it’s much easier for it to travel up the wrong way into your esophagus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reflux symptoms often get worse at night, the doctor noted — "and it’s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why reflux symptoms often get worse at night, he noted — "and it’s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gioffre said it’s best to stop eating three hours before bed, which gives the body time to fully digest, empty the stomach and drop acid levels before lying down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common triggers include garlic, onions, spicy foods, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits and carbonated water, according to Gioffre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Download The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Download The Fox News App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of these weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps stomach acid where it belongs," he said. "Once that muscle relaxes, acid flows upward, causing heartburn by inflaming and irritating the esophageal and throat lining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor also recommends adding back alkaline minerals, digestive enzymes and a high-quality probiotic.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Karolinska Institutet have discovered how mammalian cells prevent the gradual buildup of harmful mutations in mitochondrial DNA, the small but vital genome that powers every cell. The study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aea4660" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, explains how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintains its integrity despite its uniparental mode of inheritance and rapid mutation rate.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and undergoes recombination that can remove mutations, the mtDNA is passed down exclusively from the mother. This makes it vulnerable to the irreversible accumulation of mutations, a process that, over generations, could lead to a mutational meltdown and threaten species survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this fate, evolution has equipped cells with two protective mechanisms: a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+bottleneck/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic bottleneck&lt;/a&gt;, which is a stochastic process that transmits only a subset of all mtDNA copies present in the mother to her children, and purifying selection, which is an active process that weeds out mutated mtDNA molecules as the oocyte develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fewer mitochondrial DNA in the mother—lower mutation burden in the offspring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, scientists did not know if and how these two processes were connected or how purifying selection worked at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers discovered that when fewer mitochondrial DNA copies are passed from mother to offspring, there is more &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+variation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic variation&lt;/a&gt; between individuals and fewer harmful mutations are transmitted. In other words, a smaller genetic bottleneck allows purifying selection to work more effectively, removing defective mtDNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when the researchers disrupted the cell's ability to recycle damaged mitochondria by impairing autophagy, this protective filtering weakened: harmful &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mutations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mutations&lt;/a&gt; accumulated, and mtDNA quality declined.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that the size of the mitochondrial bottleneck determines how effectively mutated mitochondrial DNA can be removed during maternal transmission. This provides a mechanistic explanation for how mitochondrial inheritance remains stable over &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+time/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;evolutionary time&lt;/a&gt;," says Nils-Göran Larsson, Professor at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how cells preserve mitochondrial genome integrity is not only of evolutionary interest—it has major biomedical implications. Mutations in mtDNA are implicated in a wide range of diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By uncovering the link between mitochondrial turnover, bottleneck size, and selection, we now have a clearer view of how cells can maintain healthy mitochondria—and where this process might fail in disease," says Laura Kremer, first author and currently researcher at the University of Göttingen (formerly at Karolinska Institutet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings establish a framework for studying how mtDNA quality control could be enhanced therapeutically, offering new perspectives for conditions driven by mitochondrial genome instability.&lt;/p&gt;

The climate crisis, which is raising global temperatures and causing more ferocious rainfall, is aggravating around half of known human pathogenic diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01426-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists have determined&lt;/a&gt;, as disease-carrying mosquitoes expand their range across a rapidly heating world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The sharp increase in transmitted diseases in the Amazon region comes as UN climate talks take place in Belém, a Brazilian city that sits near the mouth of the Amazon river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health was, until a few years ago, a largely overlooked area of the climate crisis in these annual summits but the UN declared Thursday “health day” at Cop30 and promoted a new plan to help countries deal with the array of illnesses and life-threatening conditions spurred by a hotter world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Across the world, people are living the daily reality that the climate crisis is also a public health crisis,” said Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief. “Rising temperatures, floods, droughts, and storms are claiming lives, fueling diseases and malnutrition, and placing immense pressure on health systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="29678ce3-7714-45e5-b089-630587cee50c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Children wear masks for a vaccination campaign against whooping cough and yellow fever on 08 May 2025 in Quito, Ecuador. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Agencia Press South/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stiell said the new &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/climate-change/en---belem-action-plan.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Belém Health Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;, led by Brazil’s government and the World Health Organization, will help countries with surveillance, best practices and capacity building to help them deal with climate-fueled health issues. A coalition of 35 philanthropic bodies has pledged $300m in funding for the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Humanity can only win this global climate fight if we connect stronger climate actions to people’s top priorities in their daily lives,” Stiell said. “And there are few higher priorities than our health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But climate advocates and health experts say much more will need to be done to deal with the fallout from scorching temperatures and worsening disasters such as flooding. On Wednesday, Al Gore, the former US vice-president, said that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/29/rising-heat-kills-one-person-a-minute-worldwide-lancet-countdown" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent evidence &lt;/a&gt;that rising heat is killing one person a minute worldwide shows that governments are badly failing to curb the direct human harm of the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“How long are we going to stand by … keep turning the thermostat up so that these sort of events get even worse? Gore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health experts said that several factors are causing the expansion of infectious diseases, such as the razing of forests for agriculture and housing, which is bringing humans closer to animals that can spread zoonotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s globalization as well and it’s also the fact that mosquitoes are smart and so are bacteria,” said Maria Guevara, the international medical secretary of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, who is at the Belem gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“And whether it’s bacteria or viruses, they transmit, they’re just smarter than humans in that case because they’re more adapted, and they will adapt to survive. We are much too slow. We know what we need to do about climate change, but we’re not doing anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Guevara said much more will need to be done to equip countries that are having outbreaks of disease worsened by the extreme weather. MSF has in recent years had to respond to outbreaks of yellow fever in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the wake of severe droughts or floods. Distribution of vaccines can be difficult even in countries like Brazil, where yellow fever inoculations are free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’ve had huge outbreaks of dengue and an increase in yellow fever even outside of the Amazon region because of lots of rain and high temperatures, which makes the mosquitoes bite more and affects the reproduction of virus in the mosquitoes,” said Rachel Vicente, an &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r1796" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt; at the health sciences center at Brazil’s Federal University of Espírito Santo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People are living near more breeding sites, too, especially in urban areas of Brazil. It’s a perfect storm and it’s not just a problem of tropical areas any more, we’ve had outbreaks in Europe because it is getting warmer there and is becoming easier for the vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all need to collaborate more on resilience because all countries will need to prepare for this now, not just some of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOSlBweXhneHUtRi1neWdNTFdEYW9zdnk5ZlR2eGlPNlEyQUhzUWFfZXNxT1YtZVY5WWhZTHowRS1rYVVTdk5uUkJCNHlqdVJSX09nNGYyejZaZzNvUGRCUVRQMnI0Sk4wdG1JZHFGLUNhNnNnOU1pSURTMVFRUWFQRFRGRjZPRVRnN3NhVjVWcEVzRThiUGJCZw</guid></item><item><title>牙齿和牙龈中出现的8种健康问题：您的微笑揭示了您的健康状况-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/8-health-problems-that-show-up-in-your-teeth-and-gums-what-your-smile-reveals-about-your-wellness/articleshow/125282265.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your teeth and gums are more than tools for chewing; they can reveal what is happening inside your body. Dentists are often the first to spot hidden health issues because many illnesses show early signs in the mouth long before other symptoms appear. Changes such as enamel erosion, gum colour, tooth mobility, or even grinding patterns can act as subtle warning signals. These oral changes may point to nutritional deficiencies, hormonal shifts, digestive problems or even conditions affecting the heart, kidneys or bones. In some cases, dental signs are the first clue that something more serious needs medical attention. Your smile says it all. Paying attention to what your mouth is telling you not only protects your smile but also supports overall well-being. Here are eight surprising things your teeth and gums may reveal about your health. Take a look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8 hidden health problems your teeth and gums may reveal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Worn or thinning enamel may signal an eating disorder&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent enamel erosion, especially on the inside surfaces of the teeth, may indicate frequent exposure to stomach acid. This can happen in conditions involving self-induced vomiting, where stomach acid repeatedly reaches the mouth and gradually erodes enamel. As enamel wears away, teeth become thin, weak, sensitive and more prone to chipping. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6831-14-92?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the journal BMC Oral Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, people who engage in self-induced vomiting show significantly higher enamel erosion, particularly on the inner tooth surfaces, due to repeated stomach acid exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Essential dental tips for healthier teeth and gums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with restrictive eating patterns may also lack essential nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D, which are needed to maintain strong teeth. While tooth erosion alone cannot diagnose an eating disorder, it is often one of the earliest visible signs and may prompt a dentist to recommend medical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pale or whitish gums can indicate possible anaemia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy gums should look pink and firm. If gums appear unusually pale, whitish or almost translucent, it may indicate a lack of healthy red blood cells, a condition known as anaemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen, people can experience fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath. Anaemia caused by deficiencies such as iron, vitamin B12 or folate often shows subtle oral signs before other symptoms become noticeable. Although gum colour alone cannot confirm a diagnosis, it may encourage a dental professional to advise a blood test. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in iron, B12, and folate, along with regular dental check-ups, can help prevent anaemia and support overall oral and systemic health effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loose teeth or bone loss around teeth may be a sign of osteoporosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis weakens bones throughout the body, and the jawbone is no exception. The jawbone supports teeth, and when bone density decreases, teeth may become loose, gums may recede, and gaps may develop. Dentists may notice changes during routine X-rays, sometimes before fractures or other symptoms appear elsewhere in the body. Osteoporosis is more common as people age and in those with low calcium intake, hormonal changes or sedentary lifestyles. While tooth loss can have many causes, unexplained loosening of teeth may indicate reduced bone density and the need for further medical assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent gum inflammation may point to kidney disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidney disease affects the body’s ability to filter waste and can weaken the immune system. People with reduced kidney function often experience dry mouth, changes in taste and increased inflammation. This inflamed environment encourages bacteria to grow, increasing the risk of gum disease. Gum inflammation may cause bleeding, swelling and eventually tooth loss if untreated. Studies suggest a two-way relationship: gum disease may worsen kidney health by allowing bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Regular dental check-ups can help manage symptoms and reduce complications for those with kidney concerns. Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential, as brushing twice daily, flossing and using an antibacterial mouthwash can reduce harmful bacteria. Managing blood pressure, diabetes and hydration also supports both gum and kidney health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;White patches in the mouth may indicate oral thrush or immune issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;White, creamy patches on the tongue, inner cheeks or palate may indicate oral thrush, a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of candida. Thrush can develop when the immune system is suppressed, such as in individuals with diabetes, respiratory illnesses, long-term antibiotic use or compromised immunity. It may cause discomfort, burning sensations and difficulty swallowing. Because oral thrush can sometimes signal underlying immune changes, persistent symptoms should be assessed by a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tooth enamel erosion can be caused by acid reflux&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic acid reflux brings stomach acid into contact with the mouth, especially during night-time episodes. Frequent exposure dissolves the protective enamel layer, particularly on the back surfaces of teeth. Over time, teeth may become sensitive to hot or cold foods, change colour or develop small pits and notches. Severe erosion can alter the bite and make teeth more prone to cracking. Dentists can often spot the early signs during routine examinations, making it easier to identify reflux even before someone recognises digestive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Neglecting oral hygiene can signal cognitive decline&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decline in consistent oral hygiene, especially in individuals who previously maintained excellent dental care, may be an early sign of cognitive or memory decline. Forgetting routine brushing, skipping dental check-ups or allowing food debris to build up can signal difficulty with daily self-care. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10150074/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, adults with greater tooth loss had a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia, suggesting that oral health and brain health are closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Grinding teeth during sleep may be linked to sleep apnoea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaw clenching or grinding during sleep, known as bruxism, can indicate disrupted breathing patterns. Research suggests that a significant number of people with obstructive sleep apnoea also grind their teeth at night. Teeth may appear worn down, flattened or chipped, and people may wake with jaw pain or morning headaches. Sleep apnoea is a serious condition linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, so recognising grinding as a potential clue can lead to important early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwg992q005jmemby174a0le@published"&gt;About eight years ago, Grant decided he would never vaccinate his dogs again. A former Army medic, the Santa Barbara, California, resident had always given his pets whatever the veterinarian recommended, including shots for rabies and parvo. But after training as a bodyworker and practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine, he started to question the utility of the preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxh001h3b78mcr8slo8@published"&gt;Influenced by the tenets of TCM and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/books/experiments-in-deceit.html"&gt;a book he read&lt;/a&gt; on the unethical practices of rabies vaccine pioneer Louis Pasteur, Grant became skeptical that the collection of symptoms identified by veterinarians as &lt;em&gt;rabies&lt;/em&gt; was an actual, distinct disease that could be targeted by an injectable drug. Though he distrusts pharmaceutical products, potential adverse effects aren’t his major objection to the shots. “It’s more about not being convinced at all that there’s really anything to vaccinate &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001i3b78ezluwayf@published"&gt;Though health authorities adamantly agree that rabies is a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies"&gt;real virus&lt;/a&gt;, Grant is far from alone in his skepticism about vaccines. In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23010150"&gt;2023 survey&lt;/a&gt; of American dog owners published in the journal Vaccine, 30 percent deemed dog vaccines medically unnecessary, 22 percent called them ineffective, and 37 percent worried that they could cause autism in their pets. A small majority expressed at least one of these three positions, exhibiting what the researchers called a &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/nearly-half-of-dog-owners-are-hesitant-to-vaccinate-their-pets/"&gt;concerning degree&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001j3b78uf2enypr@published"&gt;Studies and anecdotal reports have documented vaccine skepticism among pet owners around the world for years. In 2017, a &lt;a href="https://www.brooklynpaper.com/not-a-shot-anti-vax-movement-prompts-brooklynites-to-withhold-inoculations-from-their-pets-vets-say/"&gt;Brooklyn Paper article&lt;/a&gt; declared that veterinarians in the New York borough were hearing clients express concerns about routine shots. According to &lt;a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/7420/2019-paw-report_downloadable.pdf"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from an animal welfare organization in the U.K., just 66 percent of cat, dog, and rabbit owners said in 2019 that their pet was vaccinated while young, compared to 84 percent in 2016. Veterinarians &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-03-01/vaccine-hesitancy"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine-hesitant pet owners have good intentions and only want their pets to be well; the American Veterinary Medical Association, which did not return a request for comment, has published &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/vaccine-hesitancy-gives-some-us-dog-cat-owners-cold-feet"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; for vets who must promote vaccination to skeptical clients.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001k3b78dszbvxbm@published"&gt;But opposition to pet vaccines seems to have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that since contemporary pet owners view their animal companions as family members, attitudes toward veterinary treatments &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2018/04/30/veterinarians-want-you-to-know-vaccines-will-not-give-your-dog-autism/"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; attitudes toward human medical interventions. The Vaccine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journal study found that people with negative views of human vaccines were likelier to have negative opinions of animal vaccines—and COVID-19 had a lasting impact on the way people feel about preventative shots. In a series of Gallup polls, the percentage of Americans who said it was extremely or very important for parents to vaccinate their children &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;dropped 15 points&lt;/a&gt; between 2020 and 2024, a decline the poll attributed almost entirely to right-leaning Americans. A survey conducted in Brazil found that pet owners were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016758772300257X"&gt;six times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to refrain from vaccinating their animals if they themselves were not fully vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001l3b78e173rzpt@published"&gt;Anti-vaccine advocates save their strongest rebukes for mRNA pet vaccines, the first of which were approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/blog/2024/06/25/usda-approval-nobivac-nxt-civ/"&gt;canine influenza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/blog/2024/09/24/usda-approval-nobivac-nxt-felv/"&gt;feline leukemia&lt;/a&gt; last year. The menu of veterinary mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.aaha.org/trends-magazine/publications/rna-vaccines-the-way-of-the-future/"&gt;may soon expand&lt;/a&gt;; in Canada, pets can already get one for rabies. Because the two most famous and effective COVID-19 vaccines—Pfizer’s and Moderna’s—were the first-ever mRNA products to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, mRNA technology has become a primary villain of the anti-vaccine movement in both human and animal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001m3b78e7u09p3r@published"&gt;Just as the alleged connection between human vaccines and autism has been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/"&gt;thoroughly, repeatedly debunked&lt;/a&gt;, there is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/world/europe/britain-dogs-autism-vaccine.html"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that pet vaccines are responsible for the ills with which anti-vaccine advocates credit them, from early-onset cancers to a suite of cognitive and behavioral problems that some half-jokingly call “pawtism.” Like autism in humans, “pawtism” is allegedly characterized by repetitive behaviors, sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and difficulty in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001n3b78350zjtqx@published"&gt;The lack of scientific backing for these vaccine concerns hasn’t stopped a multitude of influencers, care providers, and activists from raising alarm about veterinary shots. There are peddlers of tonics that claim to heal pets from the effects of “&lt;a href="https://shoprawdogfood.rawdogfoodandco.com/products/detox-bundle"&gt;toxic preventatives and pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;.” There are podcasters trumpeting “&lt;a href="https://angelaardolino.com/over-vaccination-with-dr-jeff-grognet/"&gt;the risks of over-vaccination&lt;/a&gt;.” There are social media personalities posting scary videos about pet vaccines “&lt;a href="https://x.com/ValerieAnne1970/status/1956627314965348531"&gt;shedding&lt;/a&gt;” onto humans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001o3b788imudhey@published"&gt;Among conventional veterinarians, there is no recognized diagnosis of animal autism. But some alternative practitioners insist that it is a real condition, sometimes caused by vaccines. Caroline Wilkinson, a dog trainer in the U.K., said she first learned about the possibility through the teachings of a holistic veterinarian. (Wilkinson is not a veterinarian.) She became convinced that it was a real phenomenon after seeing an increase in “fear-based behaviors” among puppies after their first shots, which she claims to have reversed with essential oil therapy. “It could be argued that these fear-based behaviors came as part of the developmental stages of puppyhood,” she said—but the speed with which the puppies recovered “indicates to me that the chemical load of the vaccine was responsible.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001p3b78gd3p9rv4@published"&gt;Many of the people and organizations decrying pet vaccines are the same ones fueling skepticism of human vaccines. Children’s Health Defense, a prominent anti-vaccine advocacy group founded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Miracles-Everywhere-Unorthodox-Veterinary/dp/1510782028?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; last year about “the dangers of over-vaccination” in veterinary medicine. &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1915450267170201852"&gt;A recent video&lt;/a&gt; posted by the organization featured holistic veterinarian &lt;a href="https://ahavet.com/"&gt;Judy Jasek&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed that the “toxicity” of vaccines is causing cancer in young pets. “We know they’re not testing this stuff,” she said in the video, calling the vaccine manufacturers “the same big pharmaceutical companies that are doing their shenanigans with people.” (While shots can, on &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/vaccines-and-sarcomas-concern-cat-owners"&gt;rare occasions&lt;/a&gt;, cause tumors at the injection site in cats, there is no evidence that vaccines are responsible for other types of pet cancers.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001q3b78ixlbah59@published"&gt;Jasek, who sees clients via telemedicine from her base in Tennessee, told me she started her career as a conventional veterinarian. About a decade into her practice, she began having doubts that the vaccines she delivered to animals were safe or necessary. Her suspicions were not based on any available medical literature. “Is there a formal, quote-unquote ‘research study’? No,” she said in an interview. “Nobody’s going to do research that shows that vaccines are toxic and bad, because there’s so much money made in the vaccine industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001r3b78wwsuinsh@published"&gt;Instead, Jasek drew her conclusions from her own observations and discussions with other “holistically-minded” colleagues. She decided to transition to a different kind of veterinary practice, replacing pharmaceutical products with herbs and homeopathic remedies. She counseled her clients on vaccinating their pets less, if at all. But “rabies is really hard to get around, because of the laws,” she said. The rabies vaccine is legally required for domestic canines in &lt;a href="https://www.animallaw.info/content/rabies-vaccination-and-exemption-laws-dogs"&gt;most U.S. states&lt;/a&gt;, including Colorado, where Jasek was practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001s3b789vdjdzq3@published"&gt;Like more than a dozen other states, Colorado offered a loophole for medical exemptions. If she could argue that a pet was not healthy in any way, Jasek would write up a note excusing the animal from the rabies vaccine. Most of the time it worked fine, but she says she was twice contacted by the state board because people had filed complaints against her. (The complaints never led to any disciplinary proceedings.) Once, it was another veterinarian who didn’t believe an exemption was justified. Another time, a client’s unvaccinated dog bit someone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001u3b78s6dxm8a0@published"&gt;Rabies outbreaks in wildlife populations are &lt;a href="https://beaconbio.org/en/report/?reportid=228441a4-540b-4c15-84ec-ec8df7c569cd&amp;amp;eventid=1a182de8-04e5-450c-8d66-5dc49010b31e"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; across the U.S., due in part to human incursion on natural habitats. Though the people who have died from rabies exposure in the last year have gotten the disease from wild animals, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rabies-outbreaks-rising-us-deaths-vaccine-rcna227771"&gt;veterinarians worry&lt;/a&gt; that distrust of pet vaccinations could lead to a resurgence among domestic animals of a virus that is nearly 100 percent fatal in both animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001v3b78v07jx8eg@published"&gt;People whose pets aren’t vaccinated for rabies may have difficulty finding a groomer or a place to board their dogs and cats, and they won’t be able to take international flights with their pets. Grant can’t license his dogs, as Santa Barbara regulations require, because one has never been vaccinated and the other hasn’t had one since his initial puppy shots. (For this reason, Grant requested a pseudonym as a condition of our interview.) “As a practitioner myself, boy, it would sure be nice if local and state and federal governments would force people by law to consume my product,” he said. Rabies vaccine mandates are “kind of the definition of fascism, where government and corporations have merged, and now it’s claimed that it’s science—it’s scientific, so therefore it’s public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxn001w3b78ounvny4o@published"&gt;Grant does not take his beloved dogs to a veterinarian. He handles their medical care himself, using natural products and bodywork techniques. Recently, hoping to rid Grant’s dog Pilgrim (also a pseudonym) of a flea problem, a family member gave Pilgrim a pharmaceutical flea medication. According to Grant, the drug knocked Pilgrim out for the better part of four days. Grant massaged the muscles around his vital organs, which seemed to help Pilgrim regain the ability to stand up and urinate. As for the fleas, Grant will stick to using natural shampoos and brushing Pilgrim more often, even if it’s a partial, temporary fix. And he’ll take his chances without vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

But is that actually scientific? Is it actually possible?” Grant said. “We have to accept, to an extent, that life isn’t &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;perfect.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Alexandria health officials are warning residents of the Rosemont area to stay cautious after a fox encountered a dog and a person in separate incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fox “came into contact” with other on Nov. 9; but it is unclear if either the dog or person was bit or hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging anyone that may have been exposed to the fox to contact them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, an exposure to a rabid fox means that a person or animal is either scratched or bitten by a fox,” Eve Elliott, spokesperson for the Alexandria Health Department, told WTOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department offered few other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott said the fox was “put down” and tested positive for rabies, a viral disease that’s spread through saliva due to a bite or scratch from an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dog’s owners and the person have been contacted by the health department, Elliott said, “and we’re taking any safe next steps to make sure that they don’t get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott said rabies is endemic to Virginia: “It’s not tremendously uncommon that we have these rabies exposures in Virginia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/alexandria/2025/08/fox-tests-positive-for-rabies-in-alexandria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a rabid fox came into contact with a cat&lt;/a&gt; in the Rosemont/Del Ray area of Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so, so important that you are keeping your dogs and cats up to date on their vaccines. That way, in case there is an exposure to a rabid animal, your dogs and your cats are safe,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies symptoms in animals can include sudden aggression, drooling or foaming at the mouth or an unsteady gait. Elliot reminded people not to feed or approach stray or wild animals and keep pets on leash when in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott said if you see animals who seem to have any of those symptoms, you should call animal control immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are worried that you or a family member may have been exposed to rabies, Elliott said you should contact your local health department.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3pyzb7001w26oz4vo59xk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfegob700023b6n0j205utw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfegob700043b6nrrnjwufl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhxwvtwr00003b6qop8n1dny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhxxc5fz00093b6qex3df5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3pznud00003b6n8uxk68kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhm86fwe00113b6nrykigm0w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800153b6nqzonah2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800133b6na7eu54c9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800143b6ny1qprdwz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800163b6np1jmo6b6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjb8dd00023b6qsuibg7ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhm6yj4100023b6n3969q4u6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800173b6njapt2xvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qac5v00063b6n73xxa5i9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001h3b6nis2ltt0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001i3b6ngvuqwv70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001j3b6n43x8fosz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001k3b6ngiz2o6p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001l3b6nxwjjk34v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001m3b6ny3typaii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001n3b6nhzpimao9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qbimm000j3b6n436cd5ji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjguc200043b6qp601qigc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001p3b6nc4sb2hyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmho929ev00023b6qecsf4qy2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001q3b6n3dxc8p5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nusbaum points to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190962225001264?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001s3b6nie54a9qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001t3b6nmpmufrmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001u3b6nhw6nnfvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3ri5800003b6n4z2afhst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3xvho00053b6n1ie1b1or@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3uwwl00033b6nkm2kqnau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw41f5v000b3b6nc0jdlvri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qj4id00243b6ni62w3cr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000b3b6n97pdu453@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfj30lc00003b6qj1yjwct0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjky3n00063b6qe9nfa7zm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000d3b6n6n4pezr9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000e3b6neore5j4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000f3b6n5fihs5ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth. In androgenetic alopecia, we’re looking at more long-term therapies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000g3b6n8nu9po42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjsg7v000c3b6q2zoxa01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000h3b6ni4qm1e4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physicians cannot diagnose people they have not treated, but STAT asked a leading neurologist to consider the question: Why might a 79-year-old man need an MRI scan of his brain?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons, each related to different types of brain disorders. Let’s begin by looking at the statistics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memory complaints are by far the most common reason that one would need a brain MRI. The &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association 2025 Facts and Figures report&lt;/a&gt; notes that 13.2% of individuals ages 75-84 years have Alzheimer’s dementia, with the percentage increasing with age: The percentage jumps to 33.4% of people 85 and older. Dementia means that an individual’s cognition — their thinking and memory — has declined to the point that it interferes with day-to-day function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before one’s thinking and memory have declined to the point that they interfere with function, cognition may still be impaired, leading to daily tasks requiring more effort and taking longer to complete. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment, and it can be detected when people undergo cognitive testing, which is generally performed by a neuropsychologist. Its &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1136393-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; is 14.8% in those ages 75-79, and 25.2% in those aged 80-84. Adding the mild cognitive impairment prevalence (14.8%) to that of the dementia prevalence for 75- to 84-year-olds (13.2%), we have a prevalence of 28% for a 79-year-old to have either mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s dementia. Thus, more than one-quarter of 79-year-olds have cognitive impairment, which would lead them to get a brain MRI as part of their workup. Alzheimer’s can be diagnosed with increased certainty if a blood, spinal fluid, or amyloid PET scan biomarker is positive.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage include mild memory problems such as needing reminders, overly relying on GPS/phone apps to navigate even in familiar environments, misplacing and losing things more than before, word-finding difficulties, and trouble performing complicated tasks such as learning how to use a new software package, website, phone app, or board game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the cause of mild cognitive impairment and dementia approximately 60% of the time in people over the age of 75. But there are many other causes of dementia as well. Two disorders often mimic Alzheimer’s disease. Both have nice acronyms due to their long names. PART (primary age-related tauopathy) occurs in just about everyone who lives into their 80s or beyond. PART is believed to be one of the causes of “age-related” memory loss in individuals who do not have dementia, and so it is a large cause of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LATE (limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy) is common cause of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in people over the age of 75. Although many people haven’t heard of LATE, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6536849/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autopsy studies&lt;/a&gt; it is generally the third most common pathology observed in the brain, after Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cerebrovascular disease — also known as strokes — these are incredibly common and become more common as individuals age, such that the risk of stroke roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5321635/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; every decade after age 55. So, an individual aged 79 has more than five times the risk of stroke as someone who is 55 years old. Risk factors for strokes in addition to age include heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnea, kidney disease, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet (particularly with ultra-processed foods), and excessive alcohol. Most 79-year-olds have at least some tiny “mini-strokes” that are observable on an MRI scan. If one has many of these mini-strokes, they can cause mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Strokes can be seen on an MRI scan, which is the imaging study of choice to make the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of vascular mild cognitive impairment are similar to but not the same as those seen in Alzheimer’s disease, and include difficulty in or taking longer to do tasks, such as keeping information “in one’s head”; doing mental arithmetic like calculating the tip in a restaurant; following a route in one’s mind; figuring out how to use a software package, website, phone app, or board game; and finding words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last common cause of dementia is due to Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies, which are small clumps of protein inside brain cells that damage and then destroy them, are known for causing Parkinson’s disease, but they can cause mild cognitive impairment and dementia as well. When Parkinson’s disease starts first, we generally use the terms “Parkinson’s disease mild cognitive impairment” and “Parkinson’s disease dementia.” If the cognitive disorder starts first, we use the terms “mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies” and “dementia with Lewy bodies.” The core features of these disorders include cognitive impairment, signs of Parkinsonism, fluctuations in attention and alertness, acting out dreams while sleeping, and hallucinations (usually visual). Note that people don’t need to have all these symptoms to be diagnosed with a Lewy body disease. There are now spinal fluid and skin biopsy tests to diagnosis Lewy body diseases.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are other reasons besides strokes and memory problems that a 79-year-old man might need an MRI scan. These include collections of fluid that can accumulate in between the brain and the skull, such as a subdural hematoma. Falls, especially if they include hitting one’s head, can cause subdural hematomas and other types of brain bleeding. Other reasons to get a brain MRI are persistent dizziness or trouble walking, either of which can lead to a fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An MRI is also needed if one has a seizure, which occurs in approximate a dozen people out of every thousand who are age 79. Sometimes a headache is bad enough or persistent enough or unusual enough that one should get an MRI scan to rule out a brain bleed or brain tumor. Lastly, if someone has hearing loss in one ear it could also be due to a brain tumor, so that’s another reason to get an MRI scan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, there are many reasons why a 79-year-old man might need to get an MRI scan. Some reasons are relatively benign, such as a headache or hearing loss, and others are more worrisome, such as signs of stroke or memory loss. Many would require ongoing monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

He shared: “Do you take melatonin at night? &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The American Heart Association reviewed data from over 130,000 adults and found that long-term melatonin users (1+ year) had a 90 percent higher risk of heart failure within five years.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Now you might be thinking: 'Wait… isn’t melatonin natural?'

Taking melatonin nightly (especially long-term) can: disrupt your circadian rhythm, alter natural hormone signaling, reduce your body’s ability to produce its own melatonin.

The new recommendations provide a critical roadmap to tackle this growing health challenge and prevent serious complications for both women and their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes in pregnancy, if not managed effectively, significantly increases the risk of life-threatening conditions such as pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and birth injuries. It also has long-term consequences, elevating the lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases for both mother and child. The burden is greatest in low- and middle-income countries, where access to specialized care and resources may be limited, yet the need is most acute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHO has long had guidance on diabetes and guidance on pregnancy, but this is the first time we have issued a specific standard of care for managing diabetes during pregnancy,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These guidelines are grounded in the realities of women’s lives and health needs, and provide clear, evidence-based strategies to deliver high-quality care for every woman, everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines include 27 key recommendations, emphasizing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individualized care:&lt;/strong&gt; Advice on diet, physical activity, and blood sugar targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimal monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt;  All women with diabetes should have their blood glucose      checked regularly, both during clinic visits and at home. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized  treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Specific medication      regimens for type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes when pharmacotherapy      is required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized support:&lt;/strong&gt; Multidisciplinary care for women with pre-existing      diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of these guidelines marks a pivotal step in strengthening maternal health and combating noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). They underscore the importance of integrating diabetes care into routine antenatal services and ensuring equitable access to essential medicines and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guideline is launched on &lt;a href="/campaigns/world-diabetes-day/2025"&gt;World diabetes day 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the theme of this year, "Diabetes across life stages,” recognizes that every person living with diabetes should have access to integrated care, supportive environments and policies that promote health, dignity and self-management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is one of the fastest-growing health challenges of our time, affecting over 800 million people globally. It is a leading cause of heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower-limb amputation, and its impact stretches across generations and health systems. Over the last decades, the prevalence has been rising the most in low- and middle-income countries, where access to care and essential medicines remains limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on diabetes across life stages, this year’s campaign calls for urgent action to ensure that no one is left behind – from children and adolescents to older adults – and emphasizes the importance of a life-course approach to diabetes prevention, management and overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For 2025, the theme centres on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://worlddiabetesday.org/"&gt;“World Diabetes Day 2025: Diabetes and the workplace”,&lt;/a&gt; underlining the importance of health and well-being across all stages of life, including the professional sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, while many of us know the classic symptoms of diabetes, such as excess thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss, some signs are more subtle, especially in women. But what about the lesser-known symptoms that often go unnoticed until complications have already taken hold?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, especially on World Diabetes Day, it is vital that women understand these hidden alarms — symptoms that may seem benign or be dismissed as stress, ageing, or hormonal fluctuation but could signal the beginnings of Type 2 Diabetes (or worsened control). Because women have unique risks (such as pregnancy, hormonal shifts, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or PCOS, and vascular changes), it’s crucial to recognise lesser-known symptoms that often get brushed off as “just fatigue” or “just stress”. For many women, these hidden signals may mean early warning of type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes before more serious complications set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do these signs need extra attention? Because, early recognition can pave the way for timely screening, lifestyle adjustments, and better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 09:02:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家开发出可以在血液中游动对抗中风的微型机器人- SWI瑞士资讯swissinfo.ch</title><link>https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/healthcare-innovation/scientists-develop-tiny-robots-that-can-swim-through-your-blood-to-fight-strokes/90332305</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-main content-area container-column-grid-aware container-vertical-flow-aware"&gt;

        Researchers at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich have created a microrobot to fight diseases inside the body. Scientists can control the device, which is less than two millimetres in width, through blood vessels to deliver essential drugs.    &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tiny robot has not yet been tested on humans. However, it worked in tests on pigs and a sheep, the researchers reported on Thursday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="swiss-c5b73d27b93a27c9fe6bb0bc7e060ae9 swiss-content-ticker-middle" id="swiss-c5b73d27b93a27c9fe6bb0bc7e060ae9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical research has been trying for some time to develop methods to deliver drugs exactly where they are needed, ETH Zurich said in a press release. Today, many diseases, such as strokes or tumours, require high doses of drugs to be administered and distributed throughout the body, and this increases the risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                Swiss scientists have developed tiny elastic robots that can change shape depending on their surroundings.            &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new robot is designed to solve this problem. It consists of a spherical gel capsule in which medication can be embedded. The researchers have equipped this capsule with iron oxide nanoparticles that can be controlled from the outside using magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-releases-drug"&gt;Heat releases drug&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to ETH Zurich, the researchers combined three different magnetic navigation strategies with which they can navigate the robot in all regions of head arteries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible how much blood is pumped through our vessels and at what speed. Our navigation system has to be able to withstand all of this,” Fabian Landers, ETH Zurich researcher and main author of the study, said in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the destination, the capsule is then heated by a high-frequency magnetic field, causing the gel structure to dissolve and release the medication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enable doctors to follow how the capsule moves, the researchers have also equipped it with a contrast agent. They used tantalum nanoparticles, which are frequently used in medicine, but are more difficult to control because they are heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

Glucose is the main source of energy for cells, and its uptake depends on insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. When insulin production is insufficient or the body cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels. Persistently elevated blood sugar can damage vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves, causing serious long-term complications. According to the World Health Organisation, millions of people worldwide live with diabetes, and its prevalence continues to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the types, causes, and risks of diabetes is crucial for effective prevention and management, empowering individuals to make lifestyle choices that reduce complications and support overall long term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the two main types of diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is primarily classified into two main types: Type 1 and Type 2. Both types affect blood sugar regulation but have different causes, onset, progression, and management strategies, as well as varying impacts on long-term health, complications, and daily lifestyle requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in little or no insulin production. It often develops in childhood or adolescence but can also appear in adults. People with Type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Symptoms typically appear suddenly and include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;is far more common and usually develops later in life. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or cannot produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Risk factors include being overweight, physical inactivity, older age, family history, and certain ethnic backgrounds. Symptoms often develop gradually, which may delay diagnosis. Left unmanaged, Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, vision impairment, and nerve problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 1 vs Type 2 diabetes: Which is more risky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes carry serious health risks, but the nature and timing of these risks differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;can cause immediate and life-threatening complications if insulin therapy is missed. One of the most critical short-term risks is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a condition where the body starts breaking down fats for energy, producing toxic ketones that can be fatal if untreated. Managing Type 1 diabetes requires careful daily insulin administration, blood sugar monitoring, and attention to diet and physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;develops more gradually, and the risks accumulate silently over time. Chronic high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nerves, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks, kidney disease, vision loss, and neuropathy. Early lifestyle interventions such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight are essential to delay or prevent Type 2 diabetes progression. Medications and insulin may also be required if lifestyle changes alone are insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: Prevention and risk reduction tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 Diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper management with insulin therapy is essential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular monitoring of blood sugar helps maintain control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy eating and consistent physical activity support overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular medical check-ups detect complications early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 Diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a healthy body weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage in regular physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow a balanced and nutritious diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid tobacco use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor blood sugar levels regularly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screen for prediabetes and intervene early to prevent progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood pressure and cholesterol to reduce risk of complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;General management for both types:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adhere to prescribed medications and insulin therapy if needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritise lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and stress management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek education and professional support for effective disease management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consistency in daily routines ensures better glycaemic control and long-term health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is based on publicly available health information.

For 2025, the theme centres on “Diabetes across life stages” — meaning that from childhood to older age, every person has the opportunity to act to reduce risk, improve care and safeguard well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful ways to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes is by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/facts-about-sugar-and-sugar-substitutes"&gt;lowering added sugar intake&lt;/a&gt;. High sugar consumption contributes to weight gain, insulin resistance, and metabolic stress — key pathways to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11233937/"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those in sugary drinks, desserts, and processed snacks, raise blood glucose levels rapidly, promote weight gain, and worsen insulin resistance. But by choosing sweeteners that are more natural, less refined, and lower in glycaemic load, you can ease the metabolic burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is: you don’t have to give up sweet tastes entirely — you just have to embrace better and healthier alternatives. This World Diabetes Day, we explore seven natural alternative sweeteners that can help replace refined sugar — offering better blood-sugar support, lower glycaemic impact, and a more diabetes-friendly approach to sweetness. Let’s dive into how to skip the sugar — and sweeten more healthily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 05:20:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
