  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksealum000a3b7bywgye87z@published"&gt;My friend, “Angela”, who is in her 30s, is the first of my friends to have a baby. Her circle is small, and so is her fiancé’s. He is new to the state. They decided to try for a baby after just six months of dating, and will be wed this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksealwz000b3b7bwo2w5sxf@published"&gt;Angela is a hippie, and a victim of abuse at the hands of her father, brother, and past partners. One partner in particular was conspiratorial, and as a result, she has never received a COVID vaccine. In 2022, I was unable to see her before my abortion in the case that I might need surgery—I couldn’t risk contracting COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksealz6000c3b7blcr322gu@published"&gt;During her pregnancy, we talked about vaccination, and Angela told our friend group she intended on getting the baby vaccinated. She also told us she would get the Tdap shot during her pregnancy, though she never confirmed actually having done so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkseam1g000d3b7bgapsqsxl@published"&gt;Angela is now a stay-at-home mom with a four-month-old baby. I love this baby. I love the title of “auntie.” But Angela is becoming overprotective and delusional. She has no media literacy and is sharing anti-vaccine posts on Facebook. When challenged, she thanks me for my help, but it rings hollow. She talks often about “hating Trump,” but is now parroting a lot of his ideals. I can’t be friends with someone who doesn’t vaccinate their baby! How can I get through to her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="1" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkseam68000f3b7bvzjsk7cd@published"&gt;—Vaccinated&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksecyl2000p3b7bwu8lwwt8@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Vaccinated,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksed31r000u3b7be07orskk@published"&gt;Few things going on here! But the most glaring is that your friend’s baby is &lt;em&gt;four months old, &lt;/em&gt;meaning your friend is just &lt;em&gt;four-months postpartum. &lt;/em&gt;This is a hard, hard time for her—she’s isolated, she’s sleep deprived, her body and hormones are still doing strange things, and she’s got this living creature to take care of. You call her “overprotective and delusional,” but another way to put that might be “suffering from postpartum depression.” (Not a doctor! Just musing here, but like, c’mon.)&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkskwx3q003p3b7bliufjnyr@published"&gt;Right now, the best thing you could do for your friend would be to encourage her to speak to her doctor about how she’s feeling. And the next best thing would be to just be there for her, listen to her, be compassionate, and supportive, and yes, offer one IRL data point of dissent on the vax front (e.g., when she brings it up or posts about it, simply reply: “I’ve read the same stuff you have. And I still believe vaccinations save lives,” or whatever).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksg8olw003g3b7bm4qyhb60@published"&gt;As for “getting through to her” beyond that—good luck. We live in an information hellhole right now. Her media illiteracy and vax hesitancy is the result of societal failure, not her own personal or moral shortcoming. Her baby’s pediatrician will have many opportunities, and some authority, to talk her about vaccines. And there will (likely, probably, definitely, depending on where you live) be many checks in the future that could spur vaccination: daycare registration, school registration, camp registration. This isn’t your problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksl0frn003t3b7b3smdcrrm@published"&gt;But if this is a red line for you, then sure, tell her that and peace out. It sounds like you might be looking for a reason to do that anyway—judgment for your pal is just oozing from your letter, before you even mention vaccines. Your friend could definitely use a friend, but it doesn’t have to be you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkseajw4002ecvkkc88h50gq@published"&gt;I’m a personal assistant to a highly accomplished woman a few years older than me whom I admire and respect a great deal. I’ve worked with her for five years, and we have a close professional relationship. This weekend, we were together late one night when she confided in me how lonely she was; the long hours we work make it difficult for her to maintain a relationship, and she has few friends nearby. Then she told me how good it was to have someone she could confide in and how grateful she was that she could speak to me in confidence. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/01/dear-prudence-im-falling-in-love-with-my-boss.html"&gt;She gave me a look that under any other circumstance I would have taken as an invitation to kiss her. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleobt00173b7cu526hkp1@published"&gt;My husband and I went over to his parents’ for the Christmas holiday. His mother has never been particularly respectful of boundaries, but we thought we were safe to go at it at nearly 3 a.m. There’s no way she’d be up, then, right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksllz6c00233b7c4l8qdomg@published"&gt;My MIL decided there was something she just HAD to ask us that couldn’t wait until the next day, and she walked in on us. Things were rather awkward in the morning, but I thought it was just one of those dumb things and that would be the end of it. Instead it’s been the end of our sex life, namely the fact that my husband hasn’t been able to get it up since the incident. I’ve tried everything—pussy shaving, sexy lingerie, sucking his dick—nothing works. Both of us are extremely worried and don’t know what to do. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="6" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleoit00193b7clrxkepxb@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Trying to Raise the Dead,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleoly001a3b7ciz8qjcqf@published"&gt;Please relax. Not a lot of time has passed, and you’ve pinpointed a cause for the E.D. Plenty of people with non-working dicks and their partners write into this column having no idea why it’s happening. You at least have a leg up. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;dick up t&lt;/em&gt;hat you desire, but it’s something.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleop4001b3b7ckpe56478@published"&gt;Here’s what I would try: Work on eliminating the intrusive thoughts of this incident. This could be accomplished via therapy and/or a meditation practice. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/wife-secret-sex-toy-advice-tracking.html"&gt;I went into my practice in a previous column&lt;/a&gt;, so visit that page for tips. I have found that building the meditation muscle gives me the ability to pick and choose what my mind focuses on. It’s not 100 percent (I have not completely eliminated being haunted by disturbing thoughts or images) but I am doing much better than I did before, and I didn’t even know it was possible to not think about things that were bothering me. Your impulse to do whatever you can to help the matter is heartening and logical, but this issue may be above your pay grade. This is especially so if the root of the cause is, as it seems to be, that he feels “caught,” ashamed, like his boundaries were crossed, or like he’s somehow now associating sex with his mom. This is where working with a therapist/coach could really help. Couples counseling could be an option, but this may be something he mostly handles on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleotl001c3b7curxc3zf7@published"&gt;I would also get your husband some kind of wood-boosting assistance. Physiologically, he may not really need a PDE5 inhibitor like Viagra and/or a cock ring, but just having them can allay the anxiety that comes with and further exacerbates erectile dysfunction. Boner pills tend to be well-tolerated, and while some guys experience side effects (to the point of making the drugs off-putting), I think trying them is worth the small risk here—just to get him over the hump.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmksleoxs001d3b7c4suc4f9y@published"&gt;Also, try focusing on sex that doesn’t require his penis to be hard. Maybe that means he focuses on you orally/manually or that you introduce toys. Play in that space for a bit. Allowing him to get comfortable with this kind of contact may take the edge off and he may find himself able to perform. Again, this boner-killing event was fairly recent so giving it some time is also likely going to be useful. Patience!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not really my thing, but I agreed to give it a shot because I really like him. We’ve had our ups and downs, but our biggest hangup is that he doesn’t want to give me “veto” power over who he sleeps with. That hasn’t been a problem, really—until now. Recently, he told me he’s very attracted to my friend, and wants to hook up with her. I, um, hate this. For some reason, it’s making me super jealous, but I agreed to a relationship structure where he gets to do what he wants. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/boyfriend-relationship-rules-friend-sex-advice.html"&gt;What should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is insufficient scientific evidence that daily omega-3 supplementation lowers blood sugar (glucose) levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An elevated blood sugar level is a hallmark feature of diabetes, a lifelong condition that is typically managed with a combination of medication, nutrition therapy, and physical activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are considering taking an omega-3 supplement, speak with your healthcare provider first to avoid medication interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 supplements, also called fish oil supplements, contain a type of fat found in shellfish and cold-water fish like salmon, mackerel, and tuna.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Results from scientific studies on whether taking a daily omega-3 supplement impacts blood sugar (glucose) levels are mixed, with emerging evidence leaning towards minimal to no effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Elevated blood sugar levels due to defects in insulin production or action are characteristic of diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Without careful management, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/type-2-diabetes-complications-5120942" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes can lead to serious complications&lt;/a&gt; involving the eyes, kidneys, heart, and nerves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Due to the seriousness and chronicity of diabetes, scientists have launched an extensive and ongoing investigation into the potential role of supplements, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-omega-3-11772277" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, in both preventing diabetes and serving as an adjunct to traditional diabetes medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Despite substantial scientific investigation, results regarding the effect of omega-3 supplementation on blood sugar levels have been inconsistent.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, while some studies have found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-choose-omega-3-supplement-11845012" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 supplementation&lt;/a&gt; lowers blood sugar levels, others have reported little to no impact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-do-the-scientific-studies-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Do the Scientific Studies Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One example of a study reporting conflicting results on the impact of omega-3 on blood sugar is a 2024 study in &lt;em&gt;Current Nutrition Reports. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Basics of the study include the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This study&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reviewed 30 randomized controlled trials involving participants, primarily adults, with one of three forms of diabetes: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/type-2-diabetes-7371634" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/type-1-diabetes-7971457" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/glucose-tests-in-pregnancy-5115077" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants received omega-3 supplements of varying types and doses for six weeks to 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trial found that some participants experienced a reduction in fasting blood glucose levels with omega-3 supplementation, whereas others showed no change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Investigators noted that such differences in trial results could be attributable to factors like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Number of participants in each trial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trial duration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants' age and, specifically, how long they have had diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dosage of the omega-3 supplement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other examples of studies addressing the uncertain role of daily omega-3 supplementation on blood sugar levels include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;A 2022 study reviewed 30 randomized controlled trials involving participants with and without diabetes&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Results revealed that omega-3 supplementation led to a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar levels. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 2020 study reviewed 12 randomized controlled trials involving just over 800 adults with type 2 diabetes. &lt;strong&gt;Results revealed that&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;omega-3 supplementation did not affect blood sugar levels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 2019 study reviewed 83 randomized controlled trials involving more than 120,000 individuals with and without diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The average trial period lasted nearly three years. &lt;strong&gt;Results revealed that increasing omega-3 intake, whether through supplements or foods (fish or plants), had minimal to no effect on blood glucose levels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-i-take-an-omega-3-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Should I Take an Omega-3 Supplement? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that omega-3 supplements can improve blood glucose control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Diabetes Association (ADA) does not universally recommend omega-3 supplementation for individuals with diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 supplementation is also not formally recommended for individuals with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/pre-diabetes-4014095" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prediabetes&lt;/a&gt;, a common health condition marked by high blood sugar levels that are not yet elevated enough to fulfill a diagnosis of diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All said, there is some evidence, albeit mixed, that omega-3 supplements may improve cardiovascular health in individuals with diabetes and risk factors for heart disease, like high cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Given this potential link, your healthcare provider may recommend omega-3 supplements based on your personal heart disease risk factors.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always consult your healthcare provider before starting an omega-3 supplement to ensure it's safe and appropriate for your care. Omega-3 supplements may interact with certain medications, like blood thinners.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your provider recommends an omega-3 supplement, side effects are generally mild, with common ones being:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those with prediabetes or diabetes, the ADA recommends adopting a healthy eating pattern to optimize blood sugar control and prevent diabetes-related complications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While no single diet suits everyone, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-8709362" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is a good fit for many.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is nonrestrictive, offers tasty choices, and has been found to reduce blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1pxwu004e26p2h8rc0rym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Go ahead, eat chocolate cake every day. One healthy cookbook author gives us permission — and a recipe that’s protein-packed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c0006356p1iwz1hx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rachel Riggs’ signature unfussy cake asks for just one bowl, a single whisk and 10 minutes to get the oven ready. The result is a chocolate dessert that contains 18 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/how-to-eat-more-protein-diet-wellness"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; per slice and tastes so amazing that Riggs ate a piece as part of lunch daily for six years straight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c0007356pn407f9a7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No wonder she named it The Everyday Chocolate Cake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c0008356pngjnttr2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a legit dessert. I think it’s virtually indistinguishable from any mainstream chocolate cake,” said Riggs, who included it in her debut cookbook, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Health-Uncomplicated-Allergen-Aware-Nourished/dp/1773272780" target="_blank"&gt;In Good Health&lt;/a&gt;: Uncomplicated, Allergen-Aware Recipes for a Nourished Life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c0009356p4h09y2d3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In this cake, the almond flour provides healthy fats, and the pure maple syrup, cocoa powder and unsweetened chocolate deliver antioxidants. Eggs are nutrition powerhouses, too,” Riggs explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000a356pz4e1uhav@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each serving of this cake has as much &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938420304376" target="_blank"&gt;appetite-taming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/1/66/5936522" target="_blank"&gt;muscle-building&lt;/a&gt; protein as three large eggs, which is courtesy of the almond flour, eggs and cocoa powder. (The cocoa powder alone adds about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169593/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;4 grams per ¼ cup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Each egg tacks on 6 grams, and each cup of almond flour layers on 32 grams more protein.) Keep in mind that it also has 39 grams of sugar per slice (including the ganache), courtesy of the natural sweetener maple syrup, so you can determine how often you’d like to slot this into your diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000b356p56d96yat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The inspiration for this cake came from a not-so-sweet place. Riggs has been passionate about food for as long as she can remember.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000c356pyqexetzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cheese is where my deepest passion was, so I opened a specialty food shop in 2006. Within four years, there was a substantial shift in my health, so I was forced to close my shop,” the author recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000d356pp0u6wsdf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The symptoms started off subtly but grew over time to the point that the profound fatigue they triggered resulted in “punishing payback for hours, days — or sometimes weeks,” she said. “Like so many people with chronic illness, I went from doctor to doctor, then started broadening my scope and traveling for medical care. It remained a mystery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000e356png00a6nx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During her mission to try anything that might ease the pain and fatigue, Riggs embarked on a doctor-approved, strict elimination diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000f356pit343apj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I went three months without this whole swath of ingredients,” Riggs said. “Eventually, I was able to start adding those things in, and that’s how you identify if something isn’t a good fit for your body.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000g356p8swkc1o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Riggs  discovered she felt better eliminating her original potential triggers, including  grains (not just gluten), dairy, refined sugars, legumes, peanuts, shellfish  and nightshades (a class of vegetables that includes tomatoes, potatoes,  peppers and eggplants). She still finds plenty  of different   foods to   eat, such   as meat, fish, seafood, fruits, many nuts, most vegetables, seeds,  herbs and spices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000h356psee1lqwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looking to cook with a limited ingredient   list, Riggs found inspiring options lacking and started  developing  her own recipes “to feed myself and my husband food that didn’t  feel punitive,” Riggs said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000i356px9b8y2a0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The result was her first cookbook, “In Good Health.” When pulling together those recipes, the nonnegotiables, she decided, were nourishment, deliciousness and ease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000j356p19t1onch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There aren’t any adaptations or faux foods here,” Riggs said. Instead, “it’s really just whole, nutrient-dense food. These are the recipes that I’ve been relying on for years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000k356pd3x28q76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes,  berries, sweet potatoes and salmon are on the menu. As is ahi tuna, roasted  almonds, rotisserie chicken and more. “Even if somebody doesn’t have their own restrictions, we’re all cooking for people that do these days,” she said. “This book is a great resource for when you’re cooking for friends or relatives who have dietary restrictions, say, for a holiday, which can be very daunting.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1c000l356prdh44wnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Start with The Everyday Chocolate Cake&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and   soon you’ll be trying Morning Glory Muffins,  Zesty Herbed Tahini Dip and Savory French Onion Beef.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            One of Riggs’ most beloved cures  for her cravings is this cake, which gets its decadent crumb from the cocoa powder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1d000s356pqv19y67i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She uses a premium cocoa powder with a higher fat content that gives it a richer flavor. “When you’re cooking with so few ingredients, the ingredients matter,” Riggs said. (That’s why she includes her product picks in the cookbook.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1d000t356p25uauhtc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once you’ve mastered this version of The Everyday Chocolate Cake, Riggs gives you permission to mix things up. Try adding ⅛ teaspoon of mint extract to the ganache for a minty chocolate cookie vibe, she said, or add a drop or two of orange oil instead. Or bake the same batter in a cupcake pan for a single-serving dessert.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkh1rs1d000u356pfo4iwkd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My book also includes a birthday cake variation on this with a thicker, more spreadable ganache, because nobody should have to celebrate a birthday without a birthday cake,” Riggs told me.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            Make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Thoroughly grease a 9-inch (23-centimeter) nonstick springform pan with coconut oil and line the bottom with parchment paper.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            In      a medium mixing bowl, whisk together almond flour, cocoa       powder, baking soda and salt, breaking up any      lumps. Add the maple syrup and eggs,      and whisk until smooth and combined well. Pour the batter into the springform pan. Using a rubber      spatula, spread it toward the edges and tap the pan on the counter to      level the batter.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            Bake for 25 minutes on the center rack. Cool for 20 minutes, then transfer the cake to a serving plate.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

            Allow      the cake to cool completely before making the ganache.

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            Make the ganache: Combine all ganache ingredients in a small glass or porcelain      bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Using a small whisk, whisk gently for 2      to 3 minutes, until the chocolate is melted, smooth, glossy and slightly      thickened but still pourable.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            Pour the chocolate ganache onto the top (center) of the cake. Using an offset spatula or the back of a spoon, carefully spread the ganache over the cake, nudging it gently over the edge and allowing it to drip down the sides as much as you like.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.6.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            Refrigerate the cake, uncovered, for 30 minutes so the ganache can set.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.7.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            Cover      and store at room temperature for up to three days, or in the fridge for up to a week.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

Symptoms of low vitamin D can be vague or even hard to detect at all, but these are commonly linked to the status, according to Jessica Cording, R.D., C.D.N., author of &lt;em data-node-id="17.1"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="18" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="18.1"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="18.3"&gt;Brain fog&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="18.5"&gt;Low mood&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="18.7"&gt;Getting sick a lot&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="18.9"&gt;Bone fractures (usually only in      severe cases)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-more-vitamin-d" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;How to get more vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Exposure to the sun is the most common way people get vitamin D, but it’s also possible to get the nutrient from foods. These are the biggest vitamin D sources, per the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h4" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h4" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NIH" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="21" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.0"&gt;     Cod liver oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.1"&gt;     Trout&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.2"&gt;     Salmon,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.3"&gt;     Mushrooms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.4"&gt;     Fortified milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.5"&gt;     Fortified cereal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But you can also get vitamin D from a supplement, Dr. Russo points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="should-you-take-a-vitamin-d-supplement-for-immune-health" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Should you take a vitamin D supplement for immune health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It depends. It’s always important to check with a healthcare provider before taking any kind of supplement, Dr. Schaffner says. In the case of vitamin D, your doctor will likely recommend that you get a blood test to measure your vitamin D levels to see if you have a deficiency, Dr. Adalja says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Why is this important? Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it can build up in your body if you take in too much. “Don’t start taking excessive amounts or you could get into trouble with high calcium levels in your blood,” Dr. Russo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But doctors also say that many people in temperate climates are likely to have lower-than-optimal vitamin D levels. If that describes you, “supplementation with a daily vitamin D pill is a generally good practice,” Dr. Adalja says. (Again, just check in with your healthcare provider first to be sure.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In terms of a flu-prevention strategy, Dr. Russo says that things like getting vaccinated, avoiding people who are obviously sick, and wearing a mask in crowded indoor settings are still better. “A vitamin D supplement is one more piece that may help,” he says. “There’s little harm as long as you don’t overdo it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Schaffner stops short of recommending that everyone take a vitamin D supplement for immune health. “If you have a special concern or interest in this, you can get a blood test,” he says. “Your doctor can tell you if you ought to take a supplement based on that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:33:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOQXM4N2VzXzdSc0puaWFVa0RkcUE3OVdub0xGVklkMXBaYUFzZWl5QXRLQnVHMjlrNHczM2RFdWdPZWVpNDU1ZENuNWdTeFpONjNvbGd5a0JLdzAydU5pOHBOSkJKWXNhRTZkRVNBZ0FyQW5TX0NveEV6T254Z3A4ZTNTdTg0THVMQTlfTURPTVQ3c1pUeXVRUDFJTldManJZRVBMRGRoR2w</guid></item><item><title>州数据显示，俄勒冈州的医院没有达到预防某些感染的国家安全目标- oregonlive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2026/01/oregon-hospitals-fall-short-of-national-safety-goals-to-prevent-some-infections-state-data-shows.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KMC5D7YOWFGNZBVUMYQDTISP5U"&gt;Oregon hospitals recorded nearly 1,000 infections that patients picked up while receiving care in 2024, resulting in infection levels that missed most national safety standards, according to a &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.public.health.division.acute.and.communicable.disease.pre/viz/HospitalHealthcare-AssociatedInfectionsDataDashboard2024/Overview?publish=yes&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.public.health.division.acute.and.communicable.disease.pre/viz/HospitalHealthcare-AssociatedInfectionsDataDashboard2024/Overview?publish=yes&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;new state report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6XY2DIJVWVD3PJNR6ANNKKVTL4"&gt;The Oregon Health Authority reviewed data from 61 hospitals statewide and tracked infections that develop after surgery, through catheters and IV lines and from drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as MRSA.

&lt;h2&gt;Diet downsides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the keto diet is popular among people trying to lose weight, particularly those trying to lose visceral fat, like the man in the case study. Anecdotal reports promote the keto diet as being effective at helping people slim down relatively quickly while also improving stamina and mental clarity. But robust clinical data supporting these claims are lacking, and medical experts have raised concerns about long-term cardiovascular health, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also clear downsides to the diet. Ketones are acidic, and if they build up too much in the blood, they can be toxic, causing ketoacidosis. This is a particular concern for people with type 1 diabetes and for people with chronic alcohol abuse. For everyone else, there’s a list of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499830/"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt;, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bad breath, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Ketogenic diets are also linked to high cholesterol and kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s one side effect that’s well established but little known and still puzzling to doctors: the “keto rash” or &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK599559/"&gt;prurigo pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt;. This rash fits the man’s case perfectly—red, raised, itchy bumps on the neck, chest, and back, with areas of hyperpigmentation also developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash was first identified in Japan in 1971, where it was mostly seen in women. While it has been consistently linked to metabolic disorders and dietary changes, experts still don’t understand what causes it. It’s seen not only in people on a keto diet but also in people with diabetes and those who have had bariatric surgery or are fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/drp/1993385"&gt;a review this month&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in Saudi Arabia noted that a leading hypothesis is that the high levels of ketones in the blood trigger inflammation around blood vessels driven by a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, and this inflammation is what causes the rash, which develops in different stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the condition remains poorly understood, effective treatments have at least been worked out. The most common treatment is to get the person out of ketosis and give them an antibiotic in the tetracycline class. Antibiotics are designed to treat bacterial infections (which this is not), but they can also dampen inflammation signals and thwart the activity of neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the man’s case, doctors gave him a two-week course of doxycycline and told him to ditch his keto diet. A week later, the rash was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

From single-minded status- and investment-focused self-interests to—dare we say it—a place somehow closer to representing the greater good? State to state, the work of the &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; Architecture lists suggests that, at the scale of the architect-designed custom house, it is indeed happening. Taking us past the beneficial requirements of building codes, a renewed focus on the relationship between architecture and sense of place, a new regionalism, has become impossible to miss. As a badge of honor, the development has rather clandestinely overtaken “Sustainability,” with its decades of exhausted rhetoric, and not a moment too soon. Just don’t let the deniers know that regionalism and sustainability are essentially one and the same. For now, we get to celebrate, in that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; getting there—closer to reaching critical mass in heeding the advice of Thoreau’s “Walking,” his famous essay calling attention to the lifetime of evercurious detail that awaits the person who commits to learning, within even a 10-mile radius of home, the nuances of their local terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-4 bleed" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj KNNlC"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;ABOVE: The 1-acre property gets its name from the 1,100-acre premier biking and hiking nature preserve that it overlooks, Betasso Preserve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="pGGCM2aD"&gt;David lauer&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to this very path of unearthing and, moreover, evidence of our progress is the Boulder, Colorado, architect Renée del Gaudio, since 2011 a one-woman shop specializing in site-specific residential work and known for taking on only the small number of projects that she, alone, can handle in any given year. Hers is a commitment to quality control and, ultimately, a far deeper level of overall engagement with the client, the site, and the design-and-construction processes, an approach that stems from having confronted deep personal loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del Gaudio directly experienced Boulder’s 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, which destroyed 169 homes, her cabin included, in the process of burning 6,181 acres. For the architect, the fire prompted an existential crisis, an exercise in soul searching and an exploration, amidst the psychologically lingering smoke and ash, of what was essentially called for, architecturally, in the region. She’d leave her position at a prominent, award-winning Denver architecture firm over it, breaking out on her own to begin offering precisely what she had determined the region’s post-fire environment demanded. As part of rethinking her overall creative outlook, she found herself looking back to find the right way forward, materially and formally: in the modest building materials and simple construction methods of the region’s metal-clad miner’s cabins of a century ago, structures built at a time when fires were simply left to burn, del Gaudio found certain truths. It was those discoveries combined with her foundational understanding and appreciation of the importance of “place architecture” (she earned her M.A. in Architecture from the University of Washington, an architecture school with one of the richest regionalist-Modern traditions in the U.S.) that set the course for her future work. Beginning with her own complete rebuild, an expanded house-studio where she and her family would ultimately reside and work (and still do), del Gaudio articulated the fundamental elements of her new architecture. Numerous awards for excellence soon followed, as did new commissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-7 offset" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;Corrugated metal was the final choice for the roof and the exterior wall cladding—decisions born out of a need for greater fire resistance. ABOVE: The front entrance, where the envelope's dark metal calls attention to the grain of the hemlock-clad soffits and the Douglas fir beams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="pGGCM2aD"&gt;David Lauer&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-11 bleed" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj KNNlC"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;"Ask yourself how you hope your space will feel, rather than how it will look," del Gaudio advises clients who are new to the process of working with an architect. "Avoid looking at precedent imagery too early in the process. Once you, or your architect, gets an image stuck in their head, the creative process is over." ABOVE: The living area, with its soaring 3"x12" Douglas fir double timbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="pGGCM2aD"&gt;David Lauer&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now fourteen years in, del Gaudio has recently completed Betasso Overlook, a house located only about 11 miles from her own house-studio. For how it reveals nearly all the elements of her evolved signature, the new house, built for a Chicago transplant with a background in design, is exemplary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The house’s main architectural gesture is the A-frame-like folded form of its metal roofs—plural because the plan is broken into three distinct volumes (working; living; and sleeping), with each resting on its own concrete pad that’s been distinctly placed to follow the slope of the site and with each interconnected by glass-enclosed exterior hallways. As in all del Gaudio’s work, wood is used prominently for its visceral impact, all of it naturally and boldly treated and effected with precise detailing. Structure, on principle, is exactingly expressed and exposed (in a world filled with things manufactured anonymously offshore, exposed-structure architecture lets us see how a house is actually put together, piece by piece, enabling a greatly deepened connection to it). Perhaps most striking of all, however, is that by moving the circulation to the exterior as the architect has, del Gaudio actively promotes movement &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the spaces, which in turn promotes discovery of how the house relates to prevailing winds, to the sun, and to landscape features and vistas—each its own story of the place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-75 offset" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;ABOVE: At an entrance to the glass-enclosed hall that connects the bedroom volume to the living-dining-kitchen volume, del Gaudio's attention to detailing the architecture's component parts comes into focus. As throughout the house, the fastening of the Douglas fir double timbers is handled meticulously, with precisely placed carbon steel bolts in a black oxide finish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="pGGCM2aD"&gt;David Lauer&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Betasso Overlook is the latest example of del Gaudio’s signature response to certain core region-specific questions that she routinely strives to answer, questions that every work of residential architecture should outwardly address but too often do not: Does the architecture “give back” to the landscape as much or more than it takes from it? Does it acknowledge the traditions of the landscape (flooding, extreme cold or heat, wind, wildfire)? Does it anticipate how people will inevitably evolve in their use of the house over time? Does it promote a deeper level of engagement with the place? Indeed, it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-14 bleed" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj KNNlC"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;ABOVE: Taking full advantage of Boulder's near-300 days of sunshine, the living-dining-kitchen areas, with their poured concrete floors, are designed to easily expand onto patios and decks that face the preserve.

"I craft the architecture until I can no longer imagine it anywhere else but in that specific place. Only then do I feel I have succeeded in creating something authentic."

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;These exercises are easy to weave into your day—and much more effective than gym machines.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;One of the most common frustrations that occurs with age is the natural loss of muscle and strength, known as sarcopenia. An &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3060646/" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 5% to 13%&lt;/a&gt; of those between the ages of 60 to 70 are impacted by this condition. In order to combat sarcopenia—and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-rebuild-lost-muscle-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;restore lost muscle&lt;/a&gt;—it’s important to engage in regular &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/strength-test-after-55/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;. And this doesn’t necessarily mean heading to the gym to use machines! We spoke with an expert who shares four daily exercises that get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why These Daily Exercises Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hit your 50s, maximizing your workout routine is essential. According to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.zinzino.com/site/mq/en-gb/blog/brand-ambassadors/meet-the-expert/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Colin Robertson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Product Office Zinzino, Sport &amp;amp; Nutrition Scientist, PhD in Exercise Physiology, exercises that recruit multiple joints are beneficial to weave into your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short, frequent bouts of loaded movement can raise weekly training volume with less fatigue per session, improving adherence and recovery. Daily, multi-joint patterns (squat/hinge/push/pull/carry) also reinforce motor unit recruitment and coordination, which tends to drift with age and inactivity, making the same muscle mass ‘harder to access.’ You’re not just rebuilding fibres; you’re rebuilding the ability to use them consistently,” Dr. Robertson explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to rebuilding muscle after midlife, gym machines present certain limitations—one of which is decreased demand of the stabilizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many machines offload trunk/hip/scapular control, so strength gains may transfer less to real-life tasks (stairs, lifting, balance),” Dr. Robertson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, machine-based exercises can under-train your gait, rotational control, and grip, which Dr. Robertson calls “key weak links for midlife function and injury resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another downside of gym machines? They’re typically only used two to three times a week in longer workouts. Many individuals in midlife benefit from more frequent, shorter doses that keep flare-ups and muscle soreness at bay while revving up stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Machines can be excellent for isolating and loading a target muscle, but they often provide less demand for coordination, bracing, and force transfer, which are exactly what many people lose after midlife,” Dr. Robertson adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 Daily Moves to Restore Muscle After 55&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises below are scalable and easy to perform without hindering your recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robertson instructs, “Pick two exercises per day, alternate A/B days, total time 10 to 20 minutes. The goal is consistent, recoverable exposure, more quality reps per week, not heroic workouts.” Aim to achieve a rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of seven to eight with two to three reps in reserve on working sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated at the front of a sturdy chair with your feet placed on the floor under your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean forward slightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to stand up without using your knees, hands, or additional support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to slowly sit back down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 to 5 sets of 6 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make the exercise more challenging, hold a kettlebell or dumbbell and slow your lowering (3 seconds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. (If you’re not comfortable working with dumbbells, use just your body weight.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees slightly and hold the weights in front of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your hips back as you lower the dumbbells down your leg. Maintain a straight back as you do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes to return to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start in a high plank with your hands under your shoulders and your body straight from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor. Maintain a long, straight body as you lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up, straightening your arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 to 5 sets of 6 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make this exercise more challenging, add a load, such as a weighted backpack or add a slow eccentric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a heavy dumbbell or kettlebell—50% of your body weight—in each hand at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start walking forward, keeping your torso still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 4 to 8 carries, walking 20 to 40 meters (or 30 to 60 seconds).&lt;/li&gt;

Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research shows that a deficiency in &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/orthopaedic-experts-share-5-foods-to-prevent-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-maintain-bone-health-during-sun-deprived-winters-101766582027818.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vitamin D"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” shared Robert.

Bacopa Monnieri&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert considers bacopa monnieri, or bacopa in short, as a less popular but extremely beneficial supplement.

NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Nicotinamide mononucleotide is a supplement that is becoming increasingly popular, as per Robert, who explains it as “a precursor to an important energy source” for both the body and the brain called NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;New research shows that a reduction of NAD in the brain is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” shared Robert, adding that substances like NMN that increase NAD in the brain can help improve brain function and memory, and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Patients could also be tested to see whether they would respond better to particular treatments, allowing for personalised care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the "life-changing and life-saving" tool would fast-track screening and allow more cancers to be caught sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Tens of thousands of cancer patients and those with a family history of the disease already undergo genetic testing on the NHS every year.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For men over 50, concerns like achy joints, heart health and maintaining muscle often start to feel more front-of-mind. And while inflammation isn’t always harmful—short-term inflammation plays an important role in healing and immune defense—&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation is linked to poorer health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, including a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, yes—sardines. They're rich in omega-3 fats, vitamin D, calcium and other important nutrients for everyone." He adds, "Most adults don't eat adequate amounts of omega-3 fats and sardines can help fill the gap for this nutrient and others."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Omega-3 fats are anti-inflammatory and the American Heart Association recommends eating seafood twice a week to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce the risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Omega-3's may also help reduce the risk of certain cancers, dementia and age-related macular degeneration.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not everyone loves sardines, but they work well in salads and pasta dishes. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249244/honey-soy-broiled-salmon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Honey-Soy Broiled Salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7944627/garlic-anchovy-pasta-with-broccolini/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Garlic-Anchovy Pasta with Broccolini&lt;/a&gt; are two other yummy ways to get your omega-3's.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries deliver an antioxidant punch. "Whatever the mix—raspberries, blueberries, blackberries—just eat a serving of berries," says Moore. "They're a rich source of antioxidants, and they also provide a good dose of fiber, a key component of the diet that older men are frequently missing." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries get their color from flavonoids, including anthocyanins, which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help reduce inflammation and disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The compounds in berries may also help keep hearts healthy by improving cholesterol, specifically decreasing LDL or "bad" cholesterol levels.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Eat them as is, or throw them in some Greek yogurt with a little granola for crunch," advises Moore. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8031379/dietitian-favorite-recipes-with-frozen-berries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Frozen berries are a great option&lt;/a&gt; to save some money and always keep berries on hand. They work well in smoothies and in these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blueberry-pie-inspired-overnight-oats-11721962" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Blueberry Pie-Inspired Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans and legumes may not be top of mind, but they are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-to-make-first-8770807" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;part of an anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; and contain many plant compounds that help reduce inflammation.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;Mohr notes,&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "The unsung hero of the nutrition world is fiber, and beans top the list as one of the best sources of fiber, among other nutrients as well." Hitting your fiber goals “can drastically lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and more," he adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans add a source of plant-based protein and can help improve the diversity of your gut microbiome, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce your risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and reduce chronic inflammation.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The polyphenols in beans have antioxidant properties to help keep you healthy. Eating beans may also help with weight loss.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mohr notes, "Beans are versatile, inexpensive and can complement almost any dish." Try them in soups, salads, casseroles and in this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-vegetable-breakfast-grain-bowl-8742347" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.

Cruciferous Vegetables &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Cruciferous vegetables, which include broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, are a good source of antioxidants and fiber," shares Moore. They're known for their key flavonoids, such as quercetin and kaempferol, which help reduce inflammation. Cruciferous veggies, in particular, when eaten as part of a balanced diet, are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vegan-vegetarian-cancer-risk-study-11790465" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;linked to reduced cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. That includes colorectal cancer and prostate cancer, two of the most common cancers in men.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moore likes roasting his veggies in the oven or in the air fryer with some salt and cheese. There are so many ways to enjoy more cruciferous vegetables: add kale to a salad, cabbage to stir-fry or add them to a soup, stew or curry like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/slow-cooker-cauliflower-chickpea-tikka-masala-8580545" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Slow-Cooker Cauliflower &amp;amp; Chickpea Tikka Masala&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mohr likes oats because they contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-foods-to-help-lower-cholesterol-11770161" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble fiber, which helps reduce your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber is important for your health in many ways, and it helps reduce inflammation because of what it does in your gut. Eating more fiber from whole grains, including oats, increases the production of short-chain fatty acids in your colon, which feed your gut bacteria, helps reduce your risk of colon cancer, and reduces inflammation in the gut.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber helps keep your blood sugar steadier, which can reduce oxidative stress from glucose spikes, and in turn tamps inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Oats also contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory compounds, like avenanthramides&lt;/a&gt;, to help reduce oxidative stress in the body.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Manage stress: "&lt;/strong&gt;Uncontrolled and unmanaged stress is well studied and fairly destructive at the cellular level. Long-term, it can even contribute to chronic illness," notes Moore. "I tell men all the time, build and maintain appropriate outlets that help you manage your stress, whether that’s exercise, sports or engaging in hobbies."&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly&lt;/strong&gt;: Research links exercise with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908639/the-fastest-way-to-reduce-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing chronic low-grade inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Find movement that you enjoy and commit to staying active. That might look like walking, swimming, cycling, jogging, lifting weights or yoga. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: It's recommended to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night but about a third of Americans aren't getting enough sleep. Falling short on sleep not only leaves you feeling tired, it can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-inflammation-ages-you-8744048" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Getting adequate sleep can also help reduce your risk of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Turn off screens before bed, limit caffeine in the afternoon and try to establish a healthy evening routine to be sure you're getting enough shut-eye.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; While the occasional beer or glass of wine isn't likely to do much harm, drinking alcohol can cause oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Keep your alcoholic drinks to a minimum for your overall health and for the most anti-inflammatory diet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might feel overwhelming to start making changes to your diet, but there's no need for an overhaul. Start small by adding a handful of berries to breakfast or making oatmeal a few times a week. "It’s never too late to start," adds Moore. "There’s still plenty of life ahead of you. Make a simple change today, do it again tomorrow, and keep that practice going until it becomes habitual."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these anti-inflammatory foods can benefit everyone, they may be especially important for men over 50 to help improve gut health, heart health and reduce the risk of certain cancers. When you think of an overall diet to reduce inflammation, aim to eat a variety of colorful plant foods and a well-balanced diet. And it's not about perfection. "The most important factor is consistency with any lifestyle habit, whether it is a dietary change, lifestyle change or other," notes Mohr.

Probably. According to the NHS, many UK adults spend upwards of nine hours each day sitting down. But too much sitting could seriously damage your health, according to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sitting-for-long-stretches-raises-heart-and-diabetes-risks"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from Brunel University – even if you meet weekly &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We reviewed the published evidence available regarding associations between sedentary behaviour [sitting or lying down] and different risk markers for &lt;a href="/topic/heart-disease"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in people aged 60 and above,” says sedentary behaviour specialist Dr Daniel Bailey who is, perhaps predictably, stationed at a standing desk during our video call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review found that people who sat down for large chunks of their day were far more likely to have a higher waist circumference and body fat levels. They also recorded worse readings for several biomarkers linked to heart disease and diabetes, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides and cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those risks were there regardless of the amount of physical activity these older adults were engaging in,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much sitting is too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people spend upwards of eight hours at a desk each day. Add in the journey home from work and sofa time watching telly, and it’s easy to see how daily sitting times are so high for many of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the past few decades, we’ve seen all of this technology come into play, which gives us more opportunities to sit down,” Dr Bailey says. “With that, we have seen a massive increase in obesity and the diseases that come with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data suggests older populations are the most sedentary group, and it is this demographic that will likely experience the greatest benefits from cutting down their daily sitting time. However, Dr Bailey adds, “It is an important consideration for all ages,” with studies on children and working-age adults also linking excessive sitting to increased health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some studies show the threshold is somewhere between seven and 10 hours of sitting per day being too much,” Dr Bailey tells me. “That’s where your risk of early mortality and several different diseases really starts to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/strength-training-for-longevity-b2826608.html"&gt;The science-backed exercise method that can help fight the effects of ageing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if you move less, you burn less energy during the day, which can contribute to weight gain. Muscles can lose strength when unused, joints can become stiff, and because you are asking less of your heart and lungs each day, fitness can fade away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bcLYNA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/08/16/woman-work-desk.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/08/16/woman-work-desk.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/08/16/woman-work-desk.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Many people spend nine hours or more of their day sitting down, according to the NHS" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-264724"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Many people spend nine hours or more of their day sitting down, according to the NHS&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the negative effects of excessive sedentary time are linked to the amount of time you spend sitting down at a time. “There have been a number of studies that show the benefits of breaking up your sedentary time every 30 to 60 minutes,” explains. Dr Bailey added that the mechanism behind this is not yet fully understood. He describes it as a series of “metabolic switches that help regulate blood sugar, glucose levels and cholesterol levels.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not doing regular muscular contractions, these metabolic switches switch off. That’s when we get higher levels of glucose in the blood, higher cholesterol in the blood, and our blood pressure isn’t as well regulated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10000-steps-walking-workout-heart-health-b2886117.html"&gt;If you struggle to walk 10,000 steps a day, a scientist recommends trying this instead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to fight back&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary ways to fight the negative effects of sitting down is to do less of it, and to ensure you are getting regular muscular contractions – ie using your muscles and moving. Based on his research, Dr Bailey prescribes trying to move in some form every 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/24/13/iStock-2210705103.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/24/13/iStock-2210705103.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/24/13/iStock-2210705103.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Regular muscular contractions – through moving or simply standing up – can combat the negative effects of too much sitting" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-264725"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Regular muscular contractions – through moving or simply standing up – can combat the negative effects of too much sitting&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every movement counts,” he says. “We’ve published a lot of studies in our group that show how regular, short bouts of light activity keep these metabolic switches turned on, and your blood sugar levels and cholesterol stay lower throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t need to be structured exercise. Simply standing up seems to be beneficial in people that are overweight, obese or have type two diabetes. We’ve also looked at slow walking – people can get these metabolic benefits from things we do in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every half an hour, get up, move around for a few minutes, and that should help reduce your risk of the different diseases we’ve discussed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-snacking-workouts-heart-health-b2859776.html"&gt;The science-backed two-minute daily workouts for improving heart health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another easy change Dr Bailey suggests is reorganising your workstation to encourage more movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changing your setup so not everything is at hand can help,” he explains. “If you need a pen, to print something or put something in the bin, having those things located away from your desk might encourage you to move more often. And rather than sending a colleague an email, go and talk to them at their desk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iLHiBm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/15/12/iStock-2194826147.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/15/12/iStock-2194826147.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/15/12/iStock-2194826147.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Daniel Bailey recommends moving for a few minutes every half an hour where possible" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-264726"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Dr Daniel Bailey recommends moving for a few minutes every half an hour where possible&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also make a conscious effort to move after you finish certain tasks at your computer, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you might ignore an alert to move from your wearable or an app because you are working on something. Instead, wait until the end of a task, then use that as your cue to get up and move around. If you’re working from home, you could spread your housework across the day rather than doing it in one big chunk, and use these opportunities to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reap the benefits &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the results of reducing your daily sitting time and making even these small tweaks are pretty remarkable. “If we can limit our sedentary time and be physically active, we’re going to live a longer and healthier life, which is what I think we’re all striving for,” says Dr Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Benefits you might see and feel quite quickly are [a] better mood, more energy and less fatigue. Then, in the longer term, you might start to see reductions in body fat or body weight because you are burning more calories from movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The deeper impacts won’t be as obvious, but you could benefit from a reduction in blood sugar levels and a reduction in blood pressure.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH) has confirmed two additional measles cases in Maricopa County residents, including one with no known source of exposure. This confirms that measles is now spreading within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new cases underscore the growing risk of local transmission and the importance of vaccination and early symptom recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For decades, we’ve had enough community immunity to prevent spread of measles like this,” said Dr. Nick Staab, chief medical officer for MCDPH. “If you’ve been hesitating or wondering if you should get the measles vaccine, this is a reminder that measles can spread rapidly and can be very serious—and that you can protect yourself and those around you with a proven, effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public exposure sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCDPH has identified three additional public locations where people may have been exposed to measles as a result of these cases. Individuals who were at the following locations at the listed dates and times may have been exposed and should watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" class="fr-alternate-rows"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Location&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Watch for symptoms through this date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1515 E.

Serious, long-term complications from measles infections include subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain infection which may not appear until years after a person’s initial measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable with two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, typically given during childhood. Adults need at least one dose of MMR vaccine given after the age of one. Individuals born before 1957 or who had measles as a child are considered immune. In alignment with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html"&gt;CDC guidance&lt;/a&gt; in the setting of a local measles outbreak, MCDPH recommends infants aged 6-11 months to get early MMR vaccination in addition to the 2 scheduled doses at 1 year and 4-6 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Preventing continued spread of measles is a community effort,” added Dr. Staab. “Raising immunization rates in our community will help us avoid future occurrences of community transmission like we are seeing now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms to watch for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who may have been exposed should watch for symptoms, which appear typically seven to 12 days after exposure but may take up to 21 days. Symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever, which can spike to 104 °F or higher&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, and blotchy. The rash begins after other symptoms, usually on the face at the hairline, and moves down the body. The rash may last five to six days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if symptoms develop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether an individual has known exposure or not, &lt;strong&gt;individuals who develop symptoms are encouraged to seek medical care and testing.&lt;/strong&gt; They should call the provider ahead to let them know about symptoms and potential exposure before going in. The provider or facility will provide instructions on how to be seen without exposing others in the waiting area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCDPH is encouraging healthcare providers to be alert for unvaccinated patients with fever and rash, especially if they have a known exposure. Healthcare providers are required to report suspect cases of measles to their local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccination is the most effective way to avoid measles infection and serious outcomes. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unvaccinated people have a 90% chance of becoming infected if exposed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A does not prevent measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the rare case where a vaccinated person gets infected with measles, their illness will be less severe than if they were unvaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no treatment for measles, and it can have serious outcomes. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An individual with measles can get supportive care, but there are no treatments to relieve symptoms or shorten duration of infection. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While less common, measles can result in death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measles is highly contagious. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who are infected can spread measles to others before symptoms develop, while they still feel normal. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents can check their immunization records to see if they are up to date on MMR and other vaccines.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents can visit &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/immunization/azmyir/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;myIR&lt;/a&gt; via the Arizona Department of Health Services. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assistance is also available through the MCDPH CARES Team at 602-506-6767 Mon.-Fri. from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you do not have the recommended doses of MMR vaccine or are unsure if you do, talk with your healthcare provider about next steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on measles, visit &lt;a data-fr-linked="true" href="//Maricopa.gov/measles"&gt;Maricopa.gov/measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

More recently, health officials have said they detected an outbreak of leptospirosis in the camp. Credit: Adahlia Cole for Berkeleyside&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City and county health officials’ detection of a &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2026/01/13/eighth-harrison-lepto-outbreak-northwest-berkeley-bhu"&gt;leptospirosis outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in and around a longstanding &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/06/04/berkeley-eighth-harrison-homeless-encampment-sweep"&gt;Northwest Berkeley homeless encampment&lt;/a&gt; has many in the neighborhood worried about what it means for them and their pets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veterinarians found leptospirosis in two dogs within the encampment around Eighth and Harrison streets, both in November, one of which died, and later detected the illness in &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2017/01/19/rats-chew-car-wires-enter-homes-in-berkeley-hills-causing-costly-damage"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in five years in Alameda County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of the Jan. 12 announcement there were no known human cases. City officials did not respond to Berkeleyside’s inquiries, sent Thursday, as to whether that has changed. County officials said that they are continuing “to monitor the area and trap rats,” and “to provide support to the residents of the encampment on their rodent issues.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bacterial pathogen, rare in the developed world, is treatable with antibiotics, and there are vaccines for dogs and other animals.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Berkeleyside has compiled some information on the disease and its risks from public health and veterinary medicine experts, as well as city health officials.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-just-how-dangerous-is-leptospirosis"&gt;Just how dangerous is leptospirosis?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC there are only about 1 million human cases of leptospirosis a year, most of those in developing countries and primarily in tropical climates, since the bacterium thrives in wet environments. Of those cases about 60,000 end up becoming fatal. In 90%of cases, humans and animals recover without any treatment, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441858/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However uncommon in the United States and other wealthier countries, untreated cases of leptospirosis can lead to kidney and liver failure, meningitis and death. And because it is so rare, and its symptoms so common to other illnesses, doctors and veterinarians sometimes do not think to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most people who are exposed don’t get it — only about 10% get symptoms,” Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told Berkeleyside in a phone interview. And of that 10% who develop symptoms, only 10% — or about 1 in 100 people exposed — develop severe symptoms, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The illness can be more dangerous to people who are immunocompromised or have diabetes, liver disease or kidney disease, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In pregnant people the bacterium can pose a deadly risk to fetuses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-catch-leptospirosis-and-how"&gt;Who can catch leptospirosis, and how?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A map from Berkeley health officials puts the epicenter of the outbreak at Eighth and Harrison streets. The “red zone,” or most at-risk parts of the neighborhood, are Harrison Street from Cedarwood Lane to 10th Street and two blocks each of Eighth, Ninth and 10th streets, one each on either side of Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lower-risk “yellow zone,” radiating out ⅓ of a mile from Eighth and Harrison, “there is no evidence of active transmission of leptospirosis or of unmitigated rat populations,” according to the Jan. 12 announcement. “However, proximity to the encampment red zone creates risk and need for prevention efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis is zoonotic — meaning it can jump between species — but is not airborne, and not transmitted by coughing or sneezing. The most common route of transmission is by way of urine from infected animals, either directly or by way of contaminating water or mud. If animals drink contaminated standing water, or if the bacterium comes in contact with cuts or mucous membranes (eyes, mouths, noses) on people and animals, they can contract the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The illness can spread by bites that break skin, or pass from infected mothers to their young. The bacterium can also linger on plants that have come into contact with contaminated water or mud, making it prudent to wash anything harvested in contaminated areas. While the bacterium can persist for months on end in contaminated water, it typically dies off when puddles and pools dry out, and is &lt;a href="https://www.nhsborders.scot.nhs.uk/media/197827/Leptospirosis-June-2014.pdf"&gt;susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to disinfectants and heat over 112 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wild animals that come into contact with the bacterium are at risk, but dogs are generally regarded as the most common domesticated animal to contract it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats, too, can contract leptospirosis, though compared with dogs, frequently show much milder symptoms or no symptoms at all. But while the illness might not hurt a cat directly, an infected cat can continue to shed the bacterium for years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis can also spread to livestock and marine mammals. Sea lion populations along the California coast generally see surges of the illness every three to five years, though there was an unexpected surge in cases this summer, &lt;a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/bay-area-sea-lions-sick-deadly-bacterial-disease-transmissible-humans-pets"&gt;KTVU reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-i-prevent-transmission"&gt;How do I prevent transmission?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While there is no human vaccine, there is a canine vaccine for leptospirosis — an initial series of two shots followed by annual boosters. There are also vaccines for cats, cows, goats, sheep, pigs and horses. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/pets/index.html"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; vaccinating all animals possible “even if they get leptospirosis because the vaccine might cover different strains, and it may help avoid more severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said folks passing through the area should cover open wounds and take other common-sense precautions like washing hands, but “people don’t have to worry about casual pedestrian exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While people probably should not wade into the creek, nor play in puddles, “I think they don’t have to worry about it too much, not to be too panicked about it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For unhoused people living in the area, the greatest risk is to their dogs. Chin-Hong recommended they keep their pets leashed, get pets vaccinated where possible and use hand sanitizer if and when running water is not available to clean and disinfect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-symptoms-and-treatment-for-leptospirosis-for-humans-dogs-and-cats"&gt;What are the symptoms and treatment for leptospirosis for humans, dogs and cats?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The most prominent signs that dogs are infected are fever, muscle tenderness and lethargy, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). “Other signs may include loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice … inflammation of the eyes, bloody nose, urine or stool and changes in the amount and frequency of urination,” according to the organization’s page on the illness.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In humans, the bacterium brings on fever, headache, chills, body aches, jaundice, red eyes, stomach pain, rashes, vomiting, nausea and diarrhea, according to the CDC. Because so many of these symptoms mimic other illnesses, leptospirosis is frequently mistaken for something else, and some people never show symptoms at all, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans generally become ill sometime between two and 30 days after contact, though symptoms most commonly present five to 14 days after exposure, according to the CDC. Patients typically experience flu-like symptoms in the first phase of illness, but may also enter a second, more severe phase that could bring on kidney or liver failure or meningitis, or inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors and veterinarians can test for leptospirosis in patients’ blood and urine. In humans and animals, the disease is treatable with antibiotics. Some veterinary experts &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/leptospirosis"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that early detection is crucial in dogs to prevent permanent liver or kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said that because leptospirosis is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it might fall to patients or pet owners to bring it up with doctors and veterinarians.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-guidance-does-the-berkeley-health-department-give"&gt;What guidance does the Berkeley health department give?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley Health, Housing and Community Services Department has issued a series of recommendations for those who live, work or visit in the area that may be contaminated:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are camped in the area, move at least a third of a mile away&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;RVs and other vehicles with long-term rat infestations should be destroyed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean all “non-porous” property — bicycles, tools, hardware and so on — by removing all visible mud and debris with soap and water and then disinfecting with a 10-to-1 bleach-water solution, leaving it on for at least 10 minutes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Destroy any “contaminated soft goods” like blankets or tents that have been on the ground&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Throw out any food, beverages or water with which rats may have come into contact&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If coming into contact with mud or standing water in the encampment, or with items that were previously exposed to them, wear masks, waterproof boots, eye protection and nitrile or rubber gloves; do not let mud, runoff or water touch skin, mouths, noses, or eyes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Treat creek water, puddles and any other standing water in the area as contaminated; do not walk or bike through standing water or the creek&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate dogs and free-roaming cats; keep pets on short leashes; bring water for walks and do not let pets drink from other sources&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When gardening, wear gloves and protective foot coverings&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wash any fruits and vegetables harvested in the area before consuming&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If you think your pet has been exposed to leptospirosis, or is showing signs of illness, contact your veterinarian immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lawrence sees early flu peak as some health care providers require masking&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six viral diseases — including COVID-19, the flu and norovirus — have been found at high concentrations in Lawrence wastewater as Kansas communities face peak flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19, influenza A and B, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and norovirus have all been detected at high concentrations in Lawrence &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/4niF8mr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; within the last three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lawre-507379751df59046d9a030f03d59d14c lawre-content_2" id="lawre-507379751df59046d9a030f03d59d14c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data indicates trends of illnesses spreading within a community but does not correlate to exact case numbers, with doctors saying it’s normal to see high concentrations of respiratory illness during flu season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater data does not measure individual cases, but it provides a reliable picture of how much virus is circulating in a community,” said Veronica White, preparedness and epidemiology coordinator for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health. “This data captures viral genetic material shed by everyone using the sewer system. One factor that may be contributing to the higher concentrations of respiratory viruses seen in Lawrence’s wastewater is its larger population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawrence is also seeing an early peak in influenza B compared to the rest of the country. Positive flu tests spiked the last week of 2025, with 32% of total flu tests coming back positive, according to data from the University of Kansas Health System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health care providers such as Watkins Health Center at the University of Kansas are requiring masks for all visitors, patients and staff due to a “record surge in respiratory illnesses,” according to a sign at the front door.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White said early rise in the flu doesn’t indicate a more dangerous flu season, but rather earlier circulation of the virus than usual. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Identifying this trend early through wastewater data allows people to take preventive steps, such as getting vaccinated, monitoring symptoms, and staying home when sick,” White said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data also indicated that a newer strain of COVID, known as the XFG or the Stratus variant, has accounted for 82.5% of positive COVID samples, with concentrations increasing by 25% in the last month. The variant has also been increasing nationally, White said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dana Hawkinson, medical director for Infection Control and Prevention program at University of Kansas Health System, said there are still large populations of people across the state who have not received a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There have been a large number of people ill and circulators too in our communities. But (the flu) still remains at a high level at this point in time,” Hawkinson said. “There have been extremely low numbers of people not getting the vaccine. We know that we can help prevent this and people’s chances of severe illness and death with it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Steve Stites, chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System, said that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7chEnUW0EI?si=2KN1bC2byLQI_f0H&amp;amp;t=678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are incredibly safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said flu symptoms include fever, cough, congestion, body aches and a sore throat rather than stomach bug symptoms, with the definitions often getting mixed up during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="lawre-c9b79c6582bb301aaf6b39082e01c8ce lawre-bonus-banners" id="lawre-c9b79c6582bb301aaf6b39082e01c8ce"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data has also indicated that Salina is seeing medium concentrations of the same illnesses, except for influenza A, which is considered to be at a high concentration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Based on the data, we expect viral activity to continue in both Lawrence and Salina over the next few weeks,” White said. “As we move through flu season, we anticipate seeing elevated influenza activity reflected in the wastewater, especially as the season approaches its typical peak.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical experts continue to advise washing hands, covering coughs and not going into large public spaces when sick to prevent illnesses from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can still go get the flu vaccine,” Hawkinson said. “It’s still recommended, and you can do it now to protect yourself from infection.”&lt;/p&gt;
