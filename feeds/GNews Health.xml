Despite not being at the epicenter of the outbreak, the number of people being vaccinated has increased, according to Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're 75 miles east of the actual outbreak, but we're seeing an increase in the number of vaccinations that we're giving in our community," she told ABC News. "Over the last four weeks, our health department has been operating a walk-in vaccine clinic that's just for MMR, and that vaccine clinic [has] administered a little over 300 vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She added that health officials have seen multiple babies under 6 months old who have been exposed to measles. Because they are too young to be vaccinated, they have been given shots of immunoglobulin, which are antibodies that act as a post-exposure prophylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wells said the vaccines are available at no cost, and health officials have been trying to spread the word over social media and the local news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So we're kind of just getting the people that, I think, either their children are behind on vaccines, just because parents get busy and it's hard to get your four-year-old sometimes into the doctor's office, or people that were kind of on the fence about vaccines and maybe said, 'Well, I don't want to vaccinate my kids, because you never see measles.' But now that you're seeing measles, they're bringing their children in for vaccinations," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In conversations with colleagues in nearby health departments, such as in epicenter Gaines County, Wells has said it's been harder to reach residents to distribute the MMR vaccine, making the process somewhat of a "struggle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She explained that in Lubbock, the health department building is large -- with most residents knowing where it is -- and the department has more outreach staff than smaller departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think it's a little bit harder in some of these rural areas, because they're setting up in places that might not be as familiar to individuals," Wells said. "They're finding different locations in order to have those clinics; they're starting to focus a lot more on school-based clinics. So, let's go to where the children are and get the parents to come to that school and then offer the vaccine there, which I think is a great tactic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, in nearby New Mexico, the state Department of Health (NMDOH) &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 43 measles cases so far this year. Most of the cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders western Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials suspect there may be a connection between the Texas and New Mexico cases, but a link has not yet been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Data from NMDOH provided to ABC News shows that between Feb. 1 and March 24 of this year, more than 13,100 MMR doses have been administered.

			&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; in the break room at work could contain high levels of substances that elevate levels of 'bad' cholesterol in your blood – but there's a simple way to reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diterpene"&gt;Diterpenes&lt;/a&gt; are compounds made by plants that have a variety of effects on the human body. Two of them – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol"&gt;cafestol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahweol"&gt;kahweol&lt;/a&gt; – have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20174238"&gt;linked to increased levels&lt;/a&gt; of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. &lt;span&gt;High levels of these compounds have been found in coffee, but it seems to depend on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-best-way-to-brew-coffee-depends-on-what-you-want-from-your-java"&gt;how you extract it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish researchers measured the levels of diterpenes in coffee made by a range of common coffee machines and brewing techniques. They found that boiling a big pot of coffee is the worst offender, but you can easily offset those levels by filtering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee machines commonly found in workplaces around the world also produced cups of joe with relatively high diterpene levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We studied 14 coffee machines and could see that the levels of these substances are much higher in coffee from these machines than from regular drip-filter coffee makers," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says David Iggman&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical nutritionist at Uppsala University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From this we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team calculated the benefits for a person drinking three cups of coffee a day, five days a week. Swapping the machine coffee for a nice paper-filtered java could reduce LDL cholesterol by enough to cut the relative risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by 13 percent over 5 years, and 36 percent over 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected samples from 11 machines that brewed coffee from grinds mixed with hot water and passed through a metal filter, and from a further three that mixed a liquid coffee concentrate with hot water without filtration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the team also brewed coffee themselves using a range of methods, including drip-brew, percolator, French press, and boiled coffee. Samples from each method and machine were then frozen for storage and transport, before being analyzed for diterpene concentration. &lt;span&gt;In addition, the team collected four espresso samples from three cafeterias and a workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg" alt="How You Make Your Coffee Could Affect Your Cholesterol Intake" class="wp-image-156189 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-728x415.jpg 728w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-768x438.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-1536x875.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-600x342.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol.jpg 1555w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;How the different brewing methods stack up in terms of cafestol concentrations. (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;Orrje et. al, &lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, 2025&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that manual methods of brewing coffee generally resulted in lower diterpene levels than grabbing a cup from a machine, &lt;span&gt;whether it be a brewing machine, a liquid-model machine, or a traditional espresso maker&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a glance, espresso seemed to be the worst way to make coffee, with a median cafestol level of around 1,060 mg/L. But there were only four samples analyzed and their levels varied wildly, from 35.6 to a staggering 2,446.7 mg/L. As such, it's hard to pull much meaning out of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee from liquid and brewing machine models had a median cafestol concentration of 174 milligrams per liter, and 135 mg/L of kahweol. French presses produced coffees with moderate diterpene levels, coming in under 90 mg/L for cafestol and under 70 mg/L for kahweol, while percolators had similar readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best option seemed to be paper-filtered drip brews, clocking a median of just 11.5 mg/L of cafestol and 8.2 mg/L for kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception was boiled coffee, a typically unfiltered method that's common in countries such as Sweden. Getting your  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; fix this way resulted in a massive mean concentration of just under 940 mg/L of cafestol and nearly 680 mg/L of kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg" alt="filtering coffee" class="wp-image-156292 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Filtering coffee could make a big difference to your health. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEdcijLL8g/"&gt;Andreantian/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it's easy to slash those levels. When the researchers filtered their boiled coffee through fabric, concentrations dropped to just 28 mg/L for cafestol and 21 mg/L for kahweol. They used a sock for some reason, but any cloth or paper filter should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also acknowledges that the study has major limitations, including small sample sizes and variables that went unaccounted for, like filter pore size, water pressure, and temperature, and how the beans were roasted and ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings join a growing and often conflicting body of research into the health effects of coffee – and it's hard to know how it all fits together. Other studies, for instance, have found that drinking three or more cups of coffee per day could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;lower your risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cardiometabolic diseases by 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular coffee consumption has also been linked to lower risks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-coffee-and-tea-drinkers-could-be-lowering-their-risk-of-dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-help-protect-against-parkinsons-study-says"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-protect-against-certain-types-of-skin-cancer"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-tea-or-coffee-each-day-could-reduce-mouth-and-throat-cancer-risk"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-dramatically-lowers-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-coming-back"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It could offset the negative health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting"&gt;prolonged sitting&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;extend your life&lt;/a&gt; by years. But that could all depend on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/four-cups-of-coffee-a-day-might-be-the-perfect-amount-of-your-heart"&gt;how many cups&lt;/a&gt; you down per day, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;what time&lt;/a&gt; you drink them – and now, how you brew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says Iggman&lt;/a&gt;. "For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it's clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(13 News) - Casino Del Sol has confirmed that a norovirus outbreak caused the cancellation of a large convention over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Wild Wild West Steampunk Convention was set for March 20-23 at the casino. But on Saturday, Casino Del Sol canceled the rest of the event over “ongoing medical concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;On Tuesday, the casino sent a release to 13 News and explained more about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness,” the casino said. “An individual associated with the event informed Casino Del Sol management that a guest of the group reported that she had norovirus and at least two attendees were already ill before arriving at the event. By Saturday, March 22, additional attendees, as well as a few Casino Del Sol team members, reported experiencing stomach flu-like symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Wild West Steampunk Convention &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/843226430/Wild-West-Steampunk-Convention-news-release" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;issued a news release&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and said it had not received an official reason for the cancellation until Casino Del Sol issued its release to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It seems Casino Del Sol has put out a press release this evening confirming norovirus as the cause of their decision to close Wild Wild West Con,” the WWSC wrote. “We want to be clear that this is the first time we have been made aware of this development and it was provided to the press rather than to our staff or management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;13 News went to the casino Saturday and saw no signs about the event on the property or near the conference center, where it was held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Pascua Yaqui Tribal Medical Authority and the casino said it “took immediate action to mitigate potential health risks.” The casino reported that the conference center, public restrooms and the rooms the ill guests were staying were deep cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Several people on social media complained about the short notice for the cancellation. The casino said vendors and attendees were told two hours ahead that they had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately,” the casino said. “While we recognize that this created challenges for some vendors, the health and safety of all guests and team members had to take priority in order to prevent potential further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Some people on social media also complained about the lack of information that was released during the weekend and the fact that the casino remained open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate,” the casino said. “Our priority throughout this process has been the well-being of our guests, team members, and the greater community. By acting quickly, we were able to contain the situation and reduce the potential for further illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Still others on social media called out the WWWSC for deleting a social media post made Saturday afternoon. The WWWSC said it did so “at the insistence of (Casino Del Sol) in an effort to maintain a working relationship during a difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The WWWSC said it asked Pima County about the incident and was told “the Pascua Yaqui Health Department is managing the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entire Casino Del Sol Statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness.

By Saturday, March 22, additional attendees, as well as a few Casino Del Sol team members, reported experiencing stomach flu-like symptoms.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;In coordination with the Pascua Yaqui Tribal Medical Authority, Casino Del Sol took immediate action to mitigate potential health risks. Out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to conclude the event early and begin a deep cleaning of the conference center. Additionally, all hotel rooms that housed event guests were placed on hold to undergo a deep cleaning and sanitization process, in line with our already rigorous cleaning protocols.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vendors and attendees were given two hours’ notice to vacate the event space. This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately. While we recognize that this created challenges for some vendors, the health and safety of all guests and team members had to take priority in order to prevent potential further spread.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some hotel guests experienced a disruption to their stay, while others did not. This was based on the origin of the reported illness. As an added precaution, all occupied hotel rooms and public restrooms underwent an enhanced deep-cleaning and sanitization process in addition to the hotel’s already robust and comprehensive cleaning procedures for every room. Guests who were not affiliated with the event were not impacted by this precautionary measure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate.

Researchers have now discovered that postpartum female mice develop a long-term preference for cooler environments, driven by brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes involve a specific group of neurons in the preoptic area (POA) that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Postpartum mice showed reduced warm sensitivity and increased cold sensitivity in these neurons, helping explain their new thermal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Postpartum mice preferred cooler environments for over four weeks after weaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Mechanism Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The shift was linked to reduced activity of ERα-expressing neurons in the preoptic area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive Experience Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Deleting estrogen receptors in these neurons in virgin females mimicked postpartum behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mothers experience major metabolic adaptations during pregnancy and lactation to support the development and growth of the new life. Although many metabolic changes have been studied, body temperature regulation and environmental temperature preference during and after pregnancy remain poorly understood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and collaborating institutions show in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; that postpartum female mice develop new environmental temperature preferences and reveal brain changes mediating these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108242"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and baby." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Supporting this finding, the researchers found that virgin females in which the estrogen receptor alpha had been deleted in ERαPOA neurons also preferred lower temperatures and avoided warmer locations, mimicking postpartum females. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In both humans and mice, body temperature increases during early pregnancy, drops to normal temperature during late pregnancy and then goes up again during lactation,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Chunmei Wang, assistant professor of pediatrics at USDA/ARS Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Wang and her colleagues investigated what changes occurred in the brain that mediated the new temperature preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We worked with mice and found that female mice prefer a cooler environment starting from late pregnancy and persisting in long-term postpartum,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For more than four weeks post-weaning female mice had a lower body temperature and preferred cooler environments; they lost their typical preference for warm environments (30 &lt;a&gt;°&lt;/a&gt;C/86 °F) but still avoided cold environments (15 °C/59 °F).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the biological underpinnings of these changes, the researchers studied the preoptic area (POA), a brain region important for sensing and regulating body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that the change in temperature preference in postpartum female mice was associated with a significant decrease in a particular group of neurons, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-expressing neurons in the preoptic area of the brain (ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons),” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this finding, the researchers found that virgin females in which the estrogen receptor alpha had been deleted in ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons also preferred lower temperatures and avoided warmer locations, mimicking postpartum females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking closely into the ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, the researchers found that these neurons vary in their ability to sense warm or cold temperatures – one group of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons can directly respond to warmth, while another group responds to cooler temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, compared to female mice that had not been pregnant, ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons of postpartum females had reduced response to warmth and an enhanced response to cold,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the results support that the ability of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA &lt;/sup&gt;neurons to sense warmth and cold is regulated by reproductive experience and leads to changes in temperature preferences that alter the animal’s warmth-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the researchers are exploring the function of each group of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons on the regulation body temperature and thermal preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include Nan Zhang, Meng Yu, Qianru Zhao, Bing Feng, Yue Deng, Jonathan C.

The number and activity of ERα-expressing POA neurons (ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;) were assessed using immunohistochemistry and in vitro electrophysiology in response to temperature changes and ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025a"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We showed that female mice prefer a cooler environment starting from late pregnancy and persisting long term postpartum. Female mice with RE (&amp;gt;4 weeks post-weaning) displayed lower body temperature and a lower thermal preferred temperature, and lost preference for warm environments (30 °C) but preserved avoidance of cold environments (15 °C).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was associated with a significant decrease in the number of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Importantly, virgin female ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;-KO mice displayed lower thermal preferred temperature and impaired warm preference, mimicking RE mice. We further found that distinct ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations can be regulated by temperature changes with or without presynaptic blockers, and by ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, RE decreased the number of warm-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and reduced the excitatory effects of warmth and estrogen-ERα signaling, while cold-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were slightly enhanced in female mice with RE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030a"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results support that the thermosensing ability and estrogenic effects in ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are regulated by reproductive experience, altering thermal preference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9WeFpHdEdOMXV1TGtTOHNEVXpUWThhUTBXOW41THozQ0wzaGlLODJ5bDk3VXZzN0FMdWFPM0JiNWl6bDNRVEh4Nld3WnFKaTExSXprRHRLbDZEeHYydlMyUlJHU3lGaFlYbmlfbFJRQ1c0UQ</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine skeptic hired to head federal study of immunizations and autism - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNeHd0cUdpVXZra0JMY1FTRFo3SWtWTWFPY190OG9HbE0zTDlyaE8xeDNWZjJuSkhRbzhUejNlMmh1eXlKeXh0U0d6ZEhFeXpJeUZ3bW03Qmt3V01DQkVOQTZWdnZpd3lHc1kyWkM5d09HSmtoQXJVMy02Z19EWUhCSjljTUpkUjN6bVliSmR1WjdQQXBTb3JTSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLFJMKAJMZHLLC7ATDVDOJ5ACU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A vaccine skeptic who has long promoted false claims about the connection between immunizations and autism has been tapped by the federal government to conduct a critical study of possible links between the two, according to current and former federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NXYZMVKG45AQBHTJ47S2ON4WDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Using advanced MRI scans and blood tests, researchers identified elevated iron in key brain regions and signs of nerve damage in ADHD patients compared to healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers are known precursors to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The findings suggest a potential biological mechanism linking ADHD to a higher risk of dementia later in life, underscoring the importance of early ADHD diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron Accumulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with ADHD had increased brain iron in regions associated with cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerve Damage Indicator:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated blood levels of NfL, a marker of axonal damage, were found in ADHD patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The combination of iron buildup and NfL suggests ADHD may increase the risk of age-related dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An adult brain affected by attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) presents modifications similar to those observed in individuals suffering from dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the findings of a study conducted by the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and the University of Geneva (UNIGE) which shows that, compared with healthy individuals, patients with an ADHD diagnosis have more iron in certain regions of their brain along with higher levels of neurofilaments (NfL) in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers have been consistently reported to be characteristic of old age-related dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease and can be measured in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108238"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that ADHD may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life and it provides first evidence for a neurological mechanism possibly involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This significant step forward is described in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 3.5% of adults according to a 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) study. It is characterized by an inability to maintain attention along with inappropriate levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although symptoms generally manifest during childhood and significantly affect educational development and social interactions, its effects can persist and adversely affect daily functioning in adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old age-related dementias affect about 55 million people globally, with almost 10 million new cases each year according to WHO statistics from 2023. Alzheimer’s disease represents 60 to 70% of these dementia cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent epidemiological studies show that adults suffering from ADHD have an increased risk of dementia at an advanced age, but the mechanism through which ADHD constitutes a risk is not known,” states Professor Paul G. Unschuld, Head of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry of the HUG, Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and the initiator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron and neurofilaments as indicators &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used an advanced brain imaging method, known as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine iron content in the brain of 32 adults between 25 – 45 years of age affected by ADHD and 29 healthy individuals in the same age bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) levels in the blood of the participants were measured in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study reveal notable differences in iron distribution in several regions of the brain of the individuals affected by ADHD. Furthermore, a significant association was established between iron levels in the precentral cortex and NfL levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron plays an essential role in normal brain functioning, but its excessive accumulation may cause neuronal damage and lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess iron in certain regions of the brain is often observed and is associated with increased oxidative stress that furthers neuronal degeneration,” specifies Professor Paul Unschuld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the NfL is an indicator of neuronal damage in the brain, more specifically of neuronal axons which are essential for nerve transmission. High blood levels of NfL reflect axon damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, an increased brain iron and NfL levels may indicate an underlying neurodegenerative pathology and an increased risk of neurodegenerative dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of early detection and management of ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries pave the way for new research into understanding why persons with ADHD may be at increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Paul Unschuld believes that the information provided by this study “will enable targeted prevention strategies to be developed to reduce the risk of dementia in persons affected by ADHD. This is especially important since there is a well-known correlation between lifestyle and altered iron levels in brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To achieve this, additional longitudinal studies are required in order to determine if a reduction of iron levels in the brain is a potential treatment pathway for preventing dementia at an advanced age in persons with ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the relationship between ADHD and dementia underlines the importance of early detection of these diseases. It also highlights the importance of proactive management of ADHD in adults, not only to improve quality of life for individuals but also to prevent long-term consequences on cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by a SPARK grant awarded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) to Professor Paul G. Unschuld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dementia and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a5b544e5553545f145d4f5f54554e7a4f54535d5f145952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Antoine Guenot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unige.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Antoine Guenot – University of Geneva&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pcn.13806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain iron load and neuroaxonal vulnerability in adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt;” by Paul G.

Here, we investigated the liability for neurodegenerative brain disease in adult ADHD, possibly reflected by increased brain iron content and associated neuroaxonal vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two adults with ADHD (35 ± 10 years) and 29 age- and sex-matched controls (32 ± 12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), standardized psychometric testing and assessment of lifestyle factors. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to assess magnetic abnormalities indicating local alterations of iron deposition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By calculating QSM-maps, local iron deposition was tested for statistically significant differences between ADHD and healthy controls. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured as an indicator of neuroaxonal integrity by using a fourth-generation ELLA immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain iron content differed in persons with ADHD, with strongest effects observable in the right precentral cortex (healthy controls: 0.0033 ± 0.0017ppm; ADHD: 0.0048 ± 0.0016ppm; &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;(59) = 3.56, &lt;em&gt;P &amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt; 0.001). Moreover, right precentral cortex iron in persons with ADHD was associated with increased blood NfL levels (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(1.57) = 13.2, &lt;em&gt;P =&lt;/em&gt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate altered regional iron content in the brains of adults with ADHD. The observed association between increased precentral magnetic susceptibility and increased NfL suggests a connection between local excess of brain iron and neuroaxonal damage in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the limited sample size of the current study and the naturalistic medication plan, further longitudinal studies are needed to establish whether altered brain iron distribution in adults with ADHD may be associated with an increased risk of dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:37:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFB4X0lsdWlJRThhdmVtUVU0ZUdFRUNHazZ2UDYxZE5uQm5pSDFTU1VSTDg2ejlqYUlGUmp6Nk9kZkxDVVI4LU52UUpyeDZSNXJRQTljVXlaaXNxTFNWX3VDQ2NIdVNaLVVWa0RuY0ZYOA</guid></item><item><title>Measles vaccine: Can young children get an early dose of the MMR shot? - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-worried-getting-worse-texas-measles-outbreak-grows-families-resist-va-rcna196873" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in the first three months of 2025 than in all of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the 420-plus cases have been centered around the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt; outbreak, which has spilled over to neighboring &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/ok-measles-update.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Other cases in people returning from travel abroad have been reported in a handful of states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection, but the first dose of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/childhood-vaccines-adults-booster-shots-measles-texas-what-know-rcna193197" target="_blank"&gt;measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; usually isn’t given until a child is 12 to 15 months old. A second dose is given from ages 4 to 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That schedule leaves children under 1 vulnerable. Some parents, however, are opting to give their young children a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pediatricians-walk-delicate-line-parents-measles-vaccination-debate-rcna194226" target="_blank"&gt;dose of the vaccine ahead of schedule&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock — an epicenter of the current outbreak — said that parents are calling to request an early dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve almost doubled the amount of vaccine we administer on a typical month,” Montanez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20routine,elapsed%20since%20the%20first%20dose).&amp;amp;text=There%20are%20no%20recommendations%20to,MMR%20vaccine%20during%20measles%20outbreaks." target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Protecting-Your-Baby-from-a-Measles-Outbreak-FAQs.aspx#measles-travel-baby" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; say that, in the case of an outbreak or international travel, children as young as 6 months can get a dose of the vaccine, and children under 4 years old who have gotten one dose can get their second one earlier. All doses must be separated by at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Shilpa Patel, a pediatrician at New Jersey Hackensack Meridian Health Medical Group Northern Valley Pediatrics, said that an early dose before 12 months is essentially a bonus dose, and doesn’t take the place of either of the two standard doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It does not count for the total,” Patel said. “You still need two doses after the age of 12 months.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez said that’s because, “at this age of development, their immune system isn’t quite developed to where the vaccine would provide prolonged or lifelong immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Therefore, we would have to give another dose at a year and essentially a third dose at 4 to 6 years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While early doses are typically recommended when traveling abroad with children, Patel said she’s also starting to recommend the vaccine for kids traveling to some parts of the U.S., including Texas and Disney World in Florida. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/measles-outbreak-traced-disneyland-declared-over-n343686" target="_blank"&gt;Theme parks&lt;/a&gt; have been the sites of measles outbreaks in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Don Gibson, 36, and his wife considered early vaccinations for their two sons, now ages 2 years and 4 months, as they prepared&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in January to travel from California to Texas for an April wedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We were really excited to go, and they invited our kids, too, so we were going to take the whole family, but, then, after we booked our travel, including lodging, flights, we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak happening in Texas&lt;/a&gt;,” Gibson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This prompted a conversation with the family pediatrician, who said they could give an early second dose for their 2-year-old and a dose for the infant when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reached 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The wedding, however, would occur before the infant hit 6 months, and ultimately the family decided to cancel their plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patel said that she’s even started offering an early dose to families who aren’t traveling, but who are concerned about rising measles counts in their neighborhood, pointing to the &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;three measles cases&lt;/a&gt; recently identified in her home state, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For now, doses for domestic travel and for patients in places without active outbreaks are being given at the discretion of individual doctors and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7146a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;no official recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling domestically to places experiencing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some are calling for changing that to include a flexible third dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In an article earlier this month in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831828" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, former CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and several other experts proposed codifying an extra dose for high-risk domestic travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez noted that it’s unclear whether insurance will cover an extra dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She said that 80% of her patients are on Medicaid and have their regular immunizations covered by the Texas Vaccines for Children program. But, because these particular doses are given outside of the standard schedule, it remains unclear whether they will be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, the extra dose is the parents’ choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If you decide you want to do this, you are welcome to,” Montanez said. “If you don’t want to do this, you don’t have to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:27:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE</guid></item><item><title>For Some Measles Patients, Vitamin A Remedy Supported by RFK Jr. Leaves Them More Ill - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5WN3RzNzZZNlF0QkE3QzQwOGktWU5yR2RZemZ6VllWUUI3TV9nTEtCQm9Dc2RYYkkwcWRFaHl6RUNLbkRYS0dBNUZXaEhLTjJTa0syUzdLWGNGcDRScFl0VWl0S1pCbkZNclJPZHYtc0wzVTYzWVpBMUYwN0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors in West Texas are seeing measles patients whose illnesses have been complicated by an alternative therapy endorsed by vaccine skeptics including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One of those supplements is vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of them had received unsafe doses of supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I had a patient that was only sick a couple of days, four or five days, but had been taking it for like three weeks,” Dr. Davies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While doctors sometimes administer high doses of vitamin A in a hospital to manage severe measles, experts do not recommend taking it without physician supervision.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are still largely unsure what's behind the epidemic, but obesity, diets high in processed meats and sugar, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental exposures like microplastics and antibiotics are several of the top theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While bloody stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits are tell-tale signs of colon cancer, Ms Comer had no symptoms leading up to her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the only sign of trouble was elevated liver enzymes during a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver enzymes are proteins that help the liver produce and break down bile and rid the body of toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer that has spread to the liver damages protective cells and can lead to excess enzymes flooding into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer told ABC 7 News that following her diagnosis, she would spend eight to 11 hours three days every other week in doing chemotherapy treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also underwent seven surgeries to remove the tumors from her liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after 180 rounds of chemotherapy and between 60 and 70 scans, Ms Comer made the decision to stop treatment and enter hospice care at home this year due to the lasting wear and tear from chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It wasn't a difficult decision. There were no treatment options that were working and the chemo was making me sicker so I couldn't recover.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Comer, pictured here with her husband and daughter, is now in hospice care and focusing on encouraging young patients to get screened for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said that over the years, her advice to young people and doctors has stayed the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm really a pain in the butt. I keep saying the same thing - screen early,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45. Prior to 2021, this began at age 50, making Ms Comer miss the age requirement to catch her cancer before it spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said: 'To the problem in your life, you are the answer and you are the solution. You have to figure it out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is no longer seeking treatment, she noted her husband and 17-year-old daughter have helped keep her from giving up on life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Who would want to leave, who would want to leave this beautiful world with all this kindness?' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:22:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPaEdLdkE3eHZFOV9BdkZiZXdKdUJvaXVRU0pDQ0ZKSXc0UkcxeVdndmduMEZJUUR1Umx0YlN6dGdqRmVselVXVHpGLTQtVXhCTlY2d29kamN0STZvcXU5Y1p6ZERsVWpYc2k3LVpQRTR4aGRQTHE4MTBIWXZCRlJscjdSZ2Z6WGtMVVRkWC11c3NzUnlnMUZ5SElRR2V1TWFG0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5kdF9YR1lFZmxmX2p3UGZiZkhtWmFORGQtV3BVSVFTazRka2xrSDJMLVZqa0VjcmxrdWxoUmJPckFoT1p3VkJZQ0ZqRVVRU1JaSWtudk1FSHpDaTE2ZFVqcnU5a3FqWG9oQ3JYdnVsTmVHaVM1a3RFSkJhdHhPWjA5aV84QW83cFkxUXpvc2lBNUVxLURLdnVfNnNMV3RBYjZXTzNLMkE</guid></item><item><title>Is Creatine the Midlife Wonder Supplement You’re Missing? - Oprah Mag</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFA3MUFHbHVLalJaSERkU3ZFODJhdC00MTNMS3JlVHBPQ0VjS2VTb3ozYmlVV2JTaGpoY0ZqNnRaOFBvOUhDOWl3aldkNEthUWR1TU9QbzFRVjAtb21IMlZFVVA0SjB5M0FFYTFydGxwZ050eFFNOUhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="body-dropcap css-1p2egzz emevuu60"&gt;When Laura Taft, 62, first started supplementing with creatine at the suggestion of her trainer, it was with her muscles in mind. “I wanted to resist bone density loss as I age,” says the Brooklyn resident. But within a few weeks of taking creatine daily, Taft clocked a benefit that she hadn’t anticipated: a cognitive one. “In addition to strength building, creatine has been really helpful with lifting my brain fog,” she says. The best evidence of that, she adds, may be that she remembers to take it every day. Taft’s experience reflects a broader shift in creatine’s target audience. Once a word rarely heard uttered outside of powerlifting circles, nowadays creatine is attracting new interest among women—and middle-aged women at that.

Creatine is produced in your liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and the majority of it (around 95 percent) is stored in our skeletal muscles, says Stacey Ellery, PhD, a pregnancy physiologist and research group head of biogenetics in reproduction at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia. But while the body may naturally produce creatine, that amount covers only a portion of what your muscles use, particularly if you’re active or working on building them, says board-certified ob-gyn &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mary Claire Haver, MD" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Mary Claire Haver, MD&lt;/a&gt;. And though creatine is also found in animal-based foods like red meat, poultry, and fish, for your body (and brain) to really reap the benefits, you’d need to eat a few pounds a day. Hence: supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="3" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How creatine helps muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In the ’90s, supplementing with creatine rose to popularity among the body-building masses, as did the first wave of scientific studies supporting its ability to bolster muscle mass. How does it do it? “Creatine phosphate stored in muscles is responsible for supplying energy for quick anaerobic bouts of muscle contraction,” says Heather A. Milton, an exercise physiologist supervisor at NYU Langone Health. We use those CP stores within 10 to 30 seconds, she adds, so the higher the stores we have in the muscles, the more our energy output. “This means creatine provides more capacity to lift a heavier load and withstand fatigue while doing so, and that increased strength of work produces greater muscle growth,” says Milton. So you’re able to train harder, lift heavier, and, crucially, recover faster, because creatine is key both for muscle metabolism and muscle repair.  But it’s important to remember that taking creatine alone won’t magically grow your muscles. “It’s the increased capacity to train that most people experience when taking creatine that results in increased muscle mass and exercise performance,” says Ellery.&lt;br data-node-id="4.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="6" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How the rest of your body may benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While the research on creatine and muscle is long-standing and robust, newer research points to additional benefits. One area is the brain, which makes sense, considering that the brain relies on ample amounts of ATP (which, as a reminder, creatine helps create) to function. “When creatine stores are low, brain cells may have a harder time keeping up with the energy demands of thinking, processing, information, and managing stress,” says Haver. Thus far, says Bayati, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies have shown" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; creatine to be beneficial for &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/81/4/416/6671817" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/81/4/416/6671817" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cognitive function " data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;cognitive function &lt;/a&gt;in stressful situations or with sleep deprivation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="8" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1eiql25 e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-2xuljx eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-40esvh e1pe3zr90"&gt;Studies have shown creatine to be beneficial for maintaining cognitive function in stressful situations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-15j1ztq eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another area of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.4135" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.4135" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research growth is reproductive health" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;research growth is reproductive health&lt;/a&gt;. “Estrogen levels affect creatine metabolism and play a role in both the synthesis and bioavailability of creatine,” says Bayati. This is why creatine levels fluctuate with your menstrual cycle and other hormonal changes, like the drop in estrogen during menopause. Not to mention that key players in the reproductive process (sperm, uterus, placenta, and fetus) rely on creatine as a source of cellular energy. “Observational studies suggest that in some cases, low creatine levels are associated with fertility complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes,” says Ellery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Why women in midlife may be the biggest winners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine is not a one-size-fits-all recommendation for every woman hovering around midlife. But most doctors agree that, besides vegans and vegetarians (who noticeably lack it in their diets), middle-aged women stand to benefit from it because it can help mitigate the loss of muscle and bone mass, as well as the brain fog that is common in perimenopause. The fact that creatine not only increases exercise performance but also specifically targets changes in energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress associated with insufficient estrogen is huge for women in midlife, says Ellery. She adds that creatine is also fast becoming a therapeutic intervention of interest for diseases more prevalent in female populations, such autoimmune and major depressive disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For Veerle Arts, a 39-year-old strength and mobility coach and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Breuckelen Athletic" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Breuckelen Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, New York, a podcast interview with &lt;a href="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stacy Sims" data-node-id="12.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Stacy Sims&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, talking about creatine in the context of women’s health and performance benefits first piqued her curiosity. “After taking it for four weeks, I began to notice that I could scale up my workouts and sustain a higher intensity. Around the six-week mark, I felt clearer, like my brain fog had lifted. And two months in, I had noticeably put on more muscle,” says Arts, adding that she has been taking it for 10 months and has no plans to stop. “Most of my female clients over 40 are either considering creatine or already taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="13" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1eiql25 e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-2xuljx eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-40esvh e1pe3zr90"&gt;Around the six-week mark, I felt clearer, like my brain fog had lifted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-15j1ztq eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Are these supplements safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine’s use as a dietary supplement has been studied for decades, and it is widely regarded as safe. In the ’90s, it got some negative press due to a case study linking it to kidney injury, says Ellery. But that study has since been debunked and superseded by thorough safety reviews. (Still, people with kidney issues should check with their doctors before taking the supplement.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Because the supplement market is wildly and widely unregulated, paying attention to source and quality are key, says Milton. Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard, says Haver—specifically products that are third-party tested (like those certified by the &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://cleanlabelproject.org" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clean Label Project" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Clean Label Project&lt;/a&gt;) for purity, potency, and contaminants. The clinically effective dose that doctors usually recommend is 3 to 5 grams a day, though people who are keen to saturate their muscles faster, says Haver, will sometimes “creatine load,” which involves taking a higher dose (20 grams per day, split into four doses) for five to seven days. “But that isn’t necessary, especially if you’re in this for long-term health and maintenance.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Consistency matters more than anything else, and, as with any supplement, it’s important to note that there is a range of responsiveness: Some people experience mild side effects like water retention or gastrointestinal upset, and some people experience a benefit while others don’t.  Additionally, many doctors recommend taking it for up to five years, since its effects beyond that time frame are not well documented. The bottom line? For women eager to shore up their mental and physical strength in midlife, it may be worth trying.&lt;br data-node-id="17.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="body-tip css-tax92z emevuu60"&gt;Any content published by Oprah Daily is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The breakfast staple is an excellent addition to &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/how-to-make-a-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, hearty oatmeal, or, on its own, slathered in peanut butter. And, as a fruit with natural packaging, it's easy to carry on the go for a quick snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We've all heard the saying, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." For many, the versatile fruit is a regular part of the daily diet. But just how healthy is it to eat a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/best-banana-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt; every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian nutritionist, shares her insight on everything we need to know about eating bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Health Benefits Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, let's get to the nutrition. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, one medium banana has about 105 calories, 27 carbs, 14 grams of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, and 422 mg of potassium. It's also a good source of other nutrients like vitamin C and vitamin B6 and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:electrolytes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, including magnesium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It is estimated that 90% of Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegetables;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; every day," Manaker says. "So, if someone wants to eat a banana every day, that can be a great habit to get into to get some fruit servings in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Potential Downsides Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But bananas might not be the ideal pick for everyone. Manaker says they might not be the best choice for those following a low-potassium diet or those who get elevated blood sugar after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bananas contain carbohydrates and sugars, which raises questions about whether they're a healthy food for people with diabetes. However, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, bananas contain resistant starch, similar to fiber, and release less glucose into the bloodstream than non-resistant starches, like white bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to their carb content, bananas are known for their potassium, an important electrolyte vital to cell and muscle function and heart health. Potassium and sodium work together and need to be in balance. Hyperkalemia occurs when your blood potassium levels are too high, although this condition is rare. Medical experts estimate that only 2% to 3% of people have high potassium levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For a generally healthy person, it is unlikely to experience hyperkalemia by eating one banana a day, especially if the rest of their diet isn't excessively high in potassium-rich foods," Manaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So yes, a banana a day is most likely safe. But this depends on your individual health and diet. Overall, Manaker recommends people eat a variety of fruits and veggies. "While eating a banana every day isn't bad for many people, it may be more beneficial to eat different fruits, with bananas sprinkled into the rotation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She adds that the amount of bananas someone can eat in a day depends on the rest of their daily diet. For someone with a stomach bug who can only stomach bananas, she said that having more than one is likely acceptable. But it's probably not the best idea for those eating many bananas on top of "mass quantities" of carbohydrate-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As they say, too much of anything—even fruits—can have its downsides, so it's best to aim for a balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tired of plain old bananas? Put your produce to use with a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/healthy-peanut-butter-banana-smoothie-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:peanut butter banana smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;peanut butter banana smoothie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/banana-nut-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana nut bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;banana nut bread&lt;/a&gt; (to use up those super ripe ones).

                                        &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles in southwest Kansas continues to grow. &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;State health data shows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 10 people in Grant, Stevens and Morton counties, all under the age of 18, have tested positive for measles since the start of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas Department of Health and Environment first &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported a measles case in Stevens County March 13&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating it was the first measles case in Kansas since 2018. But the state’s measles dashboard also shows two cases, one in January and one in February. A state health department spokesperson said those cases were “retrospectively identified” and part of the current outbreak. The eight other cases were recorded this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said during a health conference in Wichita that state officials are closely monitoring the outbreak and are ensuring infected people are isolated. She also urged Kansans to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are safe and effective,” Kelly said. “I have two kids. They were both vaccinated. They are alive and well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classify a measles outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as three or more cases linked to each other. This makes Kansas one of the most recent states with a measles outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas has the largest outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 300 cases of the measles. Health experts say the disease can lead to serious complications, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has confirmed one death amid the outbreak in Texas. In New Mexico, health officials are investigating the cause of death for a person who tested positive for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of the illness in Kansas comes as state lawmakers in Topeka are considering a bill that includes loosening vaccine requirements in child care regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is aimed at reducing specific fees and training requirements for early child care facilities. But a provision expands religious exemptions for vaccines that are required for child care programs. The Kansas House recently approved the bill with bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas vaccine advocates argue the requirement changes could reduce vaccine rates amid a growing public health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more unvaccinated children you have in a setting, the more likely it is that measles or whatever will go through the population,” said Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director for Kansas Interfaith Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is measles? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus. It spreads through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection and prevention at the University of Kansas Health System, said the illness can linger in the air for up to two hours. He said he expects to see the number of cases in Kansas rise because of how easy measles spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the decrease in overall vaccine rates, I think we have to expect there to be more cases,” he said, “Just because the less people vaccinated means more people that are susceptible to the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles can potentially cause severe health problems, like pneumonia. In rare cases, it can lead to brain damage and deafness. He said one in five people who contract measles are hospitalized and it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be a very devastating disease,” Hawinkson said. “It is unfortunate because we know we have the best proactive safety measure, and that is the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials say nine of the 10 Kansans who tested positive for measles were unvaccinated, and one was under vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symptoms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles symptoms typically start like a common cold. An infected person may have a fever, sore throat, runny nose and mild cough. About two to three days later, the person may develop white &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spots in their mouth, known as Koplik spots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. About three to five days later, the person will develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a red, splotchy rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which Hawksinson said usually starts on a person’s head and face and then spreads downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/measles-keeping-family-safe.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Experts say if you suspect you or your child has measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s best for them to stay home away from other people. Hawkinson said it’s also important to call ahead before bringing someone with a possible infection to the doctor, emergency room or urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really best to call ahead so that they can take those preparations into account, so that they can protect other people in those areas,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department website has more information about &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1501/Measles-Rubeola#:~:text=Providers%20%26%20LHD%20Resources%20Table%20Section,not%20wait%20for%20test%20results." class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles and what to watch for.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson encourages full vaccination against measles as the best way to avoid contracting the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a vaccine that has been used for five to six decades,” Hawkinson said. “It has a great history of safety. It has a great history of effectiveness at preventing disease and especially the complications of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;There are two types of vaccines for measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: MMR and MMRV. Children need two doses of either vaccine to be fully protected against measles. The first dose should be administered when a child is between 12 and 15 months old and the second should be when a child is between four and six years old. However, the MMVR second dose can be administered as early as 3 months after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said now is a good time to check you and your family’s vaccination status. He said unvaccinated children and adults or people who didn’t receive both doses of the vaccine should consider getting them now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

About 90% of Kansans are vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, state lawmakers have challenged vaccine requirements in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas House recently approved a &lt;a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/hb2294/?link_id=1&amp;amp;can_id=ddf8202ea341214def057893c988d994&amp;amp;source=email-action-alert-tell-your-house-member-to-protect-the-kansas-supreme-court&amp;amp;email_referrer=email_2662630&amp;amp;email_subject=action-alert-on-childhood-immunizations&amp;amp;&amp;amp;" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing or eliminating fees and training requirements for child care facilities. That bill includes a provision that adds moral and ethical opposition to the definition of religious exemptions for vaccines that children are required to get before attending child care programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, said the change is reckless. He said most major religions approve of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In anti-vax sentiment, sometimes it’s called 'religious' but actually, it is more about people’s fears,” Rieber said. “There’s not really a religious basis for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said changing the definition of religious exemption for vaccine requirements at childcare facilities could also open the door to changes for K-12 public schools, which require several other vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said he supports expanding access to affordable child care in Kansas, but the amendment could harm vaccinated and unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is the potential for this to be a precedent that would then take away the ability of the school or the facility to actually protect their children by not allowing unvaccinated children to be in the setting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on the House floor did not discuss the details of the bill or the reasons to include the vaccine exemption changes before voting to approve it. The bill is now in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough in safely delivering therapeutic DNA to cells could transform treatment for millions suffering from common chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A new process that transports DNA into cells using tiny fat-based carriers called lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) developed by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania improved the process of turning on the DNA's instructions in mice to make proteins inside cells, which is crucial in fighting disease. Signs also point to an improvement in reducing treatment risks, such as immune reactions, as compared to older DNA transfer techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's findings were recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02556-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nobel Prize-winning work sets the stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new approach builds directly on the genetic medicine revolution that began at Penn: the development of safe messenger RNA (mRNA) therapies used in COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For 20 years, DNA delivery with LNPs has been a major goal in this field," said Jake Brenner, MD, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Medicine and Pharmacology. "We're picking up where mRNA left off to tackle bigger challenges."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their Nobel Prize-winning work, Penn's Katalin Kariko, Ph.D., and Drew Weissman, MD, Ph.D., showed how to modify mRNA to make it safe for delivery in the body. Since then, mRNA-based treatments have entered &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for a variety of vaccines and for delivering CRISPR proteins to edit genes in rare diseases. While mRNA therapies have advanced rapidly, they have limitations for chronic conditions because mRNA breaks down quickly in the body and cannot easily target specific cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA delivery offers a compelling solution to these challenges. Unlike mRNA, DNA remains active in cells for months or even years and can be programmed to work only in targeted cells. However, past attempts to use LNPs to deliver DNA failed because they triggered severe immune reactions—when loaded into standard mRNA-LNPs, DNA was lethal to 100% of healthy mice in laboratory tests. For two decades, researchers recognized DNA delivery's potential but considered it impossible due to these safety barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Solving the safety puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brenner's team discovered why previous attempts to deliver DNA using LNPs were dangerous: These particles triggered the body's internal alarm system—a defensive pathway called STING that normally helps fight infections but causes harmful inflammation when activated inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STING detects viruses, bacteria, or damaged DNA. To counter STING-induced inflammation, researchers studied the approach Kariko and Weissman had used 20 years earlier to make mRNA delivery safe: modifying nucleotides (the building blocks of mRNA and DNA). While that approach turned out not to work for STING's interaction with DNA, it led Brenner's team to the key finding: Cells produce a natural anti-inflammatory molecule called nitro-oleic acid (NOA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding this protective molecule to the DNA-carrying particles, the researchers completely eliminated the fatal reactions that had previously made this approach impossible. In &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/laboratory+tests/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;laboratory tests&lt;/a&gt;, all mice receiving the improved DNA delivery system survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this advancement, treated cells produced the intended therapeutic proteins for about six months from a single dose—much longer than the few hours seen with mRNA therapies. Compared to viral methods commonly used for gene therapy, these DNA-LNPs can carry larger genetic instructions, cause fewer &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+reactions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune reactions&lt;/a&gt;, target specific cells more precisely, and can be given multiple times without losing effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For 20 years, the use of DNA-LNPs for DNA delivery has been a major goal in the field of genetic medicine," Brenner said. "This technology holds incredible promise—not just to treat diseases, but to fundamentally change how we address health challenges that affect millions. It builds directly on Penn's pioneering work in mRNA and represents the next generation of precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies will focus on further refining the technology and testing its effectiveness in different tissues and disease models.&lt;/p&gt;

Her death certificate attributed the cause to Valley fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roselia died on August 24, 2016 from a heart attack. Her death certificate attributed the cause to viral fever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley Fever - which got its name because a majority of cases are found in Arizona and California - is a deadly lung infection that kills one in 100 people who contract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, there were approximately 200 coccidioidomycosis-associated deaths each year from 1999 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley fever is caused by the fungus coccidioides, which &lt;span&gt;is swept up into the air when soil contaminated with the fungus is disturbed by wind or digging. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;States usually report a total of 10,000 to 20,000 cases of Valley fever yearly. In 2024, Arizona - where most cases emerge - reported a total of 11,801 confirmed and probable cases of Valley fever, higher than last year's total count of 10,990.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When humans or animals breathe in the spores, they travel through the respiratory tract and into the lungs where they reproduce and spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, skin and liver through the bloodstream. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it infects the membranes and fluid around the brain and cause life-threatening meningitis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease, for which there is currently no preventative vaccine, can often be missed by doctors or misdiagnosed as pneumonia as it presents with similar symptoms such as fatigue, cough, fever, aching muscles and breathlessness.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include blurry vision, cognitive decline, hearing changes, night sweats, joint aches and a red rash, usually on the legs but occasionally on the chest, arms and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no current cure and patients are given treatments to manage symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evidence suggests the fungus that causes Valley fever lives in the soil of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, parts of Mexico, Central America and South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since Texas is one of the states that does not require reporting and the number of Valley fever incidents across the area remain unknown, nobody in Roselia's family had ever heard about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Evidence suggests the fungus that causes Valley fever lives in the soil of Arizona, California, Nevada and New Mexico. Texas is one of the states that does not require reporting and the number of Valley fever incidents across the area remain unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talking about her mother's final days, Aide told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://elpasomatters.org/2025/03/24/valley-fever-el-paso-dust-storms-disease/"&gt;El Paso Matters&lt;/a&gt;: 'My mom doesn't play around like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What damaged my mom more was we didn't know what it was, so we didn't know how to treat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Mom felt like she was going crazy, Now I want everyone to know it doesn't just happen to people living in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-35462820-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-35462821-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-35462822-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9" class=""&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It's present [in Texas], too.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr &lt;span&gt;Armando Meza, an infectious disease physician at &lt;/span&gt;Texas&lt;span&gt; Tech Health, El Paso, who was not involved in Roselia's care, over half of the people suffering from Valley fever do not show clear symptoms and usually only have a cough and fever, like many other common respiratory illnesses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Sometimes it's not easy to make a diagnosis because doctors just think they have simple &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-47892500-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and give antibiotics, but those patients will not get better, they will get worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There is no proven cure for Valley Fever and patients are usually prescribed rest and given therapies to manage symptoms. Mild cases also tend to clear up on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may prescribe antifungal medications, but there is no evidence from clinical trials that show these treatments are effective - and antifungal drugs come with the potential for serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Armando Meza, an infectious disease physician at Texas Tech Health, El Paso, over half of the people suffering from Valley fever do not show clear symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, El Paso has been experiencing frequent dust storms that have left residents battered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the region used to see about two to three dust days in the early months of the year, it has already recorded eight days of blowing dust this March alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The county was placed under a Weather Authority Alert last week after winds blew winds from 35 to 45 mph and gusts reached 65 mph. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have since warned locals that these dust storms are much worse than previous years and can negatively impact their physical health as airborne particles can cause numerous illnesses including Valley Fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple local and federal agencies have asked El Paso residents to stay indoors and avoid traveling during these storms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her mother's death, Aide said she tries to ask every doctor and nurse practitioner she meets if they have heard of Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She claims that probably two out of three experts she encounters do not know about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aide said: 'It's just to spread awareness. Maybe somebody else doesn't have to go through what my mom did, all the experimenting, wondering if it's this or that. Maybe they can figure it out faster.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That priority has fallen by the wayside in the second Trump administration, with the termination of a number of grants related to HIV in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most notable was the sudden withdrawal of $18 million per year for a program dedicated to understanding how to diagnose, treat, and prevent HIV infections and AIDS in adolescents and young adults, who account for about &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-adolescents-and-young-adults#:~:text=Adolescents%20and%20young%20adults%20(AYA,get%20it%20through%20sexual%20transmission." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;19% of new infections annually&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. On Friday, the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention was notified that the two &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10993597#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10880572#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grants&lt;/a&gt; that support its operations had been halted by the National Institutes of Health, in a move that legal experts say may be found illegal if it were challenged in court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the loss of the program — during the third year of the seven-year grants — would mean ceasing research that could help expand the populations that might benefit from emerging treatments. The network has two ongoing trials studying a potential preventive &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20168%20HAPPY%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;treatment for HIV and pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and assessing the effectiveness of sexual health counseling and behavioral therapy to &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20170%20IMPACT%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reduce HIV transmission in adolescents who use stimulants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

In case you’re not familiar, amyloid is found, but in the brain it clumps together to form "plaques" between nerve cells. Too much build-up of these amyloid plaques in the brains can lead to issues with brain function and is linked to Alzheimer's, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute on Aging" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). But we'll get to more of that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For the study, the researchers gave the study participants an experimental anti-amyloid drug. They found that 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study's start and who took the drug the longest (an average of eight years) had a 50 percent lower chance of developing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-the-treatment-cure-alzheimers" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="8.0"&gt;Will the treatment cure Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers didn’t study the impact of the treatment on people who already have Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, they looked at people with a very high likelihood of developing it who were within 10 to 15 years before they were expected to develop the disease based on their family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So, the treatment is more geared towards delaying or halting onset rather than curing an existing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-amyloid-plaques-and-what-do-they-do-in-the-brain" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;What are amyloid plaques and what do they do in the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Amyloid plaques are areas where amyloid (again, a protein) has built up, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amit Sachdev," data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“You can think of it a lot like a scab on your skin,” he says. “The scab is rough, it isn't supposed to be there and, if it gets too thick, it causes a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But there is some debate about whether targeting amyloid will help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil," data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Targeting brain amyloid is not a slam dunk for Alzheimer’s prevention as we do not have any tests that are in use clinically to predict Alzheimer’s onset,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Most neurologists liken [amyloid plaques] to skin freckles, which are normal aging phenomena  and extremely infrequent[ly] became a skin cancer,” Dr. Segil continues. “Many Alzheimer’s scientists liken them to unexploded land mines which, if left alone, will cause older people to lose the ability to tie their shoes and all but surely get Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-this-treatment-break-down-the-amyloid-plaques" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;How does this treatment break down the amyloid plaques?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The treatment uses anti-amyloid antibodies to break down the plaques, Dr. Sachdev explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“The anti-amyloid antibodies attach to amyloid and use the immune system to remove it,” he says. “This is very effective, because the immune system is excellent at getting rid of things that do not belong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Sachdev also says that the drug relies on inflammation to clear the plaques. (Think of it like this: Inflammation is a natural bodily response to kickstart healing in the body, bringing various cells and biological tools to the site of injury to repair it. The treatment seems to trigger inflammation.) “More than 50 percent of patients who were exposed in this study had changes to their brain [including potential for swelling and bleeding] that could be related to inflammation,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As such, these medications come with the risk of brain bleeding, brain swelling, and brain shrinkage, making them risky to use, Dr. Segil points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-this-treatment-be-available-to-the-public" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Will this treatment be available to the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Not yet, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" target="_blank" title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" data-outlook-id="e969d9d8-afe5-4fde-99c7-3779cfebf110" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Randall J.

Of course, Alzheimer's is a complex disease, and there's no silver bullet treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474442225000249" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Lancet Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;are a little complicated and highly specific to a certain group of people. They also raise a lot of questions from experts about the potential impact of this treatment plan in the general population. Here’s what you should know, and what doctors think of the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Randall J.

In case you’re not familiar, amyloid is found, but in the brain it clumps together to form "plaques" between nerve cells. Too much build-up of these amyloid plaques in the brains can lead to issues with brain function and is linked to Alzheimer's, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). But we'll get to more of that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers gave the study participants an experimental anti-amyloid drug. They found that 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study's start and who took the drug the longest (an average of eight years) had a 50 percent lower chance of developing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the treatment cure Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t study the impact of the treatment on people who already have Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, they looked at people with a very high likelihood of developing it who were within 10 to 15 years before they were expected to develop the disease based on their family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the treatment is more geared towards delaying or halting onset rather than curing an existing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are amyloid plaques and what do they do in the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are areas where amyloid (again, a protein) has built up, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can think of it a lot like a scab on your skin,” he says. “The scab is rough, it isn't supposed to be there and, if it gets too thick, it causes a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is some debate about whether targeting amyloid will help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Targeting brain amyloid is not a slam dunk for Alzheimer’s prevention as we do not have any tests that are in use clinically to predict Alzheimer’s onset,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most neurologists liken [amyloid plaques] to skin freckles, which are normal aging phenomena and extremely infrequent[ly] became a skin cancer,” Dr. Segil continues. “Many Alzheimer’s scientists liken them to unexploded land mines which, if left alone, will cause older people to lose the ability to tie their shoes and all but surely get Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this treatment break down the amyloid plaques?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment uses anti-amyloid antibodies to break down the plaques, Dr. Sachdev explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anti-amyloid antibodies attach to amyloid and use the immune system to remove it,” he says. “This is very effective, because the immune system is excellent at getting rid of things that do not belong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Sachdev also says that the drug relies on inflammation to clear the plaques. (Think of it like this: Inflammation is a natural bodily response to kickstart healing in the body, bringing various cells and biological tools to the site of injury to repair it. The treatment seems to trigger inflammation.) “More than 50 percent of patients who were exposed in this study had changes to their brain [including potential for swelling and bleeding] that could be related to inflammation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, these medications come with the risk of brain bleeding, brain swelling, and brain shrinkage, making them risky to use, Dr. Segil points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this treatment be available to the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not yet, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Randall J.

"Our trial tested this in rare families with mutations that cause Alzheimer's disease," Dr. Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial originally ended in 2020.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-salt diets triggered depression-like behaviors in mice by activating specific immune cells that produce the inflammatory molecule IL-17A.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When researchers removed these immune cells or used mice genetically unable to produce IL-17A, the depression-like behaviors didn’t occur despite high salt consumption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While promising, this mouse study used extremely high salt levels, and more research is needed before applying these findings to human depression treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NANJING, China —&lt;/strong&gt; Too much salt has long been blamed for heart problems, but new research suggests it might harm our minds too. Scientists from Nanjing Medical University have discovered a surprising connection between high-salt diets and depression-like behaviors in mice, potentially explaining why depression rates continue rising alongside our consumption of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team found that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;excessive salt intake&lt;/a&gt; triggers specific immune responses in the brain that can lead to behaviors resembling depression. Their findings, published in &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkaf019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offer a biological explanation for previously observed connections between processed food consumption and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Depression&lt;/a&gt; affects millions worldwide, with lifetime prevalence reaching 15-18% in many populations. Modern Western diets, especially fast food, contain dramatically more sodium than home-cooked meals—sometimes exceeding homemade options by 100-fold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-salt-depression-connection"&gt;The Salt-Depression Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, mice fed high-salt diets showed behaviors remarkably similar to those experiencing chronic stress. They explored less, displayed heightened &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and spent more time motionless during tests measuring “behavioral despair”—patterns that parallel human depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated the biological mechanisms behind these behavioral changes. High-salt diets significantly increased production of Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), an immune signaling molecule, particularly in specialized immune cells called gamma delta T cells (γδT cells).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research had linked elevated IL-17A to depression, but this study reveals a direct pathway from dietary salt to increased IL-17A production to depression-like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm this connection, the team tested mice genetically modified to lack the ability to produce IL-17A. These mice showed no signs of depression despite consuming high-salt diets. Even more convincingly, when researchers removed the specific immune cells that produce IL-17A, the animals no longer developed depression-like behaviors on high-salt &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-salt-diet-weakens-immune-system-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-humans"&gt;What This Means for Humans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While conducted in mice, the research has compelling implications for human health. Population studies have already shown links between high-salt diets and increased depression rates. This study offers a potential explanation for those observations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/western-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;average American diet&lt;/a&gt; contains about 3,400 mg of sodium daily—far exceeding the American Heart Association’s recommended maximum of 2,300 mg. Fast food meals often deliver an entire day’s worth of recommended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sodium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; in a single sitting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first research connecting diet and mental health. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diets&lt;/a&gt; rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and lean proteins correlate with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-mediterranean-diet-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower depression rates&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, diets heavy in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, sugars, and unhealthy fats tend to increase depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinctive aspect of this study is identifying a specific biological pathway connecting diet directly to depression-like behaviors. This precision opens doors to potential new treatment approaches targeting the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-ways-to-reduce-salt-intake"&gt;Simple Ways To Reduce Salt Intake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current depression &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fish-oil-for-depression-stem-cell-study-shows-supplement-effective-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; typically focus on neurotransmitter imbalances using medications like SSRIs or on changing thought patterns through therapy. The discovery that dietary factors might contribute to depression through immune pathways represents an important shift in how we might approach mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applying these findings doesn’t necessarily require waiting for new pharmaceutical treatments. Simple dietary changes are accessible to most people:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing processed food intake&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eating more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/home-cooked-meals-healthy-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;home-cooked meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Checking food labels for sodium content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Using herbs and spices instead of salt for flavoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health professionals already recommend the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dash-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) for patients with high blood pressure. This diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and reduced sodium. This new research hints such approaches might benefit mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual choices, these findings could influence public health policies around sodium reduction in processed foods. Some countries have already implemented such regulations: the United Kingdom’s salt reduction program has achieved a 15% decrease in average salt intake since implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed before definitive conclusions about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;salt reduction&lt;/a&gt; as a depression treatment in humans, this study adds to mounting evidence that what we eat affects both body and mind. For those struggling with depression, these findings don’t suggest dietary changes should replace established treatments like therapy and medication, but they highlight diet as an important complementary factor in mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This research was conducted entirely in mice, not humans&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mouse depression models may not fully represent human depression’s complexity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The behavioral tests measure approximations of depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study used extremely high salt concentrations (8% in food, 1% in water)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This far exceeds even high-sodium human diets&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unclear if more moderate salt increases would produce similar effects&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only female mice were studied&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sex differences in immune response and depression are well-documented&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Results might differ in male subjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-correlation-vs-causation-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation vs. Causation Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study shows a pathway but doesn’t prove this is the only mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other factors beyond IL-17A may contribute to depression in high-salt scenarios&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The relationship may be more complex in humans with varied diets and lifestyles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-application-hurdles"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Application Hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No evidence yet that reducing salt intake reverses depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No human clinical trials testing this specific mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unknown if targeting this pathway would be effective in humans already experiencing depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used female C57BL/6J mice aged 8-12 weeks, including normal mice and some genetically modified to lack RORγt (a protein necessary for IL-17A production). Researchers split the mice into groups receiving either normal diet (0.5% salt) or high-salt diet (8% salt in food plus 1% salt in drinking water) for 5-8 weeks. They also included a group subjected to chronic restraint stress (placed in a restrictive tube for 4 hours daily for 3 weeks) as a comparison model known to induce depression-like behavior. To assess depression-like behaviors, researchers employed four behavioral tests: the open field test (measuring exploration and anxiety), elevated plus-maze test (measuring anxiety), and tail suspension and forced swimming tests (both measuring “giving up” behaviors). They then examined tissues from blood, spleen, and brain using flow cytometry and microscopy to identify changes in immune cells and IL-17A production. In some experiments, they depleted specific immune cells (γδT cells) using antibodies to see if this would prevent depression-like behavior in mice eating high-salt diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice on high-salt diets developed significant depression-like behaviors comparable to those seen in chronically stressed mice. They showed reduced exploration in open spaces, increased anxiety behaviors, and greater immobility (a sign of “giving up”) in behavioral tests. These changes happened without affecting blood pressure, body weight, or food intake, suggesting the effects weren’t due to physical health problems. High-salt diet increased IL-17A production in the spleen, blood, and brain. Further analysis showed γδT cells (specifically a subset called γδT17 cells) were the main source of this increased IL-17A. When genetically modified mice unable to produce IL-17A were fed high-salt diets, they didn’t develop depression-like behaviors. Similarly, depleting γδT cells in normal mice using antibodies protected them from developing depression-like behaviors despite consuming high-salt diets. These results strongly suggest high-salt diets trigger depression-like behaviors through IL-17A production by γδT cells.&lt;/p&gt;

DC Health is informing people who were at these locations that they may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listed below are the date, times, and locations of the potential exposure sites associated with this case of measles:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, a runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough. These symptoms usually start 7 to 14 days after being exposed. The second stage starts 3 to 5 days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should you do if you were at one of the above locations on the day and time specified?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People who might have been exposed and are not immune should contact their health care provider or DC Health at 844-493-2652 for more guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Anyone who was exposed and is at risk of developing measles should watch for symptoms until 21 days following the date of their last exposure. &lt;b&gt;If you notice the symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home and away from others.&lt;/b&gt; Contact your healthcare provider immediately. &lt;b&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/b&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the health department to help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve complete immunity, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you have an immunocompromising condition, please consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through a safe and effective MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are given to provide lifetime protection. However, infants younger than 12 months of age are too young to be vaccinated. These infants, and others who are not vaccinated, are very susceptible to infection if they are exposed to someone with measles. If you or your child have not yet been vaccinated, call DC Health or a healthcare provider to get the first of two doses as soon as possible. To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or contact DC Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers should maintain an increased index of suspicion for measles in clinically compatible cases at all times, especially if patients were recently exposed. Measles is an immediately reportable disease. Contact DC Health right away to report any suspected cases and arrange for public health testing. Suspected cases can be reported by healthcare providers via telephone at 844-493-2652 or by submitting a &lt;a href="https://dccovid.force.com/provider/s/login/?ec=302&amp;amp;startURL=%2Fprovider%2Fs%2F"&gt;Notifiable Disease and Condition Case Report Form online using the DC Reporting and Surveillance Center (DCRC), which can be found on our Infectious Diseases website &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning! It was quite a rainy day in Boston yesterday — but at least it wasn’t a cold one. I’m manifesting some sun for today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-picks-a-new-cdc-director"&gt;Trump picks a new CDC director&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/13/trump-administration-withdraws-dave-weldon-cdc-nomination/"&gt;chaotic withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; of his first nominee to lead the CDC, President Trump has selected the agency’s acting director, Susan Monarez, to take the role, STAT’s Sarah Owermohle and Helen Branswell report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monarez is a longtime biosecurity expert with ties to former President Biden’s flagship health initiative, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. If confirmed, she’ll be the first CDC director since 1953 not to be a doctor of medicine. While she wasn’t well-known before the news dropped yesterday, some that did know her apparently referred to her as “the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carrie-wolinetz-0631313_this-is-the-best-news-ive-had-the-privilege-activity-7018541444306976769-8ksK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kevin Bacon&lt;/a&gt; of biomedical innovation.” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/susan-monarez-trump-pick-cdc/"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-the-kidney-transplant-system-need-to-change"&gt;Does the kidney transplant system need to change?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study says yes — if the wait list for a kidney transplant were expanded to improve access, fundamental changes to the current model would be required to reduce or even maintain existing wait times. While there are about 90,000 people on the waitlist at any given time, per &lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal data&lt;/a&gt; from the fall, only about 25,000 kidney transplants take place each year. Adding 10% more patients to the waitlist would increase the average wait time by 4 months; adding 50% more patients would increase the time by almost two years. It would take an additional 2,800 kidneys to offset the 10% increase or 11,000 for a 50% increase, according to the analysis published yesterday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831868?guestAccessKey=45474923-36fb-4aa7-b7e0-15dd2eefd95f&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=032425" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, it’s especially difficult for people with kidney failure (the most sick patients) to get on the wait list for a transplant, and once there, it takes them &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/26/us/organ-transplants-waiting-list-skipped-patients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;longer&lt;/a&gt; to actually get a new kidney. But it’s not just the extreme cases that would benefit from more kidneys and shorter wait times — that could save lives across the board. Overall, large increases in kidneys from living donors are likely needed, as are research and policy initiatives that would promote it, the authors wrote. (They did not discuss xenotransplantation, which has received a lot of attention but is still in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/united-therapeutics-xenotransplantation-clinical-trial/"&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; of research.)  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nih-removes-outside-advisers-who-evaluate-research"&gt;NIH removes outside advisers who evaluate research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prominent outside scientists who help the NIH evaluate its internal research programs are being abruptly removed, according to five advisers whose positions were terminated and a recording of an internal meeting obtained by STAT’s Megan Molteni and Jason Mast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why this is happening. The advisers who spoke to STAT were not given a reason, and have yet to receive an official notification of termination from the NIH. “I asked where this order came from and nobody seemed to know,” one person said. Among those being terminated are people without U.S. citizenship, women, people from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and people who work in newly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/trump-dei-ban-banned-words-list-scrambles-research-nih-veterans-affairs/"&gt;taboo&lt;/a&gt; areas like diversity and equity. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/nih-outside-scientific-advisers-being-removed/"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hong/AP&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past 35 years, the U.S. has built up systems to support people living with dementia and their caregivers — often through programs that rely on Medicaid funding. But the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/upshot/trump-medicaid-tax-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proposed federal budget&lt;/a&gt; calls for $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years. If that happens, these programs that rely on Medicaid will likely need to reduce their services or potentially close down. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are afraid. I’m afraid. They are afraid of what will happen to them if they get this disease. They are even more afraid of how their families will cope,” Hilda Pridgeon, a founder of the Alzheimer’s Association, told Congress in 1990 while advocating for more support. In a new First Opinion essay, physician Jason Karlawish argues that this fear “will once again beset the American family” if the dramatic budget cuts are made. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/25/alzheimers-demetia-medicaid-services-support-pace-budget-cuts-caregivers/"&gt;Read the essay&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the stories of two patients from Karlawish’s memory clinic whose lives have been changed by Medicaid-funded programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-world-reduces-avoidable-deaths-amp-the-u-s-adds-them-study-says"&gt;The world reduces avoidable deaths &amp;amp; the U.S. adds them, study says&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most high-income countries around the world, the number of avoidable deaths (avoidable thanks to preventative measures or treatments) has been decreasing over the past decade. But in the U.S., that number is increasing, according to a study published yesterday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831735?guestAccessKey=6e140777-9347-46e6-bc5d-f78fca5cb2ee&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=032425" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2021, avoidable deaths in the U.S. increased from around 20 to 44 avoidable deaths per 100,000, the study found. The number of deaths increased in all 50 U.S. states, but the variation between each state also increased. Other countries saw about 14 fewer avoidable deaths per 100,000. In the European Union, the reduction was even greater, with an average of almost 24 fewer deaths per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. spends more on health care than every other high-income country, but the increase in avoidable deaths “suggests that there are concerning broad and systemic issues at play,” the study authors write. They write that policy solutions promoting healthy food, limiting exposure to harmful products, addressing gun violence, and regulating motor vehicle safety are potential ways to address the multifaceted problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-23andme-files-for-bankruptcy"&gt;23andMe files for bankruptcy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Late on Sunday, the DNA-testing startup 23andMe said it will file for bankruptcy and CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki will depart, after she repeatedly tried and failed to take the storied but financially troubled company private, STAT’s Jason Mast &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/23andme-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-anne-wojcicki-resigns/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; yesterday morning. The company will now try to sell itself through a court-supervised sale, and Wojcicki will continue trying to buy it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand how it all happened, STAT’s Matthew Herper cites Ernest Hemingway’s description of bankruptcy in the 1926 novel, “The Sun Also Rises”: It happens “two ways: Gradually, and then suddenly.” Bankruptcy is the worst outcome for both Wojcicki and the company’s shareholders, Matt writes. But it’s the customers that may suffer the most.

But it’s been hard to tell if the bowel movement issues came first or if the diseases caused them, given that the studies were in people who were already sick, says &lt;a href="https://www.moles.washington.edu/faculty/sean-gibbons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sean M. Gibbons, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sean M. Gibbons, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and associate professor at University of Washington’s Institute for Systems Biology. So, his study looked at people who were perfectly healthy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.moles.washington.edu/faculty/sean-gibbons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sean M. Gibbons, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sean M.

Here’s what the research found, plus what your own pooping schedule suggests about your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Reports Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed bowel movement and health data from 1,400 healthy adults and put them into four groups:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipated: one to two BMs a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-normal: three to six BMs a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-normal: one to three BMs a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhea: more than three bowel movements a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the researchers looked at the link between pooping frequency and a person’s gut microbiome. The researchers discovered that people in the high-normal group had higher levels of “good” bacteria in their guts than those who pooped less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people who were in the constipated group were more likely to have toxins in their blood that are linked to the development of serious conditions like kidney disease and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/memory/a60311866/why-its-so-important-to-detect-alzheimers-disease-early/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. On the flip side, people in the diarrhea group also had markers of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which can also raise the risk of developing certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the researchers concluded that bowel movement frequency could be an important indicator of future health issues. Still, Gibbons says that bowel movement frequency doesn’t come up enough in regular doctor’s visits. “We’re trying to change that and push doctors more toward managing this,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do doctors currently consider a “normal” pooping schedule?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current definition of a “normal” pooping schedule is really broad. Doctors &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17791-frequent-bowel-movements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generally;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; say that pooping anywhere from three times a day to three times a week falls into a normal range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a really wide range,” Gibbons says. “We suspected that there was a narrower range that might be optimal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might pooping a lot be bad for your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that happen in your body when you poop a lot. “People who have diarrhea tend to have higher levels of inflammation,” Gibbons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation in the body is linked to a slew of serious health complications and diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and neurogenerative diseases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (NIEHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people who poop a lot also had markers of liver stress. Gibbons says this “makes sense” given that the liver helps to produce bile, which is released into the intestines to break down fats and support digestion. “If we poop fast, we lose more of that bile, so it puts stress on our liver,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can pooping less be bad for you, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes down to what happens in your body before you poop. “Microbes in our guts prefer to ferment dietary fibers and turn them into organic acids,” Gibbons says. “They’re very good for our health and, if we’re under-exposed to them, we tend to have poorer outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if poop hangs out in your gut for too long, the microbes will eat any dietary fiber that’s there and then switch to protein fermentation, Gibbons says. “That leads to a bunch of toxic byproducts, and they have all been associated with chronic disease,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibbons points out that this study found these toxic byproducts in the system of slower poopers, even if they weren’t classified as being constipated. “We suspect that being exposed to them for longer periods of time could increase your lifetime risk of various chronic diseases,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is every other day to two bowel movements a day good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has to do with the above—pooping every other day to twice a day puts you in a sweet spot of not going too often or too little, Gibbons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But your pooping schedule tends to be a reflection of other things that are happening in your life, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bowel movements are often associated with a few features of a healthy lifestyle—greater amounts of vegetable and fruit intake, more exercise and more baseline daily activity, and good hydration,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein says that while your bowel movement frequency isn’t a traditional marker of health “it is becoming more apparent that gut health is critical to overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Bedford, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, agrees. “It’s all about the gut microbiome,” he says. “It impacts the digestive system, brain health...various aspects of your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to poop more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not pooping as much as you’d like, doctors recommend trying to do a few different things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going too little could be a sign that you are missing something—daily exercise, hydration, fiber from healthy plants and fruits,” Dr. Stein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors generally recommend that you see your healthcare provider when you have a change in your usual pooping habits. “If your frequency changes, if you have more than three bowel movements each day, if you have urgency or accidents or leakage, those are good reasons to check in with a provider,” Dr. Stein says. And, if you have any blood in your poop, she says that you shouldn’t hesitate to call your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have less than two bowel movements each week, or there is blood in the stool, weight loss, or you are straining a lot to get the stool out, talk with your physician about changes to your lifestyle and medications, and if you are in need for screening or evaluation for colon cancer,” Dr. Stein says. It’s also important to flag if you have a family history of Celiac disease or irritable bowel issues, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dr. Bedford says it’s important to speak up if you’re dealing with uncomfortable symptoms linked to your pooping habits, like bloating, gas, and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re within the “normal” range of pooping, Gibbons says there’s no need to worry about your bowel habits, unless they suddenly change. But if you find that constipation or diarrhea is a common issue for you, it’s important to get it checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:28:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1JOHZhWjRCZ0dhNF9SekkxazNkR0IzbWRROGlpRG4yMEJkY1FBeVFQaGxZYmFab3FCbnBwSlFVN0V4MnZadkJrZ3Q4TnFDSlNpcGdTVzBPd0IyS09FbjRCWlJySzNKQmNjZWtuQjBqWW9uX2lBZ0E</guid></item><item><title>DC Health officials confirmed measles case in the District - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWnhSWl9ZMHZrTUZVUHBWc2RqWGZNcklvSF9pNUhYNHdYTW1fMnZHeERlanFucV9YNXo1alhoOUJRRnQyQW1nWjZvYU1iSllTeC1ZTmNmX1FZY28zazlvbEdKU1daS3g2TU9Vd3VMOEVONWxVYnhBdmFPS055NkJwTmR5UDJfLTJnVlBuMzczTkZ3TEky?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;The D.C. Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed a positive case of measles in a person who visited various locations in the District while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The D.C. Department of Health confirmed Tuesday a positive case of measles in a person who visited various locations in the District while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unidentified person traveled throughout the nation’s capital within the last week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential exposure sites outlined by the District’s health department include two Amtrak locations and an urgent care location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Northeast Regional 175 Train Southbound
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 19, 7:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Concourse, Union Station, 50 Massachusetts Ave, NE
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 19, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MedStar Urgent Care Adams Morgan, 1805 Columbia Road, NW
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 22, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone not immune to measles and who traveled to the potential exposure sites during the noted dates and times are urged to contact their health care provider or DC Health at 844-493-2652 for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Health’s alert comes weeks after health officials in Maryland confirmed three measles cases across &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/measles-case-confirmed-in-howard-co-resident-who-passed-through-dulles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2025/03/2-more-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Prince George’s&lt;/a&gt; counties. All three cases had been contracted by residents who had traveled abroad, and were not related to the outbreaks in New Mexico, Texas or Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details surrounding the latest confirmed measles case have not yet been provided. It remains unclear whether international travel is at all linked to the D.C. case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measles case was previously reported in the District in &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2024/07/single-case-of-measles-confirmed-in-dc-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;July 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="p1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the measles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air when an infected individual breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;More than often appearing in two stages, symptoms don’t typically begin to show until after the seventh day that the virus was contracted. Symptoms range from high fevers, runny nose, watery eyes to tiny white spots that appear in one’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the measles rash makes up the second stage of symptoms, appearing on the face along the  hairline before spreading throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC explainer&lt;/a&gt; indicates that “if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.” It notes the best protection against the virus is the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, better known as the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Researchers define "healthy aging" as making it to age 70 without major chronic disease. Believe it or not, this is not entirely out of your hands. A new 30-year study tracking the eating habits of 105,015 middle-aged health professionals in the US finds diets high in plant-based foods with low to moderate amounts of animal-based foods and minimal ultra-processed foods had a higher likelihood of healthy aging independent of body mass index, physical activity, and smoking habits. "This suggests what you eat in midlife can play a big role in how well you age," University of Montreal nutrition researcher Anne-Julie Tessier, lead author of the study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/24/healthy-diet-harvard-study/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

                                        Most older adults have at least one chronic health condition, such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. Just 9,771 study participants (9.3%) reached the age of 70 without one. Their self-reported diets tended to highly adhere to one of eight healthy diets—the Mediterranean diet, the Planetary Health Diet Index, and the &lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/health/article/what-is-harvards-alternative-healthy-eating-index-ahei-where-does-your-meal-rank/857745"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt; (AHEI) among them, per the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/anti-ageing-diet-alternative-healthy-eating-ahei"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. These emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, and nuts and legumes, with low amounts of processed meat, sugars, and trans fat. Participants who scored the highest on the AHEI, specifically developed to prevent chronic disease, had an 86% greater likelihood of healthy aging compared with participants with the lowest scores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-eating-reach-70-no-chronic-disease-study-rcna197811"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports.

                                        Diets higher in red and processed meat, trans fats, sodium, and sugary beverages were linked to a lower likelihood of healthy aging. Participants who consumed the most ultra-processed foods were 32% less likely to achieve healthy aging, per the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;. "Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may enhance overall healthy aging, guiding future dietary guidelines," reads the observational study. This may be of interest to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's linked rising rates of chronic disease with processed food, per NBC.

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the system achieved 98% accuracy in differentiating between MSA and PSP, with diagnoses confirmed in about 94% of post-mortem brain analyses, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250318880785/en/JAMA-Neurology-publishes-landmark-study-showing-neuropacs-AI-technology-significantly-enhances-the-diagnostic-accuracy-of-Parkinsons-disease-and-atypical-parkinsonism"&gt;Neuropacs press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an important milestone for the parkinsonism community, including clinical providers and, most importantly, patients,” said David Vaillancourt, PhD, Neuropacs’ cofounder and chief scientific officer, a professor at the University of Florida, and the principal investigator of the study. The work was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We anticipate that the Neuropacs AI technology will revolutionize the current standard of care for diagnosing parkinsonism and will have far-reaching impacts on clinical care and clinical trial testing of new therapeutics,” Vaillancourt said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831631"&gt;Automated Imaging Differentiation for Parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Symptoms of atypical parkinsonism often similar to Parkinson’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/atypical-parkinsonism/"&gt;Atypical parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt; refers to conditions that cause symptoms closely resembling those of Parkinson’s — which can make a diagnosis challenging even for the most experienced clinician. It is estimated that as many as 45% of patients initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s are later found to have another type of parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, there is a need to develop clinical biomarkers that can help guide clinicians in reaching a more specific diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, scientists assessed Neuropacs’ AI technology in 249 patients at 21 &lt;a href="https://parkinson-study-group.org/"&gt;Parkinson Study Group&lt;/a&gt; centers — 19 in the U.S. and two in Canada. The patients had a mean age of 67.8, and were mainly men (62%). Based on a consensus clinical diagnosis from three independent neurologists, 99 patients in the study were diagnosed with Parkinson’s, 97 with PSP, and 53 with MSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, which captures images based on the movement of water molecules within tissues, was performed on patients and analyzed using Neuropacs’ AI software to predict each individual’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than three-quarters of the patients (78%) were placed in a training set to help the AI algorithm learn to differentiate between these types of conditions. The remaining 22% were assigned to a testing set to evaluate the model’s accuracy in diagnosing the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Patient autopsy data confirmed AI model diagnosis in 94% of cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, the model demonstrated a strong accuracy in distinguishing between different conditions, achieving accuracy of 96% in differentiating Parkinson’s from atypical parkinsonism. When distinguishing MSA from PSP, accuracy reached 98%. Similarly, it was 98% accurate in differentiating Parkinson’s from MSA and Parkinson’s from PSP, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers further confirmed the model predictions by analyzing brain tissue obtained from 49 patient autopsies, with about three years separating the last imaging scan and the individual’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis predicted by the AI model was confirmed in 46 of these patients (94%), including in all participants with Parkinson’s or MSA (five patients each), and 36 of 39 individuals with PSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represented a 12.3% gain in obtaining a correct diagnosis compared with a diagnosis based on clinical criteria, the researchers noted. Using clinical criteria, 82% of the patients were correctly diagnosed — four of five with Parkinson’s, three of five with MSA, and 33 of the 39 with PSP, according to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The age of using data-driven tools like AI to diagnose Parkinson’s and other neurological conditions has arrived. … As clinicians, we must embrace these technologies and start considering how we can best integrate them into routine workflows for neurological care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The findings highlight the transformative potential of this diagnostic software in clinical practice,” said Michael Okun, MD, codirector of the Norman Fixel Institute at the University of Florida, one of the sites that contributed to the study. Okun also serves as medical advisor for the &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/"&gt;Parkinson’s Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and is a member of Neuropacs’ clinical advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The age of using data-driven tools like AI to diagnose Parkinson’s and other neurological conditions has arrived,” Okun said. “As clinicians, we must embrace these technologies and start considering how we can best integrate them into routine workflows for neurological care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristophe Diaz, PhD, executive director and chief science officer of &lt;a href="https://www.psp.org/"&gt;CurePSP&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based nonprofit, noted that “proper diagnosis of PSP remains a critical need,” to ensure patients receive the correct treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The results of this study are exciting progress [toward] a noninvasive and clinically scalable solution to help improve diagnosis,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers tracked rats’ hippocampal neuron activity for up to 20 hours and found that memory patterns first echoed the learning phase and then gradually shifted to match the recollection phase upon waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reorganization, observed during non-REM sleep, involved a dynamic change in the neurons representing reward locations—some stopped firing while others became active. These changes not only reinforced the memory but may also free up neurons for storing new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-REM Sleep Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory reactivation and optimization occurred during non-REM sleep, while REM sleep seemed to counteract this effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representational Drift:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuronal activity shifted from mimicking the learning phase to the recall phase, helping refine memory storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; After sleep, fewer neurons were involved in recalling reward locations, suggesting an optimization of memory representation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good night’s sleep helps us remember recently learned information, ‘engraving’ our memories. This is also true for animals, as remembering for example the location of food resources is essential for their survival. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists can examine this role of sleep in the lab by training lab mice or rats about their environment using various memory tasks. In such experiments designed for spatial learning, the animals must learn and subsequently remember the location of food rewards in mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive research aimed at understanding the neuronal mechanisms that favor learning, memory formation, and recollection, many questions about these essential brain functions remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from Professor Jozsef Csicsvari’s group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have probed the key roles of sleep stages in optimizing memory recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wirelessly measured neuronal activity patterns in rat brains for up to 20 hours of sleep, considerably extending previously reported measurement times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the neuronal assemblies in the early stages of sleep reflect recently learned spatial memories. However, as sleep progresses, neuronal activity patterns gradually transform into those seen later, when the rats awaken and remember the locations of their food rewards,” says Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping—and remembering—reward locations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past work showed that a cortical brain area called the hippocampus is important both for exploring and maintaining routes in an environment (called spatial navigation), and for spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal neurons keep track of the animal’s location by firing at specific locations, thus forming a cognitive map of the environment. Animals use this map to navigate in space while updating it during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this process, the reward locations play an instrumental role, becoming disproportionately represented on the animals’ cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following spatial learning, the hippocampus plays an important role in enhancing memory during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does so by reactivating recently learned memory traces. Previously, the Csicsvari group showed that the more often a specific reward location is reactivated during sleep, the better the animal remembered that location when they woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when the team blocked the reactivation of a specific reward memory, the animals were unable to recall the respective location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reorganizing neuronal patterns during sleep engraves memories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists could so far only examine the reactivation of spatial memories in shorter sleep periods of two to four hours, the team now achieved such experiments during long overnight sleep. Using wireless recordings, they monitored neuronal activity in the hippocampus for up to 20 hours while the rats rested and slept after a spatial learning paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings were unexpected. We showed that the activity patterns of neurons linked to the reward locations reorganized during the long sleep,” says ISTA PhD graduate Lars Bollmann, one of the study’s co-first authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when a given reward location was reactivated, not all the neurons that represented that location remained active in the entire sleep. While some did—the ISTA researchers called them a “stable subgroup”—, others stopped firing during later sleep stages. But at the same time, a new group of neurons started to fire gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most surprisingly, we showed that while the pattern of firing neurons in the early stages of sleep echoed the neuronal activity in the learning phase, this pattern later evolved to mirror the neuronal activity when the rats woke up and remembered where the rewards were located,” adds Bollmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the team not only observed a drift in neuronal activity patterns during sleep in the frame of spatial learning but also linked it to the process of memory reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, they shed light on how sleep helps keep memories fresh. In addition, they showed that this reorganization happens during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, while REM sleep counteracts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freeing neurons up for new memories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could be the role of this phenomenon—called “representational drift”—that occurs in sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can only speculate in this regard,” says Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible that memory representations must be formed quickly during learning but that such representations are not optimal for long-term storage. Therefore, a process may take place in sleep that optimizes these representations in sleep to reduce brain resources to store a specific memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of this hypothesis, the researchers observed that fewer neurons were linked to a given reward location after sleep than before. Therefore, some neurons get freed up to take in newer memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any new memories must find a way to be integrated into existing knowledge. Frequent repetitions of the new memories as well as partial change in the neuronal code may thus help optimize their integration into existing memory representations,” concludes Csicsvari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present research was conducted at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) by the recent ISTA PhD graduate Lars Bollmann and former ISTA postdoc Peter Baracskay (co-first authors) together with former ISTA postdoc Federico Stella, currently an Assistant Professor at Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, The Netherlands, and ISTA Professor Jozsef Csicsvari (co-corresponding authors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cbaaa5afb9aeaab8e5b9a4bfa3ae8ba2b8bfe5aaa8e5aabf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Andreas Rothe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ist.ac.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Andreas Rothe – IST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep stages antagonistically modulate reactivation drift&lt;/a&gt;” by Jozsef Csicsvari et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep stages antagonistically modulate reactivation drift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal reactivation of waking neuronal assemblies in sleep is a key initial step of systems consolidation. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether reactivated assemblies are static or whether they reorganize gradually over prolonged sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tracked reactivated CA1 assembly patterns over ∼20 h of sleep/rest periods and related them to assemblies seen before or after in a spatial learning paradigm using rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that reactivated assembly patterns were gradually transformed and started to resemble those seen in the subsequent recall session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) had antagonistic roles: whereas NREM accelerated the assembly drift, REM countered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, only a subset of rate-changing pyramidal cells contributed to the drift, whereas stable-firing-rate cells maintained unaltered reactivation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that prolonged sleep promotes the spontaneous reorganization of spatial assemblies, which can contribute to daily cognitive map changes or encoding new learning situations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:55:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFAxd0Z6aC1QS1lGSlFDUkN2NFMyYXRjTk1zRUpCSXhVVzc3N19BeXpWWEtqMmZubVlFVFo2bUotb3UxaHZXcjRhS1dZZkZMa3ZYWFVBQjB1RFpwUHllc3JuYllaeU1wdUUyazlHVzl3</guid></item><item><title>On ‘Diabetes Alert Day,’ 80% of people unaware of condition that could help prevent serious health problems - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3AFBVV95cUxOdTFtdEF2Z3J3YUFQeFZETV84eDBVcjg3NTBWSEsxVmg3VkdsSkFvOHJUNFdzSC1xNExDRnVDY2s0dkFmV3pZeEpzNHF3ODE1eWc5VXltaVUtOTJJQ1N2TlU5dF9QOXVpUjZwNE5qQ2V5Z2N3WU5qSF8xV25tTzRyT0ZtZS05bTNvSzdER2FObzFZWFpZZlNvS3g4My1yN0RUMm54Ql9vNFp2MDN2bGEyUlNZUzZzTUpObzV2X0dqcjVLVm44Z181S241dERIblFNdmxETldza1hCOFFa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Each year, the fourth Tuesday of March marks Diabetes Alert Day, a day meant to sound the alarm on the prevalence and risks linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a disease where a person’s body can’t regulate sugar properly. Over time it can lead to serious health complications, including heart attack, stroke, vision loss, kidney problems and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, the fourth Tuesday of March is&lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Diabetes Alert Day&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s several types of diabetes, but the most common one is Type 2 diabetes, which develops over time,” said&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/kwameakoto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Dr. Kwame Akoto&lt;/a&gt;, an internal medicine physician at Kaiser Permanente. As for what contributes to diabetes, the keys are aging, family history and genetics, diet and fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, as researchers have learned more about how diabetes progresses, as well as treatment and prevention, doctors have sought ways to prevent patients from developing Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, what we see is people go from normal sugars to what’s called prediabetes,” said Akoto. “And this is when your body starts to have those first triggers of sugar intolerance, and then the process worsens from there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the American Diabetes Association &lt;a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-extlink=""&gt;first introduced the diagnostic criteria&lt;/a&gt; for prediabetes to determine the likelihood of someone developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, prediabetes has no symptoms,” said Akoto. “According to the CDC, about 38% of American adults — which is about 96 million people — have prediabetes, and we think about 80% don’t know that they have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the District of Columbia, approximately 3,000 adults each year are diagnosed with diabetes, he said. In Maryland, approximately 28,000 receive the diagnose each year, and in Virginia, approximately 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How to identify prediabetes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In prediabetes, a person’s blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/prediabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. Preventive Task Force, which makes guidelines for us to implement screening with our patients, did recommend for adults between the ages of 35 to 70 who are overweight or obese should be screened at their visits,” said Akoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory screening involves a blood draw — including a fasting plasma glucose test, which measures blood sugar after an overnight fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The one you’ll most likely see is called a Hemoglobin A1c test, which is a sugar average test that’s looking at your average sugar over eight to 12 weeks,” said Akoto. “That’s probably the one you’ll see most commonly used now, because it gives us so much information, instead of that spot test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lifestyle changes can prevent diabetes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a prediabetes diagnosis doesn’t mean a patient will develop diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle changes are really important,” said Akoto. “With controlling body weight, we do see research shows that 5% to 7% of body weight loss will reduce your risk of diabetes by 58%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding exercise activities such as walking, using a treadmill, bike riding or resistance training is important in heading off diabetes. “We recommend 150 minutes a week, split up any way that you like,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet should include more fruits and vegetables, said Akoto. “These are high fiber foods that slow down how the sugar absorbs in our gut. Lean proteins also have the same effect, so incorporate things like fish, or turkey or chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike traditional brain scans taken during rest, this immersive approach revealed distinct patterns of neural communication in ADHD, especially in deeper brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that ADHD-related brain differences become more visible during real-world-like interactions, highlighting the need for more dynamic diagnostic methods. These findings could pave the way for improved diagnostics and non-drug treatments using gamified tools and real-time brain tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VR Brain Imaging:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD-related brain differences were only apparent during active virtual gameplay, not rest or passive video viewing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inter-Regional Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; The study found altered communication between deep brain structures and cortical areas in children with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Results suggest ADHD diagnostics and research should involve real-world tasks to better capture symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Aalto University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a novel study, researchers from several European universities used Virtual Reality gaming to study brain network activity in children with clinically diagnosed ADHD. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, ADHD in both children and adults has primarily been studied using brain imaging in a resting state, rather than while actively engaging in tasks where overt symptoms are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Taking pictures of the brain while memory and attention are being loaded in a virtual world gives us a deeper understanding of what’s going on,’ explains Juha Salmitaival (aka Salmi), visiting professor at Aalto University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108229"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child in a VR headset and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/vr-adhd-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Similarly, the virtual world contains toys that can trigger impulsivity, like musical instruments, a soft drink in the fridge or the chance to take a virtual shower. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘During the virtual reality game, there were clear differences in brain network activation for kids with ADHD, particularly in the deep structures of the brain and their connection to cortical areas.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning, subjects were immersed in a world of challenges mimicking those faced by people in the real world. The game was projected onto a mirror, allowing children to play whilst their brain activity was scanned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were then compared with scans taken while they were doing more passive activities like watching a video or simply resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Interestingly, while at rest, there was no detectable difference between the groups, and there was little difference during video viewing,’ says Salmi, findings which also highlight the value of this novel way of collecting neuroimaging data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We used to think that abnormal development is mostly a matter of background activity in specific, limited brain regions. But these findings indicate that it’s more to do with inter-regional communication between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We found that alterations in brain activity in individuals with ADHD are driven by the human-environment interaction,’ says Salmi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that psychological testing for ADHD in the clinic, or even just brain imaging research more generally, should take place in situations where the individual is actually doing something that would spark symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmi hopes the study will spark more extensive research, believing that this method could also help us find out what’s behind the sharp rise in ADHD diagnoses and in the development of non-pharmacological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games and apps are changing our brains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not lost on the researchers that gaming in a virtual environment is an excellent way to explore what’s going on in our brains in a world of screens and social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The brain is a complex system that always tries to adapt to its environment, therefore it’s likely being shaped by TikTok, Snapchat and other apps and games as well,’ says Salmi. Similarly, the virtual world contains toys that can trigger impulsivity, like musical instruments, a soft drink in the fridge or the chance to take a virtual shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘If the environment is fast paced, with people jumping from one thing to another like a grasshopper, the brain tries to get better at jumping from one stimulus to another,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘But if we become grasshoppers, we can no longer concentrate for two hours when there are very few stimuli. Scanning the brain while it’s active could also give us fresh insight into how our brains are changing.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies for the team include researching children’s brains using smart suits and motion sensors, as well as exploring symptoms in adults in set ups that more closely simulate daily life. He foresees that in the future, symptoms could also be quantified at home, for example using augmented reality glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmi also points out that while fMRI is at this stage too costly to be used for mainstream diagnostic purposes, as we build more knowledge in this way, diagnosing neuropsychiatric conditions should also become more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Aalto researchers, the study involved researchers from HUS, the University of Helsinki, the University of Oulu and the Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre in France. The virtual game, Epeli was developed by a Finnish company called Peili Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ADHD and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99eaf8ebf8f1b7f1ecfdeaf6f7d9f8f8f5edf6b7fff0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sarah Hudson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aalto.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aalto University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sarah Hudson – Aalto University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Real-world goal-directed behavior reveals aberrant functional brain connectivity in children with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;” by Juha Salmitaival et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-world goal-directed behavior reveals aberrant functional brain connectivity in children with ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional connectomics is a popular approach to investigate the neural underpinnings of developmental disorders of which attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, neuronal mechanisms driving the aberrant functional connectivity resulting in ADHD symptoms remain largely unclear. Whereas resting state activity reflecting intrinsic tonic background activity is only vaguely connected to behavioral effects, naturalistic neuroscience has provided means to measure phasic brain dynamics associated with overt manifestation of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in three experimental conditions, an active virtual reality (VR) task where the participants execute goal-directed behaviors, a passive naturalistic Video Viewing task, and a standard Resting State condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine children with ADHD and thirty-seven typically developing (TD) children participated in this preregistered study. Functional connectivity was examined with network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical metrics. During the naturalistic VR task, the ADHD group showed weaker task performance and stronger functional connectivity than the TD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group differences in functional connectivity were observed in widespread brain networks: particularly subcortical areas showed hyperconnectivity in ADHD. More restricted group differences in functional connectivity were observed during the Video Viewing, and there were no group differences in functional connectivity in the Resting State condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations were consistent across NBS and graph theoretical analyses, although NBS revealed more pronounced group differences. Furthermore, during the VR task and Video Viewing, functional connectivity in TD controls was associated with task performance during the measurement, while Resting State activity in TD controls was correlated with ADHD symptoms rated over six months. We conclude that overt expression of the symptoms is correlated with aberrant brain connectivity in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, naturalistic paradigms where clinical markers can be coupled with simultaneously occurring brain activity may further increase the interpretability of psychiatric neuroimaging findings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:23:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1TTmRrSXVnRW1uT2pUblhSblJEUUFSWmdhd2NpVWpQRVNIOXMxX2VNcnZaQXU5Z1JadkRSMC1kLS1pMTRRX1dPT2ZEcU9qbjc2d2JaNU1MaTR3ZU1xUTNGSUJfWU90c0ljY2tCVw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover How To Flip the Immune “Switch” Against Alzheimer’s Disease - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOalJaUGlDQkszSEdNd3dQUnlUdzRBRVh0NTdmUDlkbmpVOVpGR2REMjFOS2I1M2l5REVCQ2FiR0ZKTDhxYk01T280aU9Cbkd2TFFyOU1vdTVHZnBZS094cWZVbzRRZGY4cER3ZDN4MThEdnFYRm9HOUowYl94eWNyTWRmdENLT3UxUURhMndGaUcyandkVFJ1eTRlbG1uSHQ4RXdEMw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:12:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOalJaUGlDQkszSEdNd3dQUnlUdzRBRVh0NTdmUDlkbmpVOVpGR2REMjFOS2I1M2l5REVCQ2FiR0ZKTDhxYk01T280aU9Cbkd2TFFyOU1vdTVHZnBZS094cWZVbzRRZGY4cER3ZDN4MThEdnFYRm9HOUowYl94eWNyTWRmdENLT3UxUURhMndGaUcyandkVFJ1eTRlbG1uSHQ4RXdEMw</guid></item></channel></rss>
