If you're struggling to remember things because of strain on your brain's cognitive abilities or even finding it hard to cope with motions, of course evidence of that will show up in every aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From your home decor and clutter to the state of your car, little things can be an example of a person's internal dysregulation. Even bags and bags of clutter or clothing piles can be a red flag, and if you notice these things in someone's car, they're likely under serious stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 things in someone's car, they're likely under serious stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

Healthy food habits and eating often protect both physical and mental health, which is why balanced meals are so important for resting and coping with stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice piles of takeout containers in someone's car, they're likely under serious stress. It's not just about comfort or convenience — although those are often self-soothing habits for stress — but general health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/exhausted-all-time-might-be-because-you-carry-these-invisible-responsibilities"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You're Exhausted All The Time, It Might Be Because You Carry These 11 Invisible Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084081"&gt;Millions of people&lt;/a&gt; around the world live with wounds that simply won't heal. These long-lasting wounds, often caused by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, poor circulation or pressure, can be painful, prone to infection and can seriously affect &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045253"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt;. In severe cases, they can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2022.110194"&gt;lead to amputation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments help manage symptoms, but they don't always address the underlying problem. That means dressings, antibiotics and repeated clinic visits, often for months or years. For many people, that cycle never truly ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest research published by my colleagues and myself &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503308122"&gt;offers a new perspective&lt;/a&gt; on why some wounds just won't heal – and points to a potential new way of treating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/injured-cells-can-vomit-waste-to-boost-healing-study-finds"&gt;Injured Cells Can 'Vomit' Waste to Boost Healing, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying both human tissue and experimental models, we found that a molecule in the skin called MC1R is consistently disrupted in chronic wounds. When we stimulated this molecule, the skin was able to reduce inflammation and begin healing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MC1R is best known for something quite different from wound healing: the gene is responsible for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1195-328"&gt;red hair and very fair skin&lt;/a&gt;. But MC1R does far more than influence pigment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MC1R is found on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503308122"&gt;many different types of skin cells&lt;/a&gt;, including immune cells, keratinocytes (the cells that form the outer layer of the skin), fibroblasts (the cells that make scar tissue) and the cells that line blood vessels. This means MC1R can influence several parts of the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183035" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/layers_of_skin_642.jpg" alt="diagram of layers of skin" class="wp-image-183035 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/layers_of_skin_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/layers_of_skin_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183035" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;MC1R is found in a variety of skin tissues. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADmTPeRmHc/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healing process is more complex than simply "closing" a wound. The skin first triggers inflammation (the body's early defence response that removes microbes and damaged tissue), then gradually turns that inflammation off to allow repair. When that switch-off fails, wounds can remain inflamed for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because MC1R has known &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1078678"&gt;anti-inflammatory roles&lt;/a&gt; in other conditions such as arthritis, we wanted to know whether its behaviour might also help explain why chronic wounds fail to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this, we used two complementary approaches. First, we analysed human tissue samples from three major types of chronic wounds: diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and pressure ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having different causes, these wounds showed a similar problem: the mechanism that normally helps calm inflammation was disrupted. Both MC1R and its natural partner molecule, POMC, were also out of balance – and this imbalance was present across all wound types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we used experimental models to understand how this disruption affects healing. We examined mice that carry a non-functional version of MC1R. These animals developed wounds that were slow to heal and showed some of the same features we see in human chronic wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their wounds contained many inflammatory immune cells and abundant "neutrophil extracellular traps" – sticky webs of DNA and proteins that, when they persist, are associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-04294-3"&gt;ongoing inflammation and delayed repair&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183040" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183040" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_clot_642.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-183040 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_clot_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_clot_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183040" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Magnified image of a blood clot, with trapped red and white cells. (Micro Discovery/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better replicate human chronic wounds, we also created a new mouse model that produces slow-healing, inflammation-rich ulcers. This allowed us to test potential treatments in conditions that closely mimic human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we applied a topical drug that selectively activates MC1R, healing improved dramatically. The ulcers produced less exudate (the fluid that often leaks from chronic wounds), blood-vessel growth increased (improving the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the wound bed) and the outer layer of skin began to recover and close over the wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, activating MC1R reduced neutrophil extracellular traps and limited the arrival of new inflammatory cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also applied the drug to a small cut on healthy animals. Stimulating MC1R further boosted blood flow, improved lymphatic drainage and reduced scarring. This suggests MC1R supports healing not only when wounds are stuck, but also under normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings indicate that MC1R plays a meaningful role in coordinating several key aspects of skin repair. When the pathway is disrupted, inflammation persists. When MC1R is activated, that inflammation can resolve and allow other healing processes to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healing chronic wounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic wounds affect millions of people – and the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/wound.2023.0150"&gt;numbers are rising&lt;/a&gt; alongside global rates of diabetes, ageing and obesity. They're also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045253"&gt;extremely costly&lt;/a&gt; for healthcare systems. Even small improvements in healing could make a significant difference to patients and reduce strain on services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings raise the possibility of new treatments that target MC1R to help the skin move out of a chronic inflammatory state. Because we saw positive effects with a topical application, future therapies might take the form of ointments or gels that patients could apply themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed, identifying MC1R as a key pathway disrupted in chronic wounds gives us a clearer understanding of why some wounds fail to heal – and offers hope for finding new ways to help the skin repair itself.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268915/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

Strong currents rush around its edges, but inside the ring, the surface settles into long, smooth swells. This region has no coastline or islands, yet it has a name: the Sargasso Sea, a part of the ocean that behaves differently from the water around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the surface, golden‑brown seaweed called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sargassum-seaweed-is-a-deadly-obstacle-course-for-baby-sea-turtles/"&gt;Sargassum&lt;/a&gt; gathers into loose mats. Tiny gas‑filled bladders keep the seaweed afloat, so it rides the waves instead of sinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shrimp, bright juvenile fish, pale crabs, and many other creatures move through this tangle, using it as food, shelter, or both. The Sargasso Sea is the only sea named after a plant rather than a coastline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sargasso-sea-sailor-stories"&gt;Sargasso Sea sailor stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before satellites or ocean sensors, sailors noticed this unusual water. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt; described the fear of being becalmed in 1492 when he wrote that the ships might “never again feel a breath of wind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crews did not know that the calm surface hid a powerful system of currents below. They were sailing across the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Gyre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;North Atlantic subtropical gyre&lt;/a&gt; – a huge loop of water that draws in water from many latitudes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These currents corral floating material and keep it in place. That pattern helps explain why Sargassum gathers here and why this sea has such a distinct character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sargasso-sea-plants-and-animals"&gt;Sargasso Sea plants and animals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From above, the Sargasso Sea looks like an 800-mile-wide &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sargassosea.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant nursery&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists call the drifting mats “habitat islands” because the seaweed provides shade, hiding places, and food sources all in one package at the ocean surface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many animals that would otherwise be exposed in the open water can tuck into this cover and avoid predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/porbeagle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Porbeagle sharks&lt;/a&gt; cruise along the dim edges of the mats, while Bermuda storm‑petrels sweep just above the water, grabbing shrimp and small fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys have counted more than 100 invertebrate species clinging to Sargassum, living their entire lives on these drifting clumps until the mats finally break apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European and American eels begin their lives beneath &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sargassum-seaweed-a-growing-problem-could-become-a-sustainable-solution/"&gt;Sargassum&lt;/a&gt; mats as transparent larvae. They ride the ocean currents westward or eastward, depending on the species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, they grow, change shape, and slip into rivers that can reach as far inland as Indiana, where they may live for decades in freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they reach maturity, these eels swim back out to sea and make the 3,000‑mile journey to the Sargasso Sea to spawn once and die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They return to the same broad region where they started, even though there are no obvious visual landmarks to guide them. This ability still puzzles zoologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-patch-and-climate"&gt;Calm patch and climate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sargasso Sea is also plays a part in Earth’s climate system. In summer, the surface warms to about 82–86 °F; in winter, it cools to roughly 64–68 °F. Warm, salty water moves northward, while cooler water returns south. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exchange helps steady weather patterns on both sides of the Atlantic by shaping how heat and moisture move through the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open water also absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plankton-change-their-cell-chemistry-to-survive-warming-oceans/"&gt;tiny plankton&lt;/a&gt; use that carbon to build shells. When they die, many of those shells sink to the seafloor, carrying the carbon with them and keeping it out of the atmosphere for long periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 1950s, researchers near Bermuda have recorded conditions in these waters. The long record shows that, since the 1980s, the average temperature here has climbed by roughly 1 °C, or about 1.8 °F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer surface layers resist vertical mixing, so oxygen has a harder time reaching depth, and nutrients from below do not rise as easily to feed plankton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measurements, combined with data from drifting Argo floats and satellite color scans, make the Sargasso Sea a key site for studying ocean acidification in the open Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-atlantic-ocean-fish-trap"&gt;Atlantic Ocean fish trap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sargasso Sea sits at the center of several major surface currents, so today this calm region collects floating debris from across the North Atlantic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These looping flows pull in plastic bags, bottle caps, and abandoned fishing gear and hold them in the rotating water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One survey estimated roughly 200,000 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/great-pacific-garbage-patch-so-large-that-dozens-of-species-call-it-home/"&gt;pieces of debris&lt;/a&gt; per square kilometer – about 518,000 pieces per square mile – spread over several hundred miles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underwater microphones pick up the growl of cargo vessels as they cut straight through Sargassum mats. That noise can mask the low‑frequency calls of sperm whales passing beneath, and floating nets tangled in the weed can trap juvenile turtles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/28130808/sargasso-sea_bermuda-triangle_map_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/28130814/sargasso-sea_bermuda-triangle_map_1s.webp" alt="Location map of the island of Bermuda and the Sargasso Sea.

If the Sargasso Sea lost its special conditions, rivers from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico would send eels to the ocean only for them to search in vain for a birthplace erased by heat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humpback whales might arrive in spring to find feeding areas stripped of their usual prey. Storm tracks over Europe could shift, and the Atlantic might store even more of the planet’s excess heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For something that looks like an empty patch of blue on a map, the Sargasso Sea plays a large role in Earth’s climate and marine life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The still water sends a clear message: we need to protect this calm region, or be prepared for more intense and less predictable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1289931/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Marine Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 22:14:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxObC1penhESHVKbVlmM0NwTng0elMxLWMtZ21KaTBrV3hzSzR0R1RyZ0x3YTNVNnZlNU9pN01Jdm5ZWW9jSy1VS1F3Y0lCa1BKVXBXakVpTGt0SFNwVDkwYXdCY2RCbnc5d2RUeks4NS0wZm96YmdJS0wyblJtV0pRUERWRGFBdkpVMXp3d0FlUEZkSXhmOGc2Sjl2ZGJ0c0ZMdXFvRQ</guid></item><item><title>Louise Newson博士：真正令人不安的是对女性的伤害-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/dr-louise-newson-menopause-clinic-panorama-pgpxpctdl</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Louise Newson is in a glum mood when we first meet. She came to London for a BBC &lt;i&gt;Woman’s Hour&lt;/i&gt; interview about research she had funded into potential links between the menopause, depression and suicide, but is early for our rendezvous, having been pulled from the programme at the last minute. “I’ve come to expect it,” she says. “It’s disheartening, but not surprising.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Until recently Newson, one of the country’s best known menopause experts, was a fixture in the media. She had a regular slot on &lt;i&gt;This Morning&lt;/i&gt;, and her free Balance app had more than a million downloads. Now, after what she calls an “annus horribilis” in which &lt;i&gt;Panorama&lt;/i&gt; accused Newson’s private clinic of increasing the cancer risk to patients by prescribing&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; high dosages of hormones, and a timely leak that the leading professional body for menopause medics had stripped her of specialist status, Newson’s reputation has taken a severe dent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson Health, her private practice, which has two centres in Stratford-upon-Avon and London, had been seeing about 4,000 patients a month but that figure slumped. She had to make 26 out of 70 doctors redundant, and slash the amount of menopause research she was able to fund. A pending professorship at a university was dropped, most of her media appearances were cancelled, and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) announced an inspection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/dr-louise-newson-tells-of-menopause-witch-hunt-9fzmmr38r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr Louise Newson tells of ‘menopause witch-hunt’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I have been to some very dark places,” Newson confesses while sipping chamomile tea in an upmarket bar off Chancery Lane in central London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It has been very difficult for me. But what really upsets me is the harm to women. Many of them can’t get what they need. I’ve never said hormones are a cure-all. But we shouldn’t be so scared of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When we speak weeks later, Newson appears much more upbeat. She bounces on to a Zoom call with a big grin, hair immaculate as ever, and framed medical certificates on the wall of her study behind her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She explains that she has been buoyed after meeting a couple at a conference who thanked her for her weekly podcast, which discusses menopause issues and treatment and has had nearly nine million downloads. “The husband said, ‘It’s our anniversary today. Two years ago, my wife thought she had dementia [menopause can cause memory loss]. It’s only due to your podcast that she looked into hormones. Now she’s on HRT, our whole life is transformed.’ And I remind myself, it’s not a placebo, it’s not a coincidence. Those sorts of encounters are really humbling. Women are making choices with my information, and I think that’s really important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Yes, the last year has been awful, but I’ve dealt with really hard things in my life before. Like when my dad died [Newson was only nine]. And I’ve made this unwritten rule to myself that nothing is worse than your father dying. So you’ve just got to keep going.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Besides, she says with a peal of laughter, her three daughters, aged 14, 21, and 23, won’t let her quit. &lt;br&gt;“They say, ‘You get back out there.’ I respond that ‘no, I can’t do it.

When she founded her clinic in 2018, 1.3 million women in England took hormone replacement therapy, a treatment designed to replace oestrogen and progestogen, which decrease during the menopause. Her campaign for greater awareness of the benefits of HRT, alongside personalities including Davina McCall and &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/mariella-frostrup-why-is-menopause-still-taboo-fd2krgc7z" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Mariella Frostrup&lt;/a&gt;, has driven a surge in prescriptions to 2.8 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.12"&gt;&lt;div id="6c7ddb7d-7bc7-4b9e-88e1-77d04250441e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Davina McCall discusses the menopause with Newson on ITV’s Loose Women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ITV/SHUTTERSTOCK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson, 55, had not intended to make female hormones her career. A self-described “girly swot” who achieved a distinction in exams, Newson trained as a hospital physician and initially wanted to become an oncologist, but decided it was not compatible with family life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I couldn’t find a female role model in the hospital who was happily married,” she says. “They were single, or divorced, or they had back-to-back childcare and never saw their children. And I wanted my daughters to know me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson, who also has a first-class honours degree in pathology, went into general practice and produced books on evidence-based medicine. She says she realised women suffering a variety of symptoms for menopause and the perimenopause transition period — from physical changes including hot flushes to mental changes such as mood swings and anxiety — were simply not getting the right help. Many were fobbed off, she claims, or &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/a-generation-of-women-over-50-stuck-taking-antidepressants-sdfj8dlcz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;given antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; with serious side-effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About a decade ago, when she began getting night sweats and headaches and experiencing low mood, a gynaecologist explained her oestrogen was extremely low and, with the ordinary daily dose of 100 micrograms, her body was not absorbing enough to make a difference. Her dose was gradually tripled to 300mcg, and her symptoms improved. She opened her clinic the next year, charging from £195 per appointment and promising women “unbiased, evidence-based information” to support their hormonal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson Health quickly became known as being more proactive in prescribing HRT, which is given as pills, patches or gels, and more willing to give higher dosages than many NHS GPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1a6ac307-566f-46e2-aad1-954052a9bb80" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Heart of the controversy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is where we get to the heart of the controversy. Under guidelines from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the highest recommended daily dose of oestrogen is 100mcg when delivered in patches, or its equivalent in tablets or gels. Practitioners are allowed to give higher dosages where necessary. Many specialists do. But the risk of cancer associated with HRT has put many GPs off moving above 100mcg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2002 study linked combined HRT (with both oestrogen and progestogen) to breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots, leading to panic and widespread abandonment of the treatment. While the dial has since shifted to widespread acceptance that the benefits of HRT outweigh these risks, many experts caution against long periods of higher amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Channa Jayasena, a consultant endocrinologist and lecturer at Imperial College London, says: “The higher doses have not been explored for their ability to add value to the low doses. We know in medicine that more isn’t always better, and more can be dangerous … it’s not a desirable thing to do unless you have a good reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson firmly disagrees. There is unlikely to ever be a randomised controlled study on higher doses due to ethical and funding considerations, but she says the medical fraternity needs to look at other evidence. She points to peer-reviewed observational studies of women placed on higher dosages that call into question the claims of higher risk. She also emphasises that the risk of cancer is based on tests of synthetic hormones rather than the body-identical drugs she prescribes, which have the same chemical structure as hormones produced naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="884b1ec7-f3e9-450c-8b81-b312c2cd8b00" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;The oestrogen/progesterone row&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Experts say matching oestrogen and progesterone is crucial because on its own higher doses of the former can lead to bleeding and thickened womb lining, which can be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Newson says she will prescribe higher oestrogen without automatically increasing progesterone, in consultation with the patient, if it is necessary to improve symptoms. She points to a recent peer-reviewed study of 200 of her private patients, which showed no increased risk in women on body-identical HRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She says some women need higher doses because they do not absorb the oestrogen from patches and gels. “If I’m prescribing at 300mcg they won’t necessarily get that amount in their body. You could literally fill a bath of oestrogen gel with 100,000 times the maximum dose … I could sit in it and none of it would absorb in my body.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Critics of Newson highlight that as many as one in four patients at her private clinics are given oestrogen at higher doses. “Women come to me after they have tried the NHS … and can’t get the right dosages,” she says. “It’s not surprising.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="623c3ed8-d58e-4fd9-9a12-af7aeb98d053" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Battle with British Menopause Society&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As Newson’s profile rose, she found herself pitted against the British Menopause Society (BMS), a charity that provides education and guidance to medics. In 2023 the BMS and five other bodies, including the Royal College of GPs, issued an alert that oestrogen “should not be regularly prescribed in doses higher than the upper limit” due to safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Panorama&lt;/i&gt; programme in September last year, which involved two trustees and one specialist member of the BMS, revealed that Newson had been taken off its specialist register because of concerns over her practice. One former patient said she developed endometrial hyperplasia, a thickening of the womb lining that can be a precursor to cancer. She was one of more than a dozen Newson Health patients who made allegations to the BBC about complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson says “anyone can have cancer, but that does not mean that the hormones have caused it”. She points out that when one of the patients from the programme complained to the GMC the case was quickly dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are “literally thousands of patients who have been happy with their treatment”, Newson says. She has passed her required annual appraisal as a doctor and a separate complaint to the GMC about Newson personally was also rapidly dismissed. The CQC inspection is continuing; the process was restarted after one of the inspectors was linked to the BMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although Ofcom dismissed a complaint by Newson about &lt;i&gt;Panorama&lt;/i&gt;, she maintains that she is experiencing a “witch-hunt” because she has challenged orthodoxy, and that organisations such as the BMS are too risk-adverse. She says she was astounded when a subject access request — a formal application for personal data held by an organisation — showed BMS trustees had exchanged dozens of emails about her work, describing her as an irritant and the “Joan of Arc of menopause”. The BMS says the messages have been taken out of context, and that it acted on legitimate concerns by removing Newson from its specialist register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson counters that many of her views are being taken out of context too. She says she increases dosages only when “absolutely necessary” and routinely advises patients on other options. “People think I’ve got some fixation with hormones, but I can just see the benefits. I advise on exercise, nutrition and lifestyle changes as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She also feels dismissed by those in the medical profession who believe she is “just a GP” rather than a specialist. “I wrote four books on evidence-based medicine and worked as an academic. I have read literally every paper out there on this subject . The word on the street is that I’m this maverick doctor, and it’s simply not true. I collect my data and I publish more in peer-reviewed journals than any other menopause clinic in the world on original research. And I’m actually a really careful, cautious doctor. But I do want to help women get what they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="538ead7e-e048-42e2-a5db-a5bdbde57574" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Louise Rachel Newson: curriculum vitae&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Born&lt;/b&gt; August 11, 1970&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Education &lt;/b&gt;Pathology and medicine degrees from University of Manchester&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Career&lt;/b&gt; GP in Solihull, Birmingham, from 2003 to 2018; writer and editor at GP Magazine for over 20 years, alongside other work in medical publishing.

			&lt;p&gt;A single, half-hour session of moderate exercise is enough to confer an immediate mood-boosting effect, and now scientists have figured out why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice – and likely humans – that boost comes from the release of a hormone called adiponectin, which travels into the brain and sparks activity in a region associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/feeling-happy-and-sad-heres-how-our-brains-manage-mixed-emotions"&gt;emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;. The result is a lift in mood that could hang around for hours, although the duration has yet to be measured in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some pretty incredible implications here. For &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-depression-changes-the-very-structure-of-the-brain-scientists-find"&gt;people who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; exercise&lt;/a&gt;, even one workout could offer immediate relief for symptoms of anxiety or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="183019" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism could inspire a class of new, fast-acting antidepressant drugs that take effect much more quickly than traditional treatments such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-antidepressants-may-have-another-surprising-effect-on-your-brain"&gt;SSRIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-melancholia-depression-can-be-diagnosed-by-facial-expression"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Severe 'Melancholia' Depression Can Be Diagnosed by Facial Expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rapid-acting antidepressant treatments that offer sustained effects and minimal side effects remain scarce," neurobiologist Sonata Suk-yu Yau of Hong Kong Polytechnic University &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/scientists-identify-a-fat-derived-hormone-that-drives-the-mood-benefits-of-exercise/"&gt;told Psypost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study provides clinical evidence for the effectiveness of a single session of exercise in alleviating depressive symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing physical activity is widely recognized as a means of both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-new-study-shows-why-exercise-should-be-the-first-choice-in-treating-depression"&gt;treating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-hour-of-exercise-a-week-can-be-enough-to-prevent-depression"&gt;preventing&lt;/a&gt; mild to moderate depression. However, not much is known about the effects of a single bout of moderate exercise – a nice jog, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence seems to suggest &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2022.102172"&gt;that bursts of exercise&lt;/a&gt; have a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000001321"&gt;positive effect&lt;/a&gt; on individuals with depression; Yau and her colleagues wanted to quantify that effect and identify the reason behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 40 adult humans between the ages of 18 and 40, and a few dozen mice across multiple experimental groups, and got them to work exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The humans were the easy part. Each participant filled out a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_of_mood_states"&gt;Profile of Mood States&lt;/a&gt; survey to assess their mood. Then, they ran on a treadmill for 30 minutes while wearing a heart rate monitor. After exercising, they immediately retook the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants both with and without symptoms of anxiety and depression demonstrated a significant mood lift, with symptomatic participants reporting lower anger, confusion, fatigue, depression, and anxiety overall. Meanwhile, esteem and vigor rose across all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out why, the researchers turned to the mice. This is where it becomes unpleasant. To induce depression-like symptoms, some of the animals were put through several weeks of a protocol called chronic unpredictable stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the mice are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00006"&gt;subjected to prolonged exposure&lt;/a&gt; to a variety of inconsistent and unpredictable stressors, such as wet bedding, restraint, a tilted cage, or holding a mouse's foot to an electrified pad for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It results in reductions in grooming behavior, exploration, and curiosity, and an increase in immobility when put through physical tests, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2024.149123"&gt;similar to symptoms of depression in humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mice were not subjected to this protocol to serve as the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the mice were given a similar burst of moderate exercise on a treadmill, and their behavior was assessed. It worked: both stressed and unstressed mice showed behaviors associated with an elevated mood, including grooming and increased mobility, and spent a longer time attempting to swim when placed in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects were measured at 2 hours post-exercise, and persisted for at least 24 hours; by 48 hours, the effects had subsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out why, the researchers euthanized freshly exercised mice and studied them. They found higher levels of a hormone called adiponectin in both the blood and the medial prefrontal cortex of the mice after exercise, a region of the brain that includes the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt;, a crucial region for emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging and mapping revealed that adiponectin switches on a receptor in certain neurons called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin_receptor_1"&gt;AdipoR1&lt;/a&gt;; knocking out that receptor in those neurons in another mouse cohort eradicated the behaviors associated with a positive mood boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On further investigation, the researchers found AdipoR1 activates a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APPL1"&gt;APPL1&lt;/a&gt; that moves into the neuron's nucleus, triggering a cascade of molecular changes that help build or strengthen synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurons also formed new &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_spine"&gt;dendritic spines&lt;/a&gt; – an effect that disappeared when APPL1 was blocked – suggesting that they, too, play a role in the mood-boosting effects of exercise. A similar dendritic disinhibition is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13809-8"&gt;triggered by ketamine&lt;/a&gt;, which could hold some clues about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key here, however, seems to be the activation of AdipoR1 – it's like the switch that turns on that post-exercise bliss-out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests a strong target for therapeutic intervention; indeed, scientists have been investigating the potential of synthetic adiponectin receptor agonist &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13081867"&gt;AdipoRon as a treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;, although it has not yet been tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study does show a clear mechanism for the mood boost conferred by a workout, suggesting that exercise may be a valid treatment regimen for individuals who struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-drug-might-offer-hope-for-those-with-difficult-to-treat-depression"&gt;finding an appropriate medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, our objective is to develop population-based guidelines with optimal single-bout exercise prescriptions for mood improvement, serving as an effective strategy to prevent the development of depression," &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/scientists-identify-a-fat-derived-hormone-that-drives-the-mood-benefits-of-exercise/"&gt;Yau said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03317-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond its comforting taste, black tea offers a variety of health benefits that extend far beyond its well-known caffeine content. Derived from the Camellia sinensis plant, black tea undergoes an oxidation process that transforms its natural compounds, enhancing both colour and flavour while creating powerful antioxidants. These plant compounds have been linked to improved immunity, heart and gut health, blood sugar regulation, mental clarity, and even hydration. Regularly enjoying black tea can be an easy, enjoyable addition to a balanced lifestyle, supporting overall wellness while delivering a warming, satisfying daily ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 surprising ways black tea supports your health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supports immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black tea contains plant compounds with antioxidant properties that can enhance immune function. Antioxidants help neutralise free radicals in the body, reducing cellular damage, inflammation, and the risk of chronic diseases. The oxidation process that black tea undergoes increases the formation of these protective compounds.

This combination has been shown in research to support sustained focus and attention, making black tea an effective choice for improving mental sharpness throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enhances heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polyphenols in black tea are linked to improved cardiovascular health. Drinking two cups daily can provide 400–600 milligrams of flavan-3-ols, a recommended amount for supporting heart function. These compounds help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and regulate blood pressure. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that black tea supplementation significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to control treatments. Incorporating black tea into a balanced diet may therefore support heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regulates blood sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black tea may play a role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest that it can improve glucose metabolism and support insulin sensitivity, which are key factors in preventing type 2 diabetes. Regular black tea consumption has also been linked to a lower risk of developing this condition. While it should not replace medical treatment or a structured dietary plan, drinking black tea can be a beneficial addition to lifestyle strategies aimed at regulating blood sugar and supporting metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supports gut health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research highlights black tea’s positive effects on the gut microbiome, and its consumption promotes beneficial intestinal bacteria, improving overall gut health. A healthy gut flora is crucial for digestive function, immune response, and even brain health. By supporting the microbiome, black tea may indirectly contribute to better digestion, enhanced immune function, and improved cognitive wellbeing. For those looking to nurture their gut, incorporating black tea into daily routines can be a simple, enjoyable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contributes to hydration&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite containing caffeine, black tea can help meet daily hydration needs. Moderate consumption provides fluids that generally outweigh caffeine’s mild diuretic effect. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated black tea count towards total fluid intake, making it a hydrating beverage choice. However, moderation is key, as excessive intake could lead to side effects like insomnia or a rapid heartbeat. Evidence shows that consuming up to eight cups of black tea per day does not negatively affect hydration, offering a tasty way to support fluid balance alongside water and other beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black tea offers a range of health benefits that extend well beyond its caffeine content. From supporting immunity and heart health to enhancing focus, regulating blood sugar, nurturing the gut, and contributing to hydration, this traditional beverage proves that its value goes far beyond flavour. Incorporating black tea into a balanced daily routine can be an easy, enjoyable step toward overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Neuroscience now shows that the patterns one repeats each day quietly sculpts neural pathways that influence how sharply they think, how quickly they learn, and how resilient they stay under stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, not every repeated habit can provide the same results, and only certain forms of consistency stimulate the neural circuits. Recently, AIIMS-trained Neurosurgeon Dr Arun L Naik (@doclogues), shared 10 best habits that, when done consistently, can make you smarter. Dr Arun says, “The brain thrives on repetition. When you do a task repeatedly, your neurons fire in the same pattern over and over.” He adds, “Neurons that fire together, wire together”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10 habits that help build a smarter brain &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1.

Conversely, people adhering to dietary patterns lower in inflammation (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, healthy fats) had lower odds of cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These habits aren’t any grand rituals and can be done consistently and easily on an everyday basis.

The treatment itself can cause incontinence and impotence, which can significantly affect quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Balanced against that, finding cancers early and treating them can save lives. But it's difficult for doctors to work out which cancers are going to be aggressive and spread, which means men can be treated unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The committe said the number of lives saved by screening does not outweigh its harmful effects on healthy men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Why not screen all high-risk men?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many predicted that all men at high risk of the disease were likely to be included in new screening plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the committee stopped short of that recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Despite black men having twice the risk of prostate cancer, it said there should be no screening for black men due to "uncertainties" around its impact, and a lack of evidence from clinical trials in these men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also recommended no screening for men with a family history of the disease, for the same reason - too many cancers would be overdiagnosed and overtreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But men with specific genetic mutations - called BRCA variants - develop faster-growing and aggressive cancers at an earlier age, making screening for them justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Treating these cancers earlier is more likely to benefit those men and outweigh the potential harm from unnecessary treatment, compared to men in the general population, the experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How do you test for BRCA variant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A genetic test is needed which looks for a mutation of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;These gene variants can affect men and women, increasing the risk of a range of cancers, including prostate, breast and ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Around three in 1,000 men have BRCA variants, but many will be unaware unless they have family members that are known carriers, and then had it confirmed with a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Experts say more genetic tests will need to be offered to high-risk men in future, in order to work out how many are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How many men get prostate cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some 55,000 men are diagnosed with the disease each year, and 12,000 men die from it in annually in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Is this the final word on screening?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;No, a three-month consultation on the recommendations starts today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The committee will meet again after that and give its final advice to ministers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They will then have to make their own individual decision on prostate screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Wes Streeting, Health Secretary in England, says he wants screening in place but only if it's "backed by evidence". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said he would examine the evidence "thoroughly" ahead of his final decision in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 19:06:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1DbmJlWEU3Vy1sam14UVp0SHdkTzUxLVYxQ1hXeW4yX1FiYmpSMlpyc09pNmYxVmt4Y0t4QjB5MURBVzZmX3ljYU1aQ1RkS0QyV2w0NmxDVnI3Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE42OUJEMC04WGxKSW5EYVFtNHdYTmZJS0hhdEYyQTFKd3AxOTFaZzBUNlM4Q0F6ZzJVSmR0SnpuM0VPcFpRUFVTejBYRl9tNlpDbDViRmtjT0liWUNBSFZ3</guid></item><item><title>想要减缓大脑衰老吗？这些活动可能会有所帮助。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/11/27/brain-aging-creative-activities/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="topper-text-elems" class="wpds-c-kebnqj wpds-c-kebnqj-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-topper" class="wpds-c-cBzrLX wpds-c-cBzrLX-cmVlgk-isCenterNS-false wpds-c-cBzrLX-iyHTpF-useUATStyles-true wpds-c-cBzrLX-ieuxqEo-css"&gt;&lt;h1 id="main-content" data-qa="headline" data-testid="headline" class="wpds-c-eRlesA wpds-c-eRlesA-dHdMuz-isOnSplitTopper-false wpds-c-eRlesA-bAbYzz-isStyle-false wpds-c-eRlesA-iPJLV-css"&gt;Want to slow down brain aging?

					&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev are now saying that while weight loss in middle age could help the waistline, it may also hurt the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that after diet-induced obesity in middle-aged mice, weight loss lowered blood glucose, which is a positive benefit. However, it also caused aggravated inflammation in the hypothalamus, a region in the brain that regulates appetite, energy balance and many other vital functions. Similar inflammation is known to be linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by MD-PhD student Alon Zemer and Dr. Alexandra Tsitrina at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, under the supervision of Faculty of Health Sciences Prof. Assaf Rudich of the Obesity Research Lab and Prof. Alon Monsonego of the Neuroimmunology Lab, recently appeared in the peer-reviewed journal, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01933-x"&gt;Gero-Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected findings raise new questions about how weight loss in midlife may impact brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWeight loss remains essential for restoring metabolic health in obesity,â€� Zemer told The Times of Israel in a teleconference call with Rudich. â€œBut we need to understand the impact of weight loss on the mid-age brain and ensure brain health is not compromised.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Skinny on weight loss: Israeli researchers warn dieting in middle age may harm the brain"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;People in their middle age â€œare increasingly likely to try and lose weight by dieting, with anti-obesity medications, or surgery,â€� Rudich said. â€œThe findings show that we need to make sure we are not igniting an unwanted inflammatory response in the brain during the active phase of losing weight.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Studies about weight gain, but not weight loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 64 percent of Israelis are &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/tel-aviv-university-study-argues-third-of-normal-weight-israelis-are-secretly-obese/"&gt;overweight&lt;/a&gt; or obese according to World Health Organization standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Rudich said that he and Zemer found that most basic research using mouse models largely ignored the investigation of what happens to the body after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;â€œMost of the line of research is about young mice gaining weight,â€� he said. â€œWe wanted to look at processes occurring during weight loss instead of weight gain, and specifically in older individuals.â€�&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695344" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/assaf_rudich_2-e1763889307777.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3695344" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/assaf_rudich_2-e1763889307777-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers monitored the weight gain and loss of young mice, similar to 20-year-old humans, as well as middle-aged mice, comparable to individuals aged approximately 40 years or older. (One mouse year is equivalent to 40 human years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWe gave them a high-fat diet and they were gaining weight really nicely,â€� said Zemer. â€œThey almost doubled their weight following eight weeks of this diet. We just let them eat as much as they wanted. Following these eight weeks, we reversed it. Half of the high-fat group went back to a controlled diet, and we let them lose weight, kind of naturally.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists said that both the younger and older mice lost weight quickly. Their bodies became healthier, with blood sugar levels returning to normal in both groups. Since high blood sugar can lead to diabetes, lowering it benefits the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older mice lost almost 60% of the extra weight they had gained. However, when the scientists looked closely at their brains, they found neuroinflammation of the microglia, the brainâ€™s immune cells. The microglia regulate brain development and neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695400" class="wp-caption  aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/52525.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3695400" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/52525-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From left, the microglia from middle-aged mice. Obesity increases the volume and structural complexity of the cells. During weight loss, instead of reverting to the lean stateâ€™s structure, cells were further inflamed. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe middle-aged brain appears to be sensitive to this weight loss, and during the period of losing weight, responds with increased neuroinflammation beyond that already triggered by obesity,â€� Zemer said. â€œAnd this is something that occurs in mid-age but is not apparent in young adult mice.â€�&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsitrina said that high-advanced microscopy and image analysis with advanced computational analysis enabled the detection of sensitive changes in the microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that the study showed the body’s adaptive response to weight loss through two complementary dimensions: on a molecular level, by examining signals inside the cells, and on a structural level, by examining the shape and activity of the brain cells. These findings have â€œpotential health ramifications,â€� she said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From left: young and middle-aged mice were fed an obesity-inducing diet for eight weeks, and the weight loss group was switched back to the normal diet. The pie charts show that instead of reversing obesity-induced genes, most genes in the hypothalamus aggravate the effect of obesity during active weight loss (red). Lower left: microscopic analysis of the hypothalamus showing that microglia (green) further augments the total volume they occupy. Lower right: Advanced microscopic analysis of microglia (two are shown from each group). The volume of individual microglia increases with obesity and further increases by weight loss in middle-aged mice. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers understand that people want to â€œrelieve the risks associated with obesity,â€� said Rudich. â€œBut we need to test it closely because sometimes we come up with surprising results that make us think in new directions. So, research not only provides answers, but it also brings up new questions.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe study demonstrated that not all weight loss is alike,â€� said Dr. Amir Tirosh of Sheba Medical Centerâ€™s Endocrinology and Diabetes Research Center, who is not connected to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695363" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1534.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3695363" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1534-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written reply to The Times of Israel, Tirosh said that since the study uses a mouse model and needs to be validated in humans, â€œwe will need more studies to understand the long-term effects of this remaining brain inflammation.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemer said that the research team is now embarking on a new study to look at different areas of the hypothalamus and to try to gain an even deeper understanding of what is happening with these cells, and what processes can or cannot be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWe want to understand what happens when people lose weight and then, six months later, gain back every single pound they lost during this time,â€� Zemer said. â€œDo we get any beneficial effect from this weight loss? Or, is it somehow preferable to be weight-stable? Do we gain health benefits by being lean or less obese, even if it is temporary, for several years only?â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWeight loss requires further investigation,â€� said Rudich. â€œWe might need to take action to try and protect the middle-aged brain when attempting to treat obesity.â€�&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As the years pass, it can become harder to get a good night's rest. The most common sleep disorder in middle-aged and older adults is chronic insomnia, which for many translates to around three years of relatively sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a popular, gentle exercise may improve sleep as effectively as the top insomnia therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong University exercise physiologist Parco M. Siu and colleagues compared the first-line treatment for this sleep disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), with regular sessions of tai chi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world practice tai chi, a low-impact martial art that originated in China, often referred to as 'meditation in motion'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;One Form of Exercise Improves Sleep The Most, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that science has shown &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;similar styles of exercise&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-to-get-a-better-night-s-sleep-according-to-science"&gt;as well as meditation and mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;) can benefit sleep, researchers suspected tai chi may be a useful companion to existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study recruited 200 ethnic-Chinese adults who were above the age of 50 and lived in Hong Kong. All participants had been diagnosed with chronic insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were prescribed a course of 24, one-hour group sessions of either CBT-I or tai chi (the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-form_tai_chi"&gt;24-form Yang style&lt;/a&gt;, to be specific) with 100 people assigned to each group. Sessions of either CBT-I or tai chi were held twice a week, for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183326" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183326" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-insomnia.jpg" alt="bar graphs show lower remission and response rate in tai chi group than cbt group in month 3, but equivalent remission and response rates for both treatments by month 15" class="size-full wp-image-183326" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183326" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Insomnia remission rate and treatment response rate for CBT-I and tai chi. (Siu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ,&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of these treatments, the CBT-I group reported a greater reduction in their insomnia symptoms than those in the tai chi group, with changes assessed using a common seven-question screening tool called the Insomnia Severity Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers assessed participants again 15 months later, the tai chi group had 'caught up', enjoying improvements in sleep quality and duration, quality of life, mental health, and physical activity level that were on par with the CBT-I group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 31 of the 85 tai chi participants who returned for the 15-month check-in had continued their tai chi practice after the intervention period, albeit at a lower frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, just 13 of the 82 CBT participants who returned for a follow-up assessment reported using the skills and knowledge they had acquired during their CBT sessions in the subsequent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that tai chi's accessibility and ease of integration into people's lifestyles may benefit its long-term effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic insomnia can have serious impacts on the body, placing individuals at a higher risk for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-linked-to-ultra-processed-foods-study-finds"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-neural-mechanism-linking-poor-sleep-depression"&gt;mental disorders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-may-spark-changes-in-the-brain-that-trigger-dementia"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important that people seek professional medical help for their chronic insomnia. CBT, unlike tai chi, has been proven to be an effective insomnia treatment with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But accessing CBT for insomnia can sometimes involve long waiting periods because of a scarcity of trained therapists, and depending on access to healthcare, appointments can be expensive or subsidized under limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183330" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-642x361.jpg" alt="One Form of Exercise Can Improve Sleep Long Term, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-183330" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183330" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tai chi's accessibility and ease of integration into people's lifestyles may benefit its long-term effectiveness.

Unlike Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, it primarily affects individuals in low-income regions where malnutrition is widespread. Also called malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus (MRDM), Type 5 diabetes occurs when chronic nutrient deficiencies during childhood or early development impair the pancreas, reducing insulin production. This insufficiency leads to elevated blood sugar levels, a hallmark of diabetes. People with Type 5 diabetes often have low body weight and may show physical signs of prolonged undernutrition. Management typically involves insulin therapy, although researchers are investigating alternative treatments, including oral medications, to improve patient outcomes and offer more accessible options for those living in resource-limited areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Type 5 diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes occurs when chronic malnutrition during childhood or early development hampers proper pancreatic growth. The pancreas is the organ responsible for producing insulin, a hormone essential for regulating blood sugar levels. When pancreatic development is impaired, insulin production is insufficient, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels, a hallmark of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially recognised by the International Diabetes Federation in 2025, Type 5 diabetes affects an estimated 20 to 25 million people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is most common in regions with high rates of malnutrition, particularly parts of Asia and Africa. Scientists are actively investigating ways to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this unique form of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms and signs of Type 5 diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent urination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blurred vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headaches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow-healing cuts and wounds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low body mass index (BMI below 18.5)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impaired skeletal growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enlarged salivary glands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes in skin or hair texture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 5 diabetes causes and risk factors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary cause of Type 5 diabetes is believed to be chronic undernutrition during critical periods of growth. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients during childhood or in utero can interfere with pancreatic development, leading to lifelong insulin insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at risk often have a documented history of malnutrition and present with low BMI at a young age. Researchers continue to study the mechanisms linking nutrient deficiency to pancreatic dysfunction and subsequent diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Type 5 diabetes is different from other types&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes is distinct from Types 1 and 2 in several key ways. Unlike Type 1, which is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells, Type 5 arises from chronic undernutrition that prevents the pancreas from developing fully. Unlike Type 2, which is often linked to obesity and insulin resistance, Type 5 typically affects individuals who are underweight and have a history of malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major difference is the age of onset. Type 5 usually develops before the age of 30, whereas Type 2 commonly appears in adulthood, and Type 1 can occur at any age. Additionally, people with Type 5 often do not have ketones in their urine at diagnosis, a feature commonly seen in Type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Complications and &lt;keyword id="31100674" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="diagnosis-of-Type-5-diabetes" source="keywords"&gt;diagnosis of Type 5 Diabetes&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes carries risks similar to other diabetes types, including cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and eye complications. Early detection and proper management are crucial to prevent these long-term health consequences. Blood glucose testing remains the cornerstone of diabetes diagnosis, with readings above 200 mg/dL typically indicating diabetes. In higher-income countries, healthcare providers use additional tests such as glycated haemoglobin (A1C), urinalysis, and antibody screening to differentiate between diabetes types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In low- and middle-income regions, limited access to these advanced tests often leads to misdiagnosis, with Type 5 diabetes frequently mistaken for Type 1. Key distinguishing factors include a history of malnutrition, age under 30 at diagnosis, low BMI, and the absence of ketones in urine at the time of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/what-is-wilsons-disease-understanding-its-causes-symptoms-and-lifelong-prevention-tips/articleshow/125619315.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;What is Wilson’s disease: Understanding its causes, symptoms, and lifelong prevention tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么患有癌症的男性应该更多地关注安吉丽娜·朱莉-《泰晤士报》</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/brca-gene-testing-prostate-6972k9khw</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-content-body" class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Most people had never heard of the BRCA gene until 2013, when the actress Angelina Jolie announced she had had a preventative mastectomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jolie, who lost her mother to ovarian cancer, revealed she had taken the decision to have both breasts removed after discovering she had a mutation to the BRCA1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Normal versions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes repair damaged DNA, which helps prevent tumours.

Most men only become aware of BRCA mutations if a female relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer has her DNA tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;NHS genetic testing is fairly limited: the health service has launched a BRCA testing programme for people with Jewish ancestry, who are six times more likely to carry faults in BRCA genes. People with a strong family history of cancer, particularly if relatives were diagnosed at a young age, can ask their GP for genetic testing, which involves a simple saliva swab to test DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Sir Mike Richards, chair of the NSC, acknowledged the committee’s decision would lead to “more people being tested for BRCA”, as men become more aware of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Women diagnosed with breast or ovarian should “communicate to their male relatives” if they had tested positive for BRCA, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But some experts raised concerns that GPs would be inundated with demands for testing. If people have a BRCA variant, there is a 1 in 2 chance that their children will inherit it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/start-prostate-cancer-testing-regardless-of-advice-wes-streeting-told-bhm0dchjp?srsltid=AfmBOooj4Bnu5pIaYy478S6hnq7WdkJItPYYf3YUG3JOkvAgUkGIJdJD" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millions expected to miss out on prostate cancer screening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ben Lamb, a consultant surgeon at Barts Health and UCLH NHS Trusts, said: “Screening of men with BRCA genes is good news, but these are a small minority of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, plus the majority of men do not know whether or not they carry BRCA genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This decision may drive a surge in BRCA testing from the educated, worried and affluent well which will not help those men most in need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Ros Eeles, who has pioneered research into BRCA genes at Institute of Cancer Research in London, also questioned the committee’s decision to only offer testing every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She said there should be annual testing “to avoid the risk that an aggressive cancer could be allowed to grow unchecked for a whole year”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The success of a new NHS screening programme for men with BRCA mutations will also be limited unless genetic testing is expanded, Eeles said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Today’s recommendation is indeed a vital step toward reducing deaths from prostate cancer. However, unless BRCA testing is expanded, there are thousands of men who will miss out on this screening programme. The NHS needs to offer BRCA testing to more men, starting by offering testing to male relatives of BRCA carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 17:41:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQdWszaUkyTm5vVWNPbnRUSFROSTVKSnNUd0NVUFNfWXdUYW45VHZzMVhiMWVOOVZkNENpTm1EbmFNRWZKdDM1NzhXb21ZRVRIVV9nOXRxeVJfYVJuVE1ZcDhXUnpNd25vRVE4SDZpamhxMFhaRUJPdkJpMFd2UEtBdWRpYlBhZE1naFln</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织警告麻疹爆发期间的免疫策略差距-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/warns-immunisation-strategy-gaps-amid-174110126.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported a sharp drop in deaths from measles in recent decades yet warned that growing outbreaks of the virus are exposing weaknesses in immunisation programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a new report, the health agency identified an 88% decrease in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024. Nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine since 2000, according to WHO’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The MMR vaccine gives long-term protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. MSD first launched a vaccine in the US in 1971 and the company currently remains one of the major manufacturers of the jab alongside GSK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the proportion of children receiving their first dose of measles increased in 2024 compared to 2023, the number of those receiving their second dose is still too low to stop transmission. According to WHO guidance, at least 95% coverage with two measles vaccine doses is required – this number stood at 76% globally in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite fewer deaths, measles cases are surging worldwide, with an estimated 11 million infections in 2024 – nearly 800,000 more than pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Children living in low- and middle-income countries are particularly at risk of the virus, though cases have resurged even in high-income countries that once eliminated it. This is because immunisation rates have dropped below the 95% threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of those hit by outbreaks in 2025 has been the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the highest number of cases this year since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rise in cases has come amid a volatile vaccine landscape in the US. Health secretary Robert F Kennedy (RFK) Jr has alternated &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/rfk-jr-shifts-stance-on-mmr-vaccine-amid-measles-deaths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:between endorsing and shunning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;between endorsing and shunning&lt;/a&gt; the MMR vaccine, a shot that is proven to provide strong immunity against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;RFK Jr &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/vaccine-sceptics-among-new-members-hired-by-rfk-jr-for-cdcs-vaccine-panel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:overhauled the CDC’s vaccine committee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;overhauled the CDC’s vaccine committee&lt;/a&gt; this year, replacing members with well-known vaccine sceptics and individuals who were critical of both the Covid-19 vaccines and related countermeasures such as lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The WHO did not directly call out the stance of President Trump’s administration on vaccines, though did warn that growing global outbreaks signal weaknesses in immunisation strategies and health systems. The agency also said that the world’s goal to eliminate measles by 2030 “remains a distant one”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “Measles is the world's most contagious virus, and these data show once again how it will exploit any gap in our collective defences against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Measles does not respect borders, but when every child in every community is vaccinated against it, costly outbreaks can be avoided, lives can be saved, and this disease can be eliminated from entire nations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"WHO warns of immunisation strategy gaps amid measles outbreaks" was originally created and published by &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/who-warns-of-immunisation-strategy-gaps-amid-measles-outbreaks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pharmaceutical Technology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pharmaceutical Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a GlobalData owned brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

&lt;p&gt;It may sound a little gross, but your poop could hold the &lt;strong&gt;key to saving lives&lt;/strong&gt;. While many of us have been flushing it away without a second thought, feces are now in demand in the world of medical research.&lt;strong&gt; Stool banks&lt;/strong&gt;, like the ones popping up across the U.S., are collecting and processing human feces to treat severe gut diseases, and even &lt;strong&gt;paying donors for their trouble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This emerging field, known as &lt;strong&gt;fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)&lt;/strong&gt;, is gaining traction as a way to treat chronic conditions. And believe it or not, it’s not just about fighting infections. Researchers are also looking at how fecal transplants might help treat autism, obesity, some cancers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fecal Transplants: More Than Just Poop&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering: what’s the big deal about feces, anyway? Why are doctors and researchers suddenly so obsessed with it? It turns out that your gut is &lt;strong&gt;home to a whole community of microbes &lt;/strong&gt;that play a role in keeping you healthy. These &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/microbes-dug-tunnels-millions-years-ago/" data-type="post" data-id="83998"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; help with everything from digestion to immune function, and when they get out of whack, it can lead to all sorts of health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: St. Joseph’s Health Care London&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Based on research featured in the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sjhc.london.on.ca/news-and-media/our-stories/secret-super-powers-of-poop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;St&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Joseph’s Health Care London&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves transferring healthy stool from a donor into someone with a diseased gut microbiome. The idea is to restore balance in the gut, which can help treat infections, inflammation, and other conditions. While FMT is most commonly used to treat&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6346998/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, there’s growing interest in its potential for treating a variety of other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea is to use it for ‘poo’ transplants, otherwise known as fecal microbiota transplantation,” explains Associate &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/nadeem-kaakoush" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor Nadeem O. Kaakoush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from UNSW Sydney. “That’s when poo products made from healthy donor poo are transplanted into another person to improve their health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not All Poop is Created Equal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone’s stool is up to the task. As much as researchers might like to use any available poop, there are &lt;strong&gt;some strict requirements for donors&lt;/strong&gt;. They have to be healthy and free of all kinds of nasties—viruses, parasites, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and so on. And even if someone looks perfectly healthy, their stool &lt;strong&gt;might not be good enough &lt;/strong&gt;to use for medical treatments. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Kaakoush&lt;/em&gt; also explained that the process of selecting donors is rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we transplant poo, we want to make sure the donor is free from blood-borne viruses (such as HIV or hepatitis). We also want to make sure their poo is free from parasites, and disease-causing viruses and bacteria (such as &lt;em&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/em&gt;) and certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On top of that, donors &lt;strong&gt;must live close to a stool bank&lt;/strong&gt;, as fresh samples are crucial for&lt;strong&gt; transplant success&lt;/strong&gt;. Even with all these hoops to jump through, there’s still high demand for quality stool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Donating Poop Could Pay Off&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As demand for fecal donations rises, stool banks are offering compensation for qualified donors. Some programs, like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodnatureprogram.com/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;GoodNature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;offer up to $1,500 a month for regular stool donations&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While that might seem like a strange way to earn a paycheck, it’s becoming more common as the medical field recognizes the importance of these donations. As &lt;em&gt;Dr. Kaakoush&lt;/em&gt; puts it:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “It is likely your donation will treat someone with recurrent &lt;em&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; infection. Otherwise, it would be used in a clinical trial or study to treat another important medical condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-orally-administered-fecal-microbiota-product-prevention-recurrence-clostridioides" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; FDA&lt;/a&gt; has already approved two commercial FMT products—&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebyota&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vowst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—both designed to reduce recurrence of C. difficile infections. The success rates for these treatments are impressive, with &lt;em&gt;Rebyota&lt;/em&gt; showing a &lt;strong&gt;70.6% success rate &lt;/strong&gt;compared to 57.5% with a placebo. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Vowst&lt;/em&gt; helped reduce recurrence in high-risk patients to just &lt;strong&gt;12.4%&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Illness is predicted to spread faster, infect more people and put higher-risk groups at greater chance of being seriously ill or hospitalized. Doctors and public health experts are warning people to take precautions, including getting this year’s flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For RNA viruses, such as influenza, survival is equivalent to replication. Every time the virus replicates in a host cell, it presents an opportunity for a mutation to emerge. While viruses are technically not alive, it is their nature to mutate and evolve. Through these mutations, they can become more contagious, evade immunity, and become deadlier. This past summer, as flu season cooled down in the Northern Hemisphere, it intensified in the Southern Hemisphere, giving influenza A (H3N2) another opportunity to &lt;a href="https://substack.com/redirect/485d93a3-5a6b-4697-a61d-a92d662ca722?j=eyJ1Ijoibmt3diJ9.QCd34Vl08F0GMIfuCN7EU1qCRF49hjJPir_c-RIbijo"&gt;mutate&lt;/a&gt; — and it did. According to scientists, seven mutations occurred, positioning the Northern Hemisphere to head into a rough flu season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a small group that emerged since June, and since it emerged, it’s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,” Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization’s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said in a media briefing &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/WHO/videos/866160182749483/"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;, about the strain H3N2 subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas, told Salon via email that the mutations “reshaped the areas that antibodies recognize,” making previous immunity, including immunity induced by the flu vaccine, less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Rajnarayanan said, this mutation’s significant antigenic drift, which is when the genes of a virus change, is “a real concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a narrow window to act — boost stockpiles, issue robust guidance, deploy resources quickly, and reinforce surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you combine the immune escape from this drastic drift with further changes that boost viral fitness as it spreads more (which help the virus replicate better in human airways), you get a season where flu spreads faster, infects more people, and pushes high-risk groups into hospitals sooner, pushing infrastructure and capacity concerns,” Rajnarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs are already here. In the U.K., Japan, and Canada, there have already been increases in flu cases, leading to an earlier-than-usual flu season. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data showed that &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/ukhsa-issues-flu-warning-after-32692632"&gt;flu-associated hospitalizations increased&lt;/a&gt; from the end of September into October, affecting people over the age of 75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Countries hit early may have been caught off guard and are scrambling to ramp up countermeasures,” Rajnarayanan said. “With early alerts now coming from our international partners, we have a narrow window to act — boost stockpiles, issue robust guidance, deploy resources quickly, and reinforce surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern is that this year’s flu vaccine was recommended before the new strain emerged. Fortunately, early studies show that the vaccine still offers some protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext"&gt;Eurosurveillance&lt;/a&gt; stated “our early estimates provide reassurance that current NH enhanced vaccines provide protection in children, adolescents and adults in the early period post-vaccination. The high VE [vaccine effectiveness] in children and adolescents strengthens the case for optimising vaccine uptake in this group, where we could also see indirect protection of other age cohorts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In England, the National Health Service issued a “flu jab SOS,” urging those eligible for the free vaccine to get it quickly and protect themselves this winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned about everything related to infectious disease under the Trump administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But public trust in the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://source.washu.edu/2025/09/trust-in-cdc-on-flu-vaccines-falls-nearly-20-among-st-louisans/"&gt;is declining, and no such similar call to action has been made&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, surveillance of the virus has been lacking. During the record-breaking government shutdown, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/disease-surveillance-government-shutdown"&gt;stopped updating key dashboards&lt;/a&gt; tracking influenza, RSV and COVID-19 activity. While tracking resumed after the shutdown, some public health experts aren’t confident that a tough season will be well-managed by the public health agency under Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/robert_f_kennedy_jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned about everything related to infectious disease under the Trump administration because the chief of HHS is an anti-vaccine advocate and doesn’t even believe in the germ theory of disease,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Salon. “He has destroyed the CDC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and author of the newsletter Your Local Epidemiologist, told Salon, that it’s important to note that states still collect data to send to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within CDC, there is an important distinction between political operatives and CDC scientists,” Jetelina said. “The scientists are still in control of the data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But streams of data are thinner, Rajnarayanan noted, and more delayed because of the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the mutations, Adalja said getting vaccinated is still the best way for people to protect themselves against the flu this season because the vaccine contains three strains. While it’s a “mismatch” for the H3N2 strain, it’s still protects the H1N1 or influenza B components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dominant H3N2 strain has evolved away from the H3N2 included in the vaccine so the vaccine strain is not perfectly matched to it,” Adalja said. “The influenza vaccine remains the best way to protect oneself from the virus, especially against severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajnarayanan said while masks are “not popular in the USA right now,” they are still a good option for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stay home when sick and seek early testing and antivirals if you’re high-risk and develop symptoms,” he said. “Layering these simple measures will significantly reduce transmission and protect the people most likely to become seriously ill.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The winter is often synonymous with cold and flu season. Unfortunately, those germs aren’t the only ones spreading widely around this time of year. So gird your stomachs and stay on the lookout for the dreaded norovirus, because it might soon be running rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html"&gt;latest surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cases of norovirus are likely surging in the U.S. Just last week, about 14% of lab tests came back positive for norovirus, double the rate three months earlier, while several states are now experiencing relatively high case numbers. These early indicators suggest that the U.S. will experience a harsh norovirus winter for the second year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Stomach flu on the rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though norovirus is often associated with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/2025-has-been-a-nightmare-year-for-getting-violently-ill-on-cruise-ships-2000667251"&gt;cruise ships,&lt;/a&gt; it’s a ubiquitous and highly contagious foodborne germ. And it’s been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/norovirus-cases-are-surging-right-now-2000544279"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; as of late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between August 2024 and July 2025, for instance, the CDC documented at least 2,675 outbreaks in the U.S., almost double the amount reported in the same period the previous year (1,478). More recently, the pace of outbreaks in the fall &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html#:~:text=During%20August%201%20%E2%80%93%20November%2013%2C%202025%2C%20there%20were%20153%20norovirus%20outbreaks%20reported%20by%20NoroSTAT%2Dparticipating%20states.%20During%20the%20same%20period%20last%20seasonal%20year%2C%20there%20were%20235%20norovirus%20outbreaks%20reported%20by%20these%20states."&gt;seemed&lt;/a&gt; to settle back down. But norovirus is especially prevalent during the winter, as more people spend time indoors, and the early data isn’t looking good for a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The 14% test positivity rate this mid-November is right around the same rate observed during the same time period last year. In December 2024, the country &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/norovirus-cases-rise-us/story?id=117138204"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a record-breaking surge of norovirus, with a peak testing rate of nearly 25%. According to Epic Research’s &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/data-tracker/communicable-diseases"&gt;data tracker&lt;/a&gt;, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are currently experiencing the highest number of reported norovirus cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What to do about noro&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s no guarantee that norovirus this winter will reach or surpass the peak seen last year. But even a relatively mild season will lead to plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/norovirus/"&gt;gastrointestinal misery&lt;/a&gt;. Annually, norovirus causes about 20 million cases of vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S. And though it’s rarely fatal, the illness still sends roughly 100,000 Americans to the hospital every year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given all that, it’s always prudent to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html"&gt;do what you can&lt;/a&gt; to reduce your risk of catching and spreading the stomach flu to others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should always wash fruits and vegetables and cook your shellfish thoroughly, for instance. You should also clean your kitchen utensils, cutting boards, and surfaces, especially after preparing shellfish. And you should thoroughly wash your hands after handling uncooked food, since norovirus or other foodborne germs could be transmitted by your hands inadvertently touching your mouth later.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And if you’re feeling queasy, you should avoid direct contact with people if possible and consistently wash your hands with soap and water (hand sanitizer will not work against norovirus).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that might be easier said than done with Thanksgiving and the holidays coming right up. But as anyone who’s had norovirus can attest, it’s an experience that you should try to avoid as much as possible. Speaking personally, I’m crossing my fingers that scientists &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/from-covid-to-norovirus-modernas-mrna-tech-takes-on-stomach-flu-2000550591"&gt;finally figure out&lt;/a&gt; how to make an effective norovirus vaccine sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

so they do not need treating, the National Screening Committee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Their recommendations are based on the balance between lives saved by finding cancers early, and treatment that leaves patients unable to control their bladder or maintain an erection, whose cancer was not going to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The UK National Screening Committee recommends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening programme for all men as it is "likely to cause more harm than good"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening for black men due to "uncertainties" around the impact due to  a lack of clinical trials in black men&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening based on family history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;but screening should be offered every two years for men between the ages of 45 and 61 if they have specific genetic mutations - called BRCA variants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;These were not touch-and-go opinions as there was a "strong consensus" on each of these recommendations, the committee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;BRCA variants increase the risk of certain cancers and, famously, led the actress Angelina Jolie to have her breasts removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Around three in 1,000 men have BRCA variants, but many will be unaware unless they have family members that are known carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The National Screening Committee was asked to explain why they had not recommended that more men be tested for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Freddie Hamdy, who is also a urological surgeon in Oxford, told me: "The diagnosis of prostate cancer in a healthy man is a hugely disruptive event – with potential to affect quality of life, very significantly, for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It cannot be done lightly, men need to be really well counselled and informed before the 'snowball' starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Before you know it, you are on the operating table having your prostate removed – and we see examples of that all the time," Prof Hamdy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The screening committee's decision is not the final word. Today is the start of a three-month consultation before the committee meets again and gives its final advice to ministers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who will each have to make their own decision on prostate screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Wes Streeting, Health Secretary in England, responded saying he wants screening "provided this is backed by evidence" and that he would examine the evidence "thoroughly" ahead of the final advice in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Responses to the screening recommendations have been divided. Cancer Research UK said it was "good news" that screening was being considered for men with faulty BRCA genes and that they "support the committee's conclusion" that screening could cause more harm than good for other groups of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sir Chris Hoy said he was "extremely disappointed and saddened", and described tests for men with BRCA variants as "a very small step forward" that was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I know, first hand, that by sharing my story following my own diagnosis two years ago, many, many lives have been saved.  Early screening and diagnosis saves lives," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Laura Kerby, the CEO of Prostate Cancer UK, said she was "deeply disappointed" and that the decision will "come as a blow" to tens of thousands of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prostate Cancer Research said the decision was "a serious error that ignores modern evidence" and was a missed opportunity for Black men and those with a family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Lives saved, but what's the cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A huge clinical trial - called Transform - has now started to try to fill gaps in the evidence on how screening could be safely rolled out to other groups, including those with a family history and black men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Hashim Ahmed, who is leading the trial, said the recommendations were based on a "solid piece of work" and that while some men will be disappointed, he felt the right decision had been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is a small benefit… but the harms of diagnosing, testing and treating very much outweigh those benefits," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cancer Research UK has used the latest evidence from the UK National Screening Committee to calculate the impact of screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They say if you test 1,000 men aged 50 to 60:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="twenty-eight" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Twenty-eight&lt;/b&gt;: Would be diagnosed with prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="two" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Two&lt;/b&gt;: Lives would be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="twenty" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Twenty&lt;/b&gt;: Would be "over-diagnosed" meaning a slow-growing tumour that doesn't need treating would be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="twelve" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Twelve&lt;/b&gt;: Men are then likely to have treatment like surgery or radiotherapy that doesn't benefit them, but comes with harms potentially including being unable to control your bladder or maintain an erection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 16:07:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1NdmdUWWpydXhhTVhsTlhKT3VpTWNObjdjZng5ajVuTm5DWV9tUTNOLW10c0tack94Z2hfM3hMVmxfTU5iaXhvSGlacDJ5cWpfQUF0YV9YcHRfd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5fcmtzYUNLT3dMLXo1ZkpBb0RoMFk5ellxUmdYVHlaemlmRXQyc3lsd2k5TkpSNjZGVjhJYVJBVXc5VzZxcDNZa0VWR0N4T1FEeTh4Rmo1SW5oNmMzU3Z3</guid></item><item><title>2种有效的自然控制血糖的饮料以及如何在家制作-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/2-effective-drinks-to-control-blood-sugar-naturally-and-how-to-make-them-at-home/photostory/125639296.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest World Health Organization report released in The Lancet on World Diabetes Day states that the number of adults living with diabetes worldwide has surpassed 800 million, more than quadrupling since 1990. The analysis, conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), highlights the scale of the diabetes epidemic and an urgent need for stronger global action to address both rising disease rates and widening treatment gaps, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Number of people having diabetes has grown from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. And this one disease is the major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart issues, strokes and lower limb amputation. The data clearly reflects that diabetes is one of the rapidly growing global diseases and it is important to pay attention to our diet and lifestyle habits to stay away from it. Nature has blessed us with many natural remedies that can be added in daily diet to control blood sugar. Dr Hansa Yogendra, who runs the page called The Yoga Institute on YouTube explained that there are two simple and humble drinks that can help control blood sugar naturally.

Though President &lt;a href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/donald-trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; ultimately dropped a proposal to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the administration's throttling of funds forced clinics to shut down and disrupted key community programs, the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The funding crisis has exposed the fragility of the progress we fought so hard to achieve,” &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/november/wad-2025-report" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS. “Behind every data point in this report are people—babies and &lt;a href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/children"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; missed for HIV screening or early HIV diagnosis, young women cut off from prevention support, and communities suddenly left without services and care. We cannot abandon them. We must overcome this disruption and transform the AIDS response."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its reporting on the Trump administration's decision to halt official commemoration of World AIDS Day, which is on December 1, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/new-york-times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

A special group of engineered mice did not. These mice carried a version of a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-related-air-pollution-causes-liver-damage/"&gt;liver protein&lt;/a&gt; that changed how their bodies handled linoleic acid, the main fat in soybean oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may be the first step toward understanding why some people gain weight more easily than others on a diet high in soybean oil,” said study co-author Sonia Deol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineered mice stayed lean even though they ate the same amount as the others. Their livers stored less fat. Their blood sugar control stayed steadier. Nothing in their behavior explained the difference. Their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oil-and-gas-pollution-is-fueling-a-public-health-crisis/"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-soybean-oil-changes-molecules"&gt;Soybean oil changes molecules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linoleic acid converts into oxylipins inside the body. These small molecules rise sharply when diets contain a lot of soybean oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular mice showed high levels of specific oxylipins that tracked closely with weight gain. The engineered mice, however, produced far fewer of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier work showed that linoleic acid binds to the liver protein HNF4α. The new research showed something deeper. Different forms of this protein push linoleic acid down different chemical paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineered mice carried the form that slowed the conversion of linoleic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/old-oil-wells-are-getting-a-new-job-storing-carbon/"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; into harmful oxylipins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several enzymes in that pathway ran at lower levels. Humans also vary in these enzymes, which may explain why reactions to the same diet differ so widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-shifts-inside-the-body"&gt;Energy shifts inside the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolomics revealed another layer. The engineered mice had higher levels of molecules tied to mitochondrial activity. These included ketone bodies and several parts of the TCA cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts often point to stronger energy use. Regular mice showed the opposite pattern on soybean oil. Key energy molecules dropped. That drop suggests slower energy turnover, which can push the body toward storing more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver lipids also told a clear story. Regular mice built up triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters on the soybean oil &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthier-diet-could-boost-memory-delay-dementia/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;. The engineered mice carried much less of these storage fats. Their livers stayed lighter, cleaner, and less stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four oxylipins stood out as the strongest predictors of obesity. Regular mice showed steep increases in these molecules. The engineered mice did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers tried blocking one enzyme in the oxylipin pathway, body weight did not fall. That result narrowed which oxylipins truly drive weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-differences-between-the-diets"&gt;Differences between the diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soybean oil intake in the United States rose sharply over the past century. It now delivers nearly ten percent of daily &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-fewer-calories-helps-the-aging-brain-rewire-itself/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this intake comes from ultra-processed foods. Despite containing no cholesterol, soybean oil raised cholesterol levels in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Soybean oil isn’t inherently evil,” Sladek said. “But the quantities in which we consume it are triggering pathways our bodies didn’t evolve to handle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also compared soybean oil with coconut oil. Regular mice gained more weight on soybean oil. Engineered mice gained the same amount on both oils. This means their resistance applied to soybean oil’s chemical effects, not to fat intake as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation markers did not rise in the liver. Still, the engineered mice carried lower levels of certain cytokines linked with obesity in humans. They also held higher DHA levels, a fatty acid known for its calming effect on tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-soybean-oil-turns-harmful"&gt;Where soybean oil turns harmful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to a simple idea. Linoleic acid itself is not the main problem. The trouble begins after the body converts it into certain oxylipins. Those molecules rise sharply on heavy soybean oil intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They push &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-can-derail-metabolism-and-raise-diabetes-risk/"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; toward fat storage. When the body makes fewer of them, weight gain slows. Stronger mitochondrial activity adds another layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It took 100 years from the first observed link between chewing tobacco and cancer to get warning labels on cigarettes,” Sladek said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope it won’t take that long for society to recognize the link between excessive soybean oil consumption and negative health effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human studies are not underway yet. Still, the message is clear. What the body makes from a food can matter more than the food itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soybean oil seems simple on the surface, but its chemistry inside the body tells a more complicated story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(25)00195-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Lipid Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 15:08:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPWDVYbDRYNlpUaFJCQy11dVRYWjRCaVNoRTdEY1hjT1JwTF83RXdUcUtoc1JIU2JVQ3YzakRnMmJaNDhiZnhOMTc4WUtidUIzLXdUakQ0cFlqbC01b2wxWlJxNzc0Q2NCcGNPLU5uWkY5X2JYYURIdmttcTN6cFM4cjBNU0hmSlhN</guid></item><item><title>我去寻求修复我的新陈代谢。以下是我学到的东西- GQ</title><link>https://www.gq.com/story/i-went-on-a-quest-to-fix-my-metabolism-heres-what-i-learned</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My metabolism, it seems, has fallen off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first noticed that things weren’t quite as they should be this past spring. After last year’s period of &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-build-a-healthy-thanksgiving-plate"&gt;festive indulgence&lt;/a&gt;, I hit the gym again, dialed up my running, and locked in my diet in the same way I have been doing for the past five years. Only, at age 35, all my usual hacks didn’t seem to be having the same effect. I’ve never been super in shape, but usually a few weeks of work would leave me fairly happy with how I looked. Now, no matter how much I &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/run-faster#:~:text=Four%20ways%20to%20do%20speed%20work&amp;amp;text=A%20stride%20is%20the%20sequence,90%20seconds%20rest%20between%20each."&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; or diet, I can’t seem to &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-lose-weight-quick-healthy-1#:~:text=Exercise%20is%20a%20great%20way,through%20the%20post%2Dworkout%20afterburn."&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re cooked,” says my friend Joel when I bring this up. Joel has an active job, and he’s been running 40 miles a week to and from work—and he has kids to keep him busy. But we’re both in the same boat. “I’m not losing any weight, even with all this running,” he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving in to the cruel ravages of time, I thought I’d try and do something about it. I contacted the best experts around to see if they could help me, Joel, and you understand what metabolism actually is, and how we might kick-start it once it starts to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is metabolism, exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your metabolism is a combination of many factors which can change as we grow,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/gareth-nye" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/gareth-nye"}' href="https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/gareth-nye" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Gareth Nye&lt;/a&gt;, a lecturer in biomedical science at the University of Salford. “One important factor is your basal or resting metabolic rate (BMR)—the number of calories you burn as your body performs basic life-sustaining functions, or essentially the calories you would burn staying in bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, someone might have remarked on your ability to lie around all day, eat burgers, and still be slender, attributing this to a fast metabolism. The thing is, our bodies aren’t growing as they did when we were younger, so keeping the metabolic fire stoked now takes a bit more work. Especially when you factor in the more sedentary and stressed life of a middle-aged guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no coincidence that most people complain about being unable to lose weight in their 30-40s as it’s normally when adults are at their &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32929308/" target="_blank"&gt;most stressed&lt;/a&gt; and busy with work and family,” says Nye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are things slowing down now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body is doing exactly what it was designed to do,” says Dr. Harpal Bains, a longevity doctor and medical director at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/about/our-team/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/about/our-team/"}' href="https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/about/our-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Harpal Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “From an evolutionary perspective,” she continues, “men were built to peak in their late teens and early 20s to compete, reproduce and protect the tribe.

Not necessarily. Keep reading for more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange juice is often lauded for its vitamin C levels, making it a great &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69500925/immunity-foods-for-cold-flu-season/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food to eat come cold and flu season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;food to eat come cold and flu season&lt;/a&gt;. But the latest research says there may be even more benefits associated with drinking an orange glassful every day. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.70299" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new small study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;new small study&lt;/a&gt; finds that drinking orange juice every day boosts longevity and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, researchers found that drinking 100% OJ (without added sugar) daily boosted health and longevity markers in participants by modulating their genes and gene expression, a process that “determines how active certain genes are, essentially ‘turning on‘ or ‘turning off’ specific functions in the body,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and women’s health expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes made in participants’ gene expression after drinking 500 millilitres (about 17 ounces) of no-sugar-added orange juice for 60 days related specifically to the body’s ability to regulate blood pressure, inflammation, and metabolism—all factors that contribute to cardiovascular performance and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and women’s health expert; and &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC and LabFinder contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study featured 20 healthy adult participants aged 21 to 36 and tracked changes in more than 1,700 genes. Three days before the study began, volunteers restricted their consumption of citrus. Researchers gathered data using blood samples and body measurements, which were collected at the start and end of the study. They analysed genes via blood samples using bioinformatic tools. The findings, combined with those from a &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/fo/d1fo02664j" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, lead researchers to conclude that drinking 100% orange juice (sans added sugar) contributes to better body composition and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s one caveat: The effects varied based on participants’ body weight, says Manaker. Those who were noted as overweight saw more benefits in fat metabolism, while those considered leaner experienced stronger anti-inflammatory effects, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may suggest that body weight modulates the molecular response to orange juice and supports personalised dietary recommendations,” adds &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC and LabFinder contributor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health benefits of orange juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes orange juice a potential health game-changer? First, 100% orange juice is a source of flavonoids (a.k.a. antioxidants), particularly hesperidin, which combats oxidative stress, cell damage, and therefore, disease-causing inflammation, Manaker explains. “These natural plant compounds may influence gene expression, leading to the observed health benefits,” she adds. Vitamin C in orange juice also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this isn’t the first study to link orange juice to better health. “Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis published in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1865263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that drinking at least 500 mL of orange juice daily led to improvements in blood sugar, cholesterol, and inflammation markers,” Manaker notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you drink orange juice every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study benefits showed after participants drank roughly two 8-ounce glasses of OJ daily. It’s important to stress that these findings are based on drinking 100% fruit juice with no added sugar. Even then, the natural sugar content of orange juice—about 40 to 50 grams per 500 mL, Dr. Greene says—could be a concern for people with certain health issues, especially those with diabetes. “Excessive intake may contribute to caloric excess and high blood sugar in susceptible individuals,” Dr. Greene notes. If you have any pre-existing health conditions, she recommends discussing daily orange juice consumption with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are otherwise healthy, having a glass with breakfast isn’t a bad idea, so long as it’s consumed within a balanced diet that isn’t heavy in sugar. “It’s worth noting that most Americans fall short of the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables, which means they’re missing out on essential nutrients,” says Manaker. “Adding an 8-ounce glass of 100% orange juice counts as one serving of fruit and can help fill those nutrient gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:44:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOdnczaUc5ajBfWXEwWFZMM3pwVW9mcTQ1MHZDZjduNnhNbTJ2Rlg0MXhWOXRNQWlWNzJycGRtOHNaR2hCU2NKdWVkdkZ2cEJhU2NlTmtJX2ZxVGxhMWpTTlZUZlhtTWFTUjdPdnNQcVh6dEhjMVUzSUQ5a0t6UkdIRjE3ZThOQQ</guid></item><item><title>医生和护士正在呼唤您需要立即停止的“坏”健康习惯- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-bad-health-habits-mistakes-november-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

So many chronic illnesses we encounter are wholly preventable. Also, most issues are further complicated if the patient is already in poor physical shape. &lt;b&gt;Exercise and eating a balanced diet &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise-and-chronic-disease/art-20046049" target="_blank"&gt;can help&lt;/a&gt; stave off many chronic issues as you age.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that stuck with me was a patient, J.D., who was barely 50. J.D. suffered from hypertension and some diabetes. He was also getting treated for ulcers on his legs. J.D. was sedentary and overweight among his many, many issues. J.D. lived a life of 'just doing whatever.' Compare this to my over-55-year-old Brazilian black belt in my BJJ gym. Of course, he's nowhere near how he was in his prime, but good God, he rips us apart when he decides to spar with us somewhat seriously. From a young age, he basically lived his life like an athlete, and he's reaping the benefits as he ages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnluckyCustard8130/" target="_blank"&gt;u/UnluckyCustard8130&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As we get older, our brains start to change in ways that make them increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;vulnerable to disease&lt;/a&gt; – and a detailed new study of these changes points to a way some of this wear and tear might be prevented or reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Leibniz Institute on Aging – Fritz Lipmann Institute in Germany used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; to analyze the balance of brain proteins in both young and old mice, finding differences in a process called ubiquitylation as the animals aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin"&gt;Ubiquitylation&lt;/a&gt; adds chemical tags to proteins, telling the brain which of these busy molecules are past their peak and should be recycled. In older mouse brains, the ubiquitylation tags really start to pile up on certain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheap-daily-supplement-appears-to-boost-brain-function-in-older-adults"&gt;Cheap Daily Supplement Appears to Boost Brain Function in Older Adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our analyses have shown that aging leads to fundamental changes in how the proteins in the brain are chemically labeled," &lt;a href="https://www.leibniz-fli.de/news-events/details/aging-alters-the-protein-landscape-in-the-brain-diet-can-counteract-this"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Alessandro Ori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ubiquitylation process acts like a molecular switch – it determines whether a protein remains active, changes its function, or is degraded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183078" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnalysis.jpg" alt="Mouse analysis chart" class="wp-image-183078 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MouseAnalysis-600x395.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183078" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers checked changes in multiple brain processes as mice get older. (Marino et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through further tests on human neurons grown in a laboratory from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183074" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers determined that around a third of this accumulation was due to the slowing of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"&gt;proteasome&lt;/a&gt;, the brain's protein-recycling system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1906592116"&gt;have long known&lt;/a&gt; that protein management and cleanup become less efficient as brains age, what's new is the detailed link to ubiquitylation and the gradual accumulation of tags that the proteasome should be acting on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finely tuned system becomes increasingly unbalanced: many labels accumulate, and some are even lost, regardless of how much of a particular protein is present," &lt;a href="https://www.leibniz-fli.de/news-events/details/aging-alters-the-protein-landscape-in-the-brain-diet-can-counteract-this"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tried feeding older mice a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-reveals-an-easier-alternative-to-intermittent-fasting"&gt;calorie-restricted&lt;/a&gt; diet for four weeks before returning them to a normal diet to see if this would affect ubiquitylation. For some (but not all) of the proteins, this dietary intervention restored the chemical tagging to the state observed in younger animals when the normal diet was resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers didn't study the underlying mechanisms in detail, the implication is that protein tagging in the brain – hugely important for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheap-daily-supplement-appears-to-boost-brain-function-in-older-adults"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; – can be adjusted through diet, even in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are lots of caveats to consider – including that none of this has been tested in living humans yet – but the research takes us several steps forward in understanding some of the shifting processes that happen in the brain in later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be important in efforts to improve treatments for conditions where brain protein balance plays a role – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-buildup-in-brain-cells-could-provide-new-target-for-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;including Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-one-key-molecule-behind-exercises-anti-aging-power"&gt;Scientists Pinpoint One Key Molecule Behind Exercise's Anti-Aging Power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is an incredibly complex piece of biological machinery, making &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-one-crucial-protein-appears-to-reverse-brain-aging-in-mice"&gt;the study of it&lt;/a&gt; (and problems thereof) challenging. Even within this research, the observed changes weren't universal across all of the proteins and protein management processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that even in old age, diet can still have an important influence on molecular processes in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.leibniz-fli.de/news-events/details/aging-alters-the-protein-landscape-in-the-brain-diet-can-counteract-this"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, diet does not affect all aging processes in the brain equally: some are slowed down, while others hardly change or even increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60542-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But environments include the foods we eat and the infectious diseases we are exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very important part of the environment is the climate and what kinds of conditions we can live in. Our culture helps us change our exposure to the climate. For example, we build houses and put furnaces and air conditioners in them.

So the genes that allowed them to digest milk increased in the population until nearly everyone could drink milk as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process, which occurred and spread thousands of years ago, is an example of what is called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2025.08.003" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2025.08.003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cultural and biological co-evolution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This practice would cause kidney damage in other people because the kidney regulates water in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These examples show how the remarkable diversity of foods that people eat around the world can affect evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2d297254-e188-4dde-b22e-a37a804d2118"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: BSIP via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-de03947b-38bf-4d3c-9a9e-375b8889b881" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="diseases-that-threaten-us-3"&gt;Diseases that threaten us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ea3e6dfc-0771-4e71-b71e-a88c8ffabdca"&gt;Like all living creatures, humans have been exposed to many infectious diseases.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death across the globe. Keeping the heart in the best shape is crucial to keep these diseases at bay. What if you could make your heart strong by enjoying some delicious foods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by researchers at King’s College London found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-025-04481-5" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;eating polyphenol-rich diets is linked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to better long-term heart health.

The researchers found that people who regularly consume polyphenol-rich foods and drinks, such as tea, coffee, berries, cocoa, nuts, whole grains and olive oil, may have better long-term heart health. Polyphenols are natural compounds found in plants and have long been linked to various health benefits, including improved heart, brain and gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How polyphenols help the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVDs led to an estimated &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;19.8 million deaths in 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which is approximately 32% of all global deaths, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the effects of polyphenols on the heart, the researchers followed more than 3,100 adults from the TwinsUK cohort for over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed that diets rich in specific groups of polyphenols were linked to healthier blood pressure and cholesterol profiles, which contributed to lower CVD risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analysed a large number of metabolites in urine that are produced when the body breaks down polyphenols. These biomarkers confirmed that higher levels of polyphenol metabolites, especially those derived from specific groups of polyphenols, flavonoids and phenolic acids, were linked to lower cardiovascular risk. They also had increased HDL cholesterol, the ‘good’ cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the experts are saying&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart health starts with your diet. “Our findings show that long-term adherence to polyphenol-rich diets can substantially slow the rise in cardiovascular risk as people age. Even small, sustained shifts towards foods like berries, tea, coffee, nuts and whole grains may help protect the heart over time,” Professor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos, senior author and Professor of Human Nutrition at King’s College London, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research provides strong evidence that regularly including polyphenol-rich foods in your diet is a simple and effective way to support heart health. These plant compounds are widely available in everyday foods, making this a practical strategy for most people,” Dr Yong Li, first author of the study, added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that, as cardiovascular risk naturally increases with age, higher polyphenol intake was associated with a slower progression of risk over the 11-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

These early signals mean that your body is suffering internally because of pollution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He outlined these symptoms that indiacte the toxic air is taking a toll on your body:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent dry or scratchy throat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pollution strips moisture from the throat’s mucosal lining, causing a constant tickle, dryness, or the urge to clear your throat frequently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soreness or burning sensation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chemicals, smoke and fine particles inflame throat tissues, making swallowing painful, especially in the morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry, irritating cough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your body tries to expel pollutants through coughing. A pollution-triggered cough usually feels dry, repetitive and worse outdoors or during peak AQI hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoarseness or voice changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inflammation of the vocal cords can lead to a raspy voice, reduced volume or difficulty speaking for long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurrent throat or upper respiratory infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prolonged exposure to polluted air weakens local immunity, making you more prone to viral and bacterial infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watery or itchy eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Air pollutants irritate the eye surface, causing redness, excessive tearing or itching, a common companion to throat irritation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nasal congestion or runny nose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pollutants inflame nasal pathways, triggering rhinitis-like symptoms that worsen breathing comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing difficulty or chest tightness (especially in asthma and COPD patients)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pollutants can trigger bronchospasm, making breathing feel heavy or constricted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red-flag symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Vaishnav suggested calling a doctor and visiting the ER immediately if you notice:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Symptoms persist beyond 3–4 days despite home care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Severe or increasing throat pain, especially with difficulty swallowing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Productive cough with yellow or green phlegm (possible infection)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High fever, chills or body aches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shortness of breath, wheezing or chest tightness, especially in people with asthma, COPD or heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bluish lips, extreme fatigue or dizziness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Persistent hoarseness or voice loss lasting more than a week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any breathing difficulty in children, elderly adults or pregnant women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

According to data from the CDC, from 1999 to 2020 there was a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/publications/colorectal-cancer-stat-bite.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;185% increase in colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; among adults aged between 20 and 24, and a 333% increase among teenagers aged between 15 and 19. In 2020 alone, colorectal cancer led to more than &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/colorectal-cancer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;930,000 deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the World Health Organization reports. Recognising the symptoms early could mean the difference between life and death. In a video shared on Instagram, Dr Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, shared five warning signs of colon cancer that one should not ignore. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is colorectal cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cancer that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;starts in the colon or the rectum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is called colorectal cancer, as per the American Cancer Society. When the cancer starts in the colon, it is called colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Hidden Signs of Colon Cancer You Could Be Ignoring That Might Save Your Life | Dr Deep Goel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, family history, inherited colon cancer-related mutations (HNPCC, FAP, and Peutz–Jeghers polyposis), a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and environmental and lifestyle factors play a crucial role in increasing the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs of colon cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More and more young people are getting diagnosed with colon cancer,” Dr Sethi said. Detecting colon cancer early can significantly improve treatment options and outcomes. Here are five symptoms that you should not ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blood in stool&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rectal bleeding could be a warning sign of colon cancer. If you find any blood in your stool, in the toilet bowl, or on toilet paper after a bowel movement, do not dismiss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Change in the shape or size of your poop&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you should never dismiss changes in your bowel movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi noted that a “change in the shape and size of your stool could indicate narrowing of the colon”. So, if you notice any changes in your stool, and if they are persistent, it is time to book an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chronic abdominal pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you often feel pain in your belly? It should not be dismissed as ‘just diet’. Dr Sethi warned that chronic abdominal pain is a major symptom of colon cancer. If your ongoing cramping, bloating, or discomfort does not resolve with typical remedies, you should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight without trying is a red flag for various cancers. If you notice the number on your weighing scale going down without changes to your diet or exercise routine, you must talk to your doctor. This is also a symptom of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel tired all the time? If you wake up tired, even after a restful night’s sleep, you should be concerned. This is, unfortunately, one of the crucial signs that may go unnoticed. People often dismiss it as simple tiredness. But if you feel fatigued often, without any reason, it is important to seek medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iron deficiency anaemia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This symptom is often silent until detected via routine blood work. Tumours in the colon can bleed slowly and continuously, leading to iron deficiency. “Iron deficiency anaemia can happen even if you don't notice any obvious bleeding,” Dr Sethi explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above-mentioned signs and symptoms may point to colon cancer; however, having them does not always mean so. “Keep in mind these issues can be seen with a lot of other medical conditions, so make sure to check with your doctor,” Dr Sethi said. However, being aware of these symptoms is important because early diagnosis can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;The first child in history has successfully been treated with a new genetic therapy for an ultra-rare developmental defect called Hunter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years in the making, Oliver Chu became the first in the world to receive the stem cell-based treatment in February, and 3 months later seemed to be a normal child again, meeting important milestones and playing without supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, which oversaw the trial of Oliver and 4 other patients, says that children with severe Hunter syndrome cannot properly break down complex sugar molecules and have widespread symptoms including rapid and progressive learning and memory problems, heart and lung dysfunction, hyperactivity and behavioral problems, bone and joint malformations and hearing impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cannot break down the sugars because their genetic code was formed with a defect: the gene that codes for the production of an enzyme called iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) doesn’t work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Brian Pigger, professor of cell and gene therapy at the University of Manchester, developed a method of replacing the faulty gene with a functioning copy, called autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Oliver Chu, from California, arrived at Royal Manchester for the first stage of the procedure. The 3-year-old had his blood cycled in a machine to extract the hematopoietic stem cells he produces naturally. These were then sent off to a laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where a functioning copy of the defective gene is inserted into a virus and placed inside the stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, mother Jingru cradled Oliver in his hospital bed as he received an injection of 125 million modified cells twice in the space of 2 hours. It was a momentous day that the young boy was completely oblivious to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days, Oliver flew back to California to reunite with his older brother Skyler, who also has the disease, and his father Ricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter syndrome affects almost exclusively boys, and then only 1 in 100,000 live births. A major challenge in the disease that can often be fatal is that treatment methods can’t cross the blood-brain barrier, as the major manifestation of the inability to break down sugars occurs in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commercially available drug called Elaprase can slow the effects, but can’t cross the blood brain barrier. It costs as much as a house for a year’s prescription. Another treatment has been to give regular infusions of the missing enzyme, just like a diabetic would take infusions of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONQUERING RARE DISEASES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="There Was No Treatment for His Son’s Rare Disease, so Dad Moves Mountains to Make One for Kids Worldwide" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/there-was-no-treatment-for-his-sons-rare-disease-so-dad-moves-mountains-to-make-one-for-children-worldwide/" rel="bookmark"&gt;There Was No Treatment for His Son’s Rare Disease, so Dad Moves Mountains to Make One for Kids Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0y56x6veo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;BBC reports&lt;/a&gt; that Oliver’s development has become remarkably normal. He’s talking all the time, and been able to stop the enzyme infusions. He runs around like any other 3-year-old, utilizing a newly-exploded vocabulary, and demonstrates genuine inquisitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it’s just so amazing,” his mother Jingru told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can see he’s improving, he’s learning, he’s got new words and new skills and he’s moving around much more easily,” said Professor Simon Jones, who ran the trial that saw Oliver and four other boys receive the gene therapy. “We need to be careful and not get carried away in the excitement of all this, but things are as good as they could be at this point in time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Skyler, who also has Hunter syndrome, he’s too old to receive his younger brother’s treatment. The 5-year-old receives infusions like Oliver used to, it allows him to regain some physical development normalcy, but the infusions can’t cross the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment window in the &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/groundbreaking-gene-therapy-trial-for-hunter-syndrome-opens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; was 3 months to 1 year of age. It was originally believed that Oliver was too old, but a battery of tests concluded there was still a window where the therapy might reverse the genetic defect in the brain as well as the body. Ricky is hopeful the treatment will prove successful, prompting further innovation into how it might help treat older children like Skyler.&lt;/p&gt;

And whenever they hear about sweet potatoes, they wonder: Are they actually good for blood sugar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their natural sweetness, sweet potatoes may seem like a food that could spike glucose levels. But nutrition research says the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potato, a common, humble root vegetable that is rich in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and slow-release starch, offers more than just comfort and taste. Research and nutritional reviews reveal that sweet potatoes are a “smart carb” choice: when prepared the right way and eaten in moderation, they can help stabilize blood sugar, support insulin sensitivity and long-term metabolic health, and offer vital vitamins and antioxidants. In fact, rather than being shunned like many starchy foods, sweet potatoes may belong in the “eat more” list — not as a cure, but as a supportive dietary ally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with prediabetes or diabetes, or those simply seeking stable energy and better metabolic health, knowing how to pick, cook, and eat sweet potatoes can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:21:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>糖与锯齿：肠道医生，帕尔博士对精制白色晶体之间更健康的选择进行了现实检查-经济时报</title><link>https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/sugar-vs-jaggery-gastro-doctor-dr-pal-gives-a-reality-check-on-healthier-choice-between-refined-white-crystals-and-traditional-indian-sweetener/articleshow/125546725.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-brcount="20" class="artText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A familiar debate resurfaced this week after &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/gastroenterologist" target="_blank"&gt;gastroenterologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr Pal Manickam shared a detailed comparison of sugar and jaggery on Instagram. While the traditional sweetener often enjoys a reputation for being the healthier pick, the doctor urged viewers to understand what actually happens once these foods enter the bloodstream. His explanation was featured in a video highlighted by an Instagram post, where he broke down myths attached to both ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pal began by addressing a common belief that brown sugar and jaggery are fundamentally different from white sugar. Referring to his demonstration in the video, he explained that brown sugar loses its dark colour when placed in water because the molasses drains out. He emphasised that the body treats most sweeteners the same way. Whether one consumes white sugar, brown sugar, jaggery or any organic variant, the bloodstream converts them into glucose, causing similar spikes in blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_125546725" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-125546725"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Palm Jaggery Gets Some Extra Points&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion, however, did not end with a blanket comparison. Dr Pal noted that palm jaggery has a slight advantage over refined white sugar. As cited from the video, he highlighted that palm jaggery has a lower &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/glycemic-index" target="_blank"&gt;glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This means it raises blood sugar more gradually, offering steadier energy levels. He added that palm jaggery is also more eco friendly because palm trees use less land and water than sugarcane. Its micronutrient content provides an additional edge, though he stressed that this benefit should not be overstated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_125546725" id="div-vdoai-mid-125546725"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clearing Up Confusion About Impurities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video also attempted to put rumours to rest regarding jaggery turning lighter in colour when dissolved. Dr Pal clarified that the whitening is simply the result of impurities dissolving and not evidence of adulteration. He added that this process does not wash away minerals and does not make jaggery unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-125546725" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-125546725" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Moderation Still Rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite acknowledging that jaggery is traditional, flavourful and slightly better than white sugar when consumed in equal amounts, Dr Pal issued a reminder that it remains a form of sugar. People should avoid treating it as a health food. He noted humorously that many avoid white sugar but freely indulge in jaggery, often consuming more than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pal Manickam, widely known for simplifying medical science through his signature blend of humour and explanation, is a board certified gastroenterologist and Director of Preventive Gastroenterology at a California based practice. His work often focuses on gut health, plant based diets and time restricted eating. With a strong social media presence, his content aims to inform the public through an approach that merges comedy with evidence based guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional guidance from nutrition experts underscores that both sugar and jaggery originate from sugarcane and offer similar calorie loads, despite jaggery’s reputation as a natural alternative. According to a recent Redcliffe Labs report, jaggery retains small amounts of minerals, but its high glycemic index means it can still raise blood sugar significantly, making moderation essential for everyone, including people with diabetes. Specialists advise that neither sweetener should be viewed as inherently healthier, and limiting overall intake remains the safest approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:15:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在人类基因组中发现新的“突变热点” - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-mutation-hotspot-discovered-in-the-human-genome</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have pinpointed precise regions in the human genome where DNA is most likely to develop a mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At spots where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"&gt;RNA polymerase&lt;/a&gt; 'opens' your DNA to read and copy instructions – known as transcription start sites – your genome is especially vulnerable to damage and the occasional imperfect repair that can lead to permanent changes. Scientists call these locations 'mutation hotspots', and they may be crucial for understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rare-genetic-disease-appears-to-defend-ashkenazi-jews-against-tb"&gt;genetic disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These sequences are extremely prone to mutations and rank among the most functionally important regions in the entire human genome, together with protein-coding sequences," &lt;a href="https://www.crg.eu/en/news/new-mutation-hotspot-discovered-human-genome"&gt;says geneticist Donate Weghorn&lt;/a&gt; of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-are-evolving-in-front-of-our-eyes-on-the-tibetan-plateau"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humans Are Evolving in Front of Our Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic mutation often occurs when damaged DNA is unable to repair itself correctly, resulting in a small but irreversible change to the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most mutations&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/mutationsanddisorders/neutralmutations/"&gt; are benign&lt;/a&gt; and have no effect on health or development. Rarely, mutations &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/homo-galacticus-how-space-will-shape-the-humans-of-the-future"&gt;can be beneficial&lt;/a&gt;.

Understanding the human genome's susceptibility to mutation is vital for developing accurate models for studying these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome damage &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.11.014"&gt;increases dramatically&lt;/a&gt; during a process called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)"&gt;transcription&lt;/a&gt;, where your DNA is copied into messenger molecules called RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of your genome as a cookbook, and a gene as a recipe in that cookbook. The RNA polymerase opens the cookbook to copy a recipe onto a post-it note – the RNA – before the book snaps shut. Damage can occur as a result of these actions, up to hundreds of thousands of times per cell per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weghorn and his colleagues wanted to know if this extra wear and tear at the places where transcription begins leads to a heightened rate of imperfect repair – the kind of repair that becomes permanent genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers dug into enormous human genome datasets, tracking extremely rare mutations (ERVs) across nearly 15,000 genes in more than 220,000 individuals. These are inheritable mutations that have persisted for several generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined data from 10 "trio" studies. &lt;a href="https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/blog/the-power-of-three-the-importance-of-trios-in-diagnosing-disease/"&gt;These are studies&lt;/a&gt; in which the genomes of a father, mother, and their shared child are sequenced to identify mutations that the child didn't inherit, called &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/de-novo-mutation"&gt;de novo mutations&lt;/a&gt; (DNMs). In other words, the mutation occurred randomly in the sperm, egg or after they fused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with ERVs, the researchers found a very strong and consistent mutation hotspot around transcription start sites. To refer back to the cookbook analogy, it's as though the chef tore the page when opening it, or dropped sauce on the page, and repairing that damage obscured or altered part of the ingredient list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the DNM studies, that hotspot mysteriously vanished. If it really existed, it should have appeared in new mutations as well as inherited ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer came from 11 previously published studies on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;mosaic&lt;/a&gt; mutations, which arise during the first stages of cell division after embryonic fertilization. It happens to every human; we all carry &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559193/"&gt;at least one cell&lt;/a&gt; with a mosaic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team looked at the mosaic data, the missing hotspot reappeared – in exactly the same place as the hotspot in the ERV analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early embryonic mutations were clustering at transcription start sites, but because mosaic mutations are patchy, they can look like sequencing noise, and many DNM study pipelines automatically exclude them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a blind spot in these studies," &lt;a href="https://www.crg.eu/en/news/new-mutation-hotspot-discovered-human-genome"&gt;Weghorn says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To get around this, one could look at the co-occurrence patterns of mutations to help detect the presence of mosaic mutations. Or look at the data again and revisit discarded mutations that occur near the transcription starts of genes most strongly affected by the hotspot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By looking at all three datasets together, the researchers were able to unravel the mechanisms behind the vulnerability in transcription start sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of a gene is a busy, fragile, and complex place where the RNA polymerase frequently pauses to briefly unravel the DNA. This machinery can misfire or leave the DNA exposed just a little too long, leading to damage that scars rather than heals cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a missing piece of the puzzle about where DNA mutations come from – and one that may improve studies of genetic conditions relying on de novo mutation data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66201-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Pre-diabetes represents a physiological turning point where blood glucose is elevated but still responsive to timely lifestyle adjustments. Researchers emphasise that this stage offers a meaningful chance to restore metabolic balance before permanent changes develop. Growing clinical evidence shows that strategic modifications in diet, physical activity, stress regulation and sleep patterns can improve glucose handling and, in many cases, reverse early abnormalities. As interest in practical, science-backed methods increases, understanding how targeted habits influence metabolic recovery has become highly relevant to public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What dieticians advise to manage pre-diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRhPGu2DW17/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Dietician Shweta Panchal, in her Instagram video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, encouraged individuals with pre-diabetes to take action before the condition transitions into type 2 diabetes. She emphasised that the early stage is largely reversible with consistent behavioural changes. Her recommendations are supported by the findings of a major systematic review in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076075/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Primary Care Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which shows that structured lifestyle interventions significantly reduce the risk of converting pre-diabetes into diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She outlined four steps: managing stress and sleep, integrating regular movement into daily life, replacing simple carbohydrates with low GI fibre-rich foods and avoiding late dinners to support better insulin regulation. Together these steps form an accessible and evidence-informed approach to stabilising blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4 practical steps to manage pre-diabetes effectively:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage stress and optimise sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay physically active with daily movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace simple carbohydrates with low GI fibre-rich foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid late-night dinners to support better glucose control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Managing stress and sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and poor sleep influence glucose stability because cortisol, the primary stress hormone, directly affects how the body manages sugar. When stress remains elevated or sleep becomes fragmented, cortisol levels rise and interfere with insulin’s capacity to transport glucose into cells. This creates fluctuations in blood sugar that are especially harmful for individuals experiencing early metabolic imbalance. Improving sleep duration and quality reduces cortisol surges, while relaxation techniques help the nervous system shift toward a calmer state that promotes steadier glucose uptake. Simple practices such as structured bedtime routines, quiet evening environments and brief mindfulness sessions can support a more regulated hormonal pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Consistent sleep stabilises cortisol and reduces glucose variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Stress reduction techniques enhance insulin responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Evening routines help balance metabolic rhythms and promote healthier glucose patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Daily movement and physical activity &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity remains one of the strongest tools for improving glucose regulation. When muscles contract during walking, strength exercises or even short bursts of movement, they draw glucose from the bloodstream, easing the demand placed on insulin. This improves metabolic flexibility and lowers fasting glucose over time. Movement also supports better circulation, enhances muscle strength and reduces inflammation, all of which contribute to better glycaemic outcomes. For individuals with pre-diabetes, incorporating simple activities such as brisk walking, home workouts or climbing stairs creates a metabolic environment that protects against rising glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Contracting muscles increase glucose uptake independently of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Frequent movement reduces post-meal glucose spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Moderate daily activity enhances long-term metabolic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Intake of low GI, fibre-rich foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food choices influence the body’s glucose response after every meal. Low GI, fibre-rich foods digest more slowly and release glucose into the bloodstream at a gentler pace, preventing sharp rises that strain insulin production. These foods offer sustained energy, support healthier gut function and reduce cravings that often accompany rapid glucose fluctuations. Examples include oats, lentils, beans, dal, vegetables, whole grains, apples and berries. Such foods also support weight management, which is particularly relevant in pre-diabetes where modest weight reduction can significantly improve glycaemic markers. As part of a balanced diet, fibre-rich foods help maintain a stable metabolic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slow digestion reduces the body's demand for insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Fibre supports steadier glucose absorption across the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Low GI foods help control appetite and improve satiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Timely meals and avoiding late dinners&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal timing has gained attention in metabolic research because insulin responsiveness follows daily rhythms. Eating dinner too close to bedtime affects digestion and leads to higher overnight glucose levels. When meals are consumed earlier, the body has adequate time to process nutrients, stabilise post-meal glucose and transition smoothly into the overnight fasting period. Finishing dinner at least two to three hours before sleep supports more efficient insulin function and reduces the chances of morning glucose elevations. This practice becomes more effective when paired with balanced meals and a consistent sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Early dinners improve overnight glucose stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Adequate digestion time supports hormonal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Consistent meal timing aligns with the body's natural metabolic rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle changes as a long-term metabolic tool&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle intervention is a powerful strategy for restoring metabolic health during pre-diabetes. The effects of these changes extend beyond glucose control, improving blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall inflammatory status. When habits such as regular movement, mindful eating, structured sleep routines and stress management are maintained, the body gradually becomes more responsive to insulin. These steady improvements can halt the progression of metabolic dysfunction over time. Unlike short-term fixes, lifestyle habits reshape biological processes in a sustainable way, allowing individuals to maintain a healthier metabolic profile as part of daily living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to consult a doctor for pre-diabetes management&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical consultation becomes necessary when blood sugar levels rise despite consistent lifestyle efforts, or when symptoms such as persistent fatigue, excessive thirst or frequent urination begin to appear. Professionals may recommend laboratory tests, including HbA1c, fasting glucose or glucose tolerance evaluations, to assess progression. Individuals with a family history of diabetes, hormonal disorders or metabolic syndrome may require more frequent monitoring. Clinical guidance ensures that lifestyle adjustments are effective and provides additional support if further intervention is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

    &lt;p&gt;Dr Macciochi takes a probiotic (a type of fibre) and postbiotic (dead microbes) that are thought to help repair the gut barrier and reduce inflammation. “Looking after the gut barrier can also change things like how your clothes fit [as they reduce bloating], the regularity of bowel movements and leave you with more energy,” she adds.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She uses powders which she mixes into soups or stews for lunch or dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Ergothioneine for supporting the brain and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ergothioneine is an antioxidant that protects us from oxidative stress,” Dr Macciochi says. The body can’t make ergothioneine and, while mushrooms and offal are sources, our diets don’t contain much of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know from some of the emerging research that it’s linked with brain health, longevity and healthspan,” she explains. “It’s a bit of a wild card, and the research is quite young, but I was convinced enough to start taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;CoQ10 for improving heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are so many longevity supplements around now and, while I’m not convinced by most of them, CoQ10 seems to be beneficial,” Dr Macciochi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that’s naturally found throughout the body. Its role is to fight free radicals, which are particles that damage cells, tamper with DNA and contribute to ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, patients who take statins are expected to benefit as the medication drives down CoQ10 levels. Research also suggests it can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in heart failure patients by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have decades of data showing it’s potentially really useful for longevity,” she notes. “I think it’s an underutilised longevity supplement.” Dr Macciochi takes it in capsule form in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Spermidine, quercetin and fisetin for healthy ageing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/anti-ageing-fasting-benefits-without-giving-up-eating/"&gt;Spermidine&lt;/a&gt;, quercetin and fisetin are the three I’ve most recently added to my supplement stack,” Dr Macciochi says. These are all plant compounds that help with “inflammageing”, which is the low-level, unwanted inflammation that builds up over time, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spermidine helps to rid the body of damaged cells (so-called zombie cells) linked to ageing by activating the body’s cell renewal and recycling process and, as a result, is thought to support the brain and heart as we age.

Nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine since 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an estimated 95 000 people, mostly children younger than 5 years of age, died due to measles in 2024. While this is among the lowest annual tolls recorded since 2000, every death from a disease that could be prevented with a highly effective and low-cost vaccine is unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite fewer deaths, measles cases are surging worldwide, with an estimated 11 million infections in 2024 – nearly 800 000 more than pre-pandemic levels in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is the world's most contagious virus, and these data show once again how it will exploit any gap in our collective defences against it,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Measles does not respect borders, but when every child in every community is vaccinated against it, costly outbreaks can be avoided, lives can be saved, and this disease can be eliminated from entire nations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases in 2024 increased by 86% in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, 47% in the European Region, and 42% in South-East Asian Region compared with 2019. Notably, the African Region experienced a 40% decline in cases and 50% decline in deaths over this period, partly due to increasing immunization coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While recent measles surges are occurring in countries and regions where children are less likely to die due to better nutrition and access to health care, those infected remain at risk of serious, lifelong complications such as blindness, pneumonia, and encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immunization coverage insufficient to protect all communities &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, an estimated 84% of children received their first dose of the measles vaccine, and only 76% received the second, according to WHO/UNICEF estimates. This is a slight improvement from the previous year, with 2 million more children immunized. According to WHO guidance, at least 95% coverage with two measles vaccine doses is required to stop transmission and protect communities from outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 30 million children remained under-protected against measles in 2024. Three-quarters of them live in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, often in fragile, conflict-affected or vulnerable settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) Mid-Term Review, also released today, stresses that measles is often the first disease to resurge when vaccination coverage drops. Growing measles outbreaks are exposing weaknesses in immunization programmes and health systems globally, and threatening progress towards IA2030 targets, including measles elimination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising number of outbreaks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 59 countries reported large or disruptive measles outbreaks – nearly triple the number reported in 2021 and the highest since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. All regions except the Americas had at least one country experiencing a large outbreak in 2024. The situation changed in 2025 with numerous countries in the Americas battling outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to scale up measles surveillance have improved WHO and countries' abilities to identify and respond to outbreaks, and for some countries to achieve elimination. In 2024, more than 760 laboratories participating in the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) tested over 500 000 samples, an increase of 27% from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, deep funding cuts affecting GMRLN and country immunization programmes are feared to widen immunity gaps and drive further outbreaks in the coming year. Securing sustainable domestic financing and new partners is now a critical challenge to advancing efforts toward a world free of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Striving for a measles-free world &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world’s elimination goal, as laid out in IA2030, remains a distant one. By the end of 2024, 81 countries (42%) had eliminated measles, only three additional countries since before the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional progress has been made in 2025 with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/news/item/26-09-2025-rubella-elimination-verified-in-japan--and-measles-and-rubella-elimination-verified-in-pacific-island-countries-and-areas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Pacific island countries and areas&lt;/a&gt; verified in September 2025, and &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/cabo-verde/news/cabo-verde-mauritius-seychelles-eliminatemeasles-and-rubella" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Cabo Verde, Mauritius and Seychelles&lt;/a&gt; verified this month, becoming the first countries in the WHO African Region to be verified for measles elimination. This brings the total number of countries that have eliminated measles to 96. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Region of the Americas regained measles elimination status in 2024 for the second time – the only region to ever be verified – but it &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;lost the status&lt;/a&gt; again in November 2025 due to ongoing transmission in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles has resurged in recent years, even in high-income countries that once eliminated it, because immunization rates have dropped below the 95% threshold. Even when overall coverage is high nationally, pockets of unvaccinated communities with lower coverage rates can leave people at risk and result in outbreaks and ongoing transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve measles elimination, strong political commitment and sustained investment is needed to ensure all children receive two doses of the measles vaccine and surveillance systems can rapidly detect outbreaks. The IA2030 Mid-Term Review calls on countries and partners to strengthen routine immunization, surveillance and rapid outbreak response capabilities, and to deliver high-quality, high-coverage campaigns when routine immunization is not yet sufficient to protect every child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to editors &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO uses statistical modelling to estimate measles cases and deaths each year, based on cases reported by countries, and revises the previous year's estimates to assess disease trends over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is a founding member of the &lt;a href="https://measlesrubellainitiative.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Measles &amp;amp; Rubella Partnership&lt;/a&gt; (M&amp;amp;RP), a global initiative to stop measles and rubella. Under the umbrella of &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationagenda2030.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Immunization Agenda 2030&lt;/a&gt; and guided by the&lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-agility2/measles/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/measles_rubella_initiative_final_print.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt; Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework 2030&lt;/a&gt;, M&amp;amp;RP’s mission includes addressing the decline in national vaccination coverage, hastening the recovery of the measles backsliding resulting from COVID-19 pandemic, and accelerating progress towards creating a world free of measles and rubella.

Conversely, a country is no longer considered to be measles free if the virus returns, and transmission is sustained continuously for more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Immunization Agenda 2030 global monitoring framework defines large or disruptive outbreaks as having ≥20 cases per one million population in a 12-month period.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            For decades, measles vaccination has been a global success story. Deaths from measles dropped 88% around the world from 2000 to 2024, according to a new report from the World Health Organization, with an estimated 58 million lives saved in that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiiceq66000c3b6qhe70oc4f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But now, with vaccine coverage well below the level needed to stop transmission, cases are surging. Fifty-nine countries reported large or disruptive measles outbreaks last year, almost triple the number reported in 2021. A quarter of outbreaks are happening in countries previously declared measles-free, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;Canada and the United States&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Global measles elimination remains a distant goal,” according to the WHO report released Friday. The progress of the last decades is in peril with the return of outbreaks and decline in resources for immunization and disease surveillance, according to the report — in particular, the US government’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/politics/trump-global-health-strategy-intl"&gt;reduced support&lt;/a&gt; for global health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Elimination means a virus is no longer circulating and that a country has the capacity to “shut down” infections that come in via visitors and travelers. Canada &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;recently lost&lt;/a&gt; its elimination status, and WHO is also concerned about the US backsliding and losing its status, said Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s Department of Immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmido5zpe00003b6nlhnp5dlc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that there have been 1,798 confirmed measles cases in the US this year, the highest number of cases since the country reached elimination status in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00043b6n585xkbi4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Measles remains the world’s most contagious virus,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Even though there’s a highly effective low-cost vaccine, the disease “exploits gaps in immunization coverage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiie5w5u00233b6qa0l781wh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, more than 30 million children were under-protected against measles in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmido28sx00063b6qfjpjvy14@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="victories-and-challenges" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Victories and challenges
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00073b6ntu131nbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been some victories, officials say. Measles deaths have dropped sharply since 2000. Every WHO country and region has committed to eliminating measles and rubella by maintaining at least 95% vaccine coverage, strengthening surveillance systems and making measles elimination goals part of broader health care efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00063b6nbm0x1k0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recently, Cabo Verde, Seychelles and Mauritius became the first countries in the African region to achieve measles elimination this year. Twenty-one Pacific island countries also eliminated measles and rubella this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00083b6nvbur61u2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have made measurable progress towards measles elimination,” said Diana Chang Blanc, unit head of WHO’s Essential Program on Immunization. But progress toward elimination is “still too slow. Cases and deaths are still unacceptably high.” Every measles death is preventable with a low-cost vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m00093b6nh4nfy9q7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three countries have yet to give the second dose of a measles vaccine as standard practice. That’s important, Chang Blanc said, because the second dose “increases vaccine effectiveness to 95%, providing most individuals with long-lasting immunity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidpf4z8000g3b6nfk02kggo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In 2024, only 84% of children received the first dose and 76% received the second dose globally. “This means that 30 million children remain underprotected from measles in 2024,” Chang Blanc said. “Children living in fragile, vulnerable conflict-afflicted settings are the most adversely affected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000b3b6noannrn25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Progress is not happening at the expected pace, she said, because of lower global immunization rates and backsliding of vaccination since the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been challenging for children who missed recommended vaccines during the pandemic to catch up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiiceoir000a3b6q0sfnjf9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles acts as a “fire alarm for immunization programs,” O’Brien said. When the disease resurfaces, “it warns that there are gaps in immunization coverage” and health care access inequities. That same gap persist with other vaccine-preventable diseases, too, like whooping cough and polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiicu54i00123b6q5mg3wi18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The alarm has already been sounding on vaccines. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted immunization program around the world. Measles vaccination levels are still slightly below pre-pandemic levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000c3b6nn1uwbtrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misinformation and disinformation are notable factors in slowed vaccination rates, WHO says. But access is still the most significant problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000e3b6n39wox3mh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chang Blanc said that the breakdown or lack of “a strong foundation in the routine immunization system” is the No. 1 reason for high measles case counts and outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidoe0yg00083b6qbxy9abzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although it sounds simple, Chang Blanc said, those routine systems require trained health workforces, logistic systems, transport, surveillance systems and other resources that many countries do not have.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmcc5m000f3b6ny3wm012l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The major barrier to reaching 95% measles vaccine coverage is “access to populations that need it most,” Chang Blanc said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidmz6ak001k3b6n156g4ac4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deep funding cuts aﬀecting the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network, which include 760 laboratories that help surveil and respond to outbreaks, and country immunization programs are “feared to widen immunity gaps and drive further outbreaks in the coming year,” the report says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidn9u2v00223b6npr362t7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Securing sustainable domestic financing and new partners is now a critical challenge to advancing eﬀorts toward a world free of measles,” the report says.

More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-789004" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ed4bb" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-492538" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination status threatened&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a41910" class="body-graf"&gt;The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-efcaa5" class="body-graf"&gt;Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus — smallpox — has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4b03d" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40cb1f" class="body-graf"&gt;Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08eca5" class="body-graf"&gt;But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9de51f" class="body-graf"&gt;The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4aacd" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-will-us-rcna242630" target="_blank"&gt;Canada met that threshold&lt;/a&gt; this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4fda67" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ac3b8a" class="body-graf"&gt;The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14fe9d" class="body-graf"&gt;Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs "are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a478e" class="body-graf"&gt;Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency "expects those results in the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31fe1c" class="body-graf"&gt;Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbed05" class="body-graf"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna240592" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow. The &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8239eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;state Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51410730/measles-confirmed-in-8-students-at-wasatch-high-utahs-total-eclipses-100-infections" target="_blank"&gt;NBC affiliate KSL&lt;/a&gt; reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54f56" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025. Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two little girls in Texas, have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPb1FUZHVCN0NjMTR6WFRfS051UXE4Q2pSSFhqeU8wRmJNaUZZN1VGSkEzaEtvQlotT2NpNlpuSHRyNnZEb2JsVE15Y3VDU1NGODdUTVdHcWwyZ3RRSEVGRC0yRGhVZmRHRXIxaGluU2ZvWHg5UDlsNkVEaVZCQlJISmtueWhPX18xUXlfMVliX0dQSmhkR1BKc0VYTDc1eFpuTjl4Y3U1MnpIVzjSAVZBVV95cUxPLTZXaHYxV0NTdVR3NU1SM29LNjBOOHAwb2R3dmFXRjB6VG1FOGV5TUM0Wk1hb0RONFdmTG9sQThBOXhpZjNZVG9MZkgzbDYzaXZBa09iZw</guid></item><item><title>有益于肝脏健康的最佳水果？这种空腹的日常水果可以创造奇迹-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/best-fruit-for-liver-health-this-everyday-fruit-on-an-empty-stomach-can-work-wonders/photostory/125635223.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When eaten first thing in the morning, fruits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;activate liver detox enzymes, especially vitamin C-rich options&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stimulate bile flow, crucial for digestion and toxin removal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhance nutrient absorption, since the stomach is clear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hydrate the body quickly, easing morning sluggishness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;promote gentle digestion, thanks to fiber and natural sugars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These effects collectively support smoother liver function and better metabolic balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, a simple morning ritual — like enjoying two apples, sipping lemon water, or mixing berries into a fresh morning bowl — can spark a noticeable improvement in liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fruits bring hydration, antioxidants, fiber, and enzyme-activating compounds that protect liver cells, improve detox efficiency, and support overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, always remember — moderation matters the most when it comes to consuming these fruits as they’re sweet in taste, and variety works best when it comes to jazzing up your palate.

Then there’s the legal transformation into an adult at 18: you can live alone, buy alcohol and cigarettes, vote, gamble and get tattoos and piercings without anyone else’s say so. And finally, 21, when nothing much happens at all – unless you’re particularly keen on adopting a child, holding a minibus or pilot’s licence and getting pissed in North America – but which has, nevertheless, been deemed a final step into maturity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet not one of these milestones is particularly reflective of our neurological development. Neuroscience has long shown that our &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/health-and-families/writing-mental-health-resilience-b2871463.html"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for impulse control, decision-making, planning and problem-solving, doesn’t fully develop until around the age of 25. But now a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has uncovered a whole new benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on brain scans of nearly 4,000 people, the research mapped evolving neural connections to identify five distinct “epochs”, or eras, for the brain, with changes occurring at four key ages: nine, 32, 66 and 83. Despite our ingrained societal ideas around when someone becomes a grown-up, these latest findings suggest that “adult mode” only kicks into gear &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/science/adult-brain-30s-teenagers-crime-mental-health-research-a8828681.html"&gt;in our early thirties&lt;/a&gt;. That’s when the architecture of our brains stabilises and coincides with a “plateau in intelligence and personality”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not at all surprised by this; if anything, I feel vindicated. Though lead researcher Alexa Mousley was quick to point out that they’re “definitely not saying that people in their late twenties are going to be acting like teenagers… It’s really the pattern of change,” the notion that I was an “adult” – responsible or otherwise – in my teens or twenties is risible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, I was always a late bloomer. At 16, I was still far too busy making up elaborate routines to the &lt;em&gt;Centre Stage &lt;/em&gt;soundtrack with my friends to contemplate coitus. At 18, I may have gone off to university, but I was also shamefully clueless (during a “how to cook pasta” lesson with my mother before leaving home, I really did respond with, “But how can I tell?” when told to wait until the water was boiling). At 21, I dressed up as a dolphin for my birthday party in a grotty nightclub, snogged a stranger, vomited copiously and turned up to my all-year lecture the next day still drunk and singing sea shanties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/26/12/20/iStock-1312770451.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/26/12/20/iStock-1312770451.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/26/12/20/iStock-1312770451.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Embrace the ‘hot mess’ era of your twenties" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-110239"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Embrace the ‘hot mess’ era of your twenties&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say that my twenties saw me develop some semblance of sophistication – and indeed, at the tail-end of that decade, I did finally find my way onto a more solid career path and started my first adult-feeling relationship. But, in all honesty, that period was mostly typified by hapless stumbling between dramas. There was the morning I slept through my alarm and turned up 90 minutes late to run a workshop for 500 young people; the day I got to the station and realised I didn’t have enough money to buy a train ticket to work; the time I accidentally &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/bills-life-admin-tasks-bank-b2605589.html"&gt;built up thousands of pounds in debt&lt;/a&gt; when I moved out of a shared flat and forgot to cancel all the direct debits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t even get into the romantic mishaps – we don’t have that kind of time – but suffice to say they were plentiful and ran the gamut from chaotic to embarrassing. “Making good decisions” was as alien a concept as flossing my teeth at that age. It would have been my “hot mess” era, had I actually been hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1wzq3bw-0 sc-1wzq3bw-2 kqnNdl mbxVq"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-i07cwn-0 dvtoxw"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7b73b88eb27c89ab" viewbox="0 0 80 47"&gt;&lt;path fill="#eb1426" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that I was an adult – responsible or otherwise – in my twenties is risible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I look back, the watershed moments that marked my transition into being a proper grown-up person with her s*** together are undeniable – and nearly every single one happened at around the time identified by the study. At the age of 31, I got a job at this very publication, the first time I really felt like I was intentionally steering my career in the desired direction. At 32, I &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/how-to-make-friends-new-town-b2310941.html"&gt;identified the coastal town where I wanted to build my life&lt;/a&gt; as an adult. At 33, I &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/taylor-swift-breakup-thirties-women-joe-alwyn-b2532689.html"&gt;broke up with my long-term partner&lt;/a&gt; because we both realised it wasn’t right – and that, in many ways, we’d always felt like adolescents playing house together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My generation, millennials, have long been accused of refusing to grow the heck up. We’re buying homes, getting married and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/babies-birth-rate-decline-fertility-b2605579.html"&gt;having children later&lt;/a&gt;, while continuing to cling on to childhood obsessions with Disney and Harry Potter. But aside from all the socio-economic factors that have led to this perceived arrested development, maybe we didn’t have it so wrong after all. Maybe “kidulthood” isn’t something to be denigrated but a completely natural phase of life, embodying the chaotic whirlwind of our twenties before we wise up, settle down and get comfortable in our own skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not to say we should stay Peter Pans forever. Just that your twenties are for making mistakes, learning from them and figuring out who you want to be. So the next time you miss your train, mess up your finances or go home with someone questionable, just apologise, shake it off – and explain that science made you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 10:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPRlBERGdWd3NyVmlfLXJsNFlXRTJLUGhXV1poSVJ1VVBIemE0aUtSc2U4bWpJT2d1UlZ4QUctcFVhSDlUZXhsRlJiYUF1SUVWMWZiMFk1aGhabmVvVkxGQ1JTcHNoUC0wR1ZWMWNmdnBYV3RJMVB5OHhLbFRYalVHY3dQUElmSmxPSlRNcQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
