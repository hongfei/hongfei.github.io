Recent research highlights that small bedtime habits can significantly improve deep, restorative sleep. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(23)00219-7" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by UC Berkeley researchers found that synchronized brain waves during deep sleep, called slow waves and sleep spindles, play a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. Individuals with better synchronization experienced improved insulin sensitivity the following day. Take a close look..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding shows that activating the brain’s natural “sleep switch” can have real, measurable health benefits. Simple evening habits can encourage your brain to enter this deep, restorative phase, improving not just restfulness but also long-term metabolic health. In this article, we’ll explore science-backed strategies to optimise your bedtime routine, enhance deep sleep, and wake up feeling genuinely refreshed every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

Prioritising good sleep hygiene, such as reducing screen time before bed and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, can help enhance the quality of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC Berkeley study showed that individuals with better brain wave synchronization during deep sleep had improved insulin sensitivity the next day. This suggests that quality deep sleep is linked to both metabolic health and overall wellness. Poor deep sleep has been associated with increased risks of diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline, making it essential to prioritise this stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Science-backed evening habits for better deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing specific habits before bedtime can activate the brain’s natural sleep mechanisms and enhance deep sleep. Practices such as reducing screen time, dimming lights, practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule help prepare the body and mind for restorative rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dim your lights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bright light in the evening can suppress melatonin, the hormone that signals to your body it’s time to sleep. Reducing light exposure an hour before bed helps your brain prepare for restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Limit screen time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phones, tablets, and TVs emit blue light that disrupts melatonin production. Avoid screens at least 30–60 minutes before bed to support natural sleep rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create a calming pre-sleep routine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle stretching, meditation, reading, or listening to soothing music can relax your mind and body. A consistent pre-sleep routine signals your brain that it’s time to transition into deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stick to a consistent sleep schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and stay in deep sleep longer. This consistency supports better hormone regulation, improves mood, enhances cognitive function, and can even strengthen your immune system over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Optimise your sleep environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Comfortable bedding and minimal noise reduce disturbances, promoting longer periods of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle factors that impact deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nutrition matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime can interfere with sleep cycles. A light, balanced snack that includes protein and complex carbs may help, while staying hydrated without overdoing fluids before bed is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can improve sleep patterns and increase deep sleep duration. Avoid vigorous workouts right before bed, as they may be stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also See: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/7-vs-9-hours-of-sleep-whats-the-ideal-amount-and-why-it-might-not-be-what-you-think/articleshow/123118501.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;7 vs 9 hours of sleep: What’s the ideal amount and why it might not be what you think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to consult a professional&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If sleep difficulties persist despite following these habits, it may be time to consult a healthcare provider. Persistent issues could indicate conditions such as insomnia, sleep apnea, or other underlying health problems that need professional evaluation and targeted treatment to improve sleep quality and overall well-being. Early intervention can prevent complications and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small, science-backed changes to your evening routine can significantly improve deep, restorative sleep. By dimming lights, limiting screens, establishing a calming pre-sleep routine, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, optimising your bedroom environment, and paying attention to diet and exercise, you can help your brain enter the deep sleep phase more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep is more than just hours spent in bed; it’s about achieving the restorative deep sleep that supports overall health, metabolic function, and cognitive performance. Prioritising these habits allows you to wake up feeling refreshed, energised, and ready to take on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

                                        &lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A regulator has approved a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/koala-chlamydia-vaccinations-australia-f0a3e0a7d465dfa5ae0005f414bf6c29"&gt;world-first vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to protect koalas from chlamydia infections, which are causing infertility and death in the iconic native species that is listed as endangered in parts of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent approval by Australia’s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation’s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“We knew a single-dose vaccine — with no need for a booster — was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,” Timms said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,” Timms added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“At the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It’s just ridiculous,” Tabart said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabart’s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“I accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they’re sick because they haven’t got any habitat,” Tabart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queensland Conservation Council, an umbrella organization for more than 50 environmental groups across the state, welcomed the vaccine. But the council’s director, Dave Copeman, echoed Tabart’s focus on preserving koala habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really good news. Chlamydia is one of the key stresses that has been putting pressure on koala populations,” Copeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Koalas were at risk before chlamydia outbreaks, and they will remain at risk even if we manage chlamydia perfectly, because we keep on destroying their habitat,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koalas are &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-australian-capital-territory-new-south-wales-queensland-environment-f38e062d7ae4806f9d4f7f67dd538968"&gt;listed as endangered species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the states of Queensland and New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory, with habitat loss due to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-30c1bc2deec7a64735a366745825c70e"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and urban expansion as the major threats. Chlamydia can cause urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with antibiotics can disrupt an infected koala’s ability to digest eucalyptus leaves — its sole food source — leading to starvation, the university said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The research has been supported by the federal, New South Wales and Queensland governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt said his government had contributed to the vaccine’s development through a 76 million Australian dollar ($50 million) Saving Koalas Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that koalas need help to fight diseases like chlamydia. It’s a widespread threat impacting their reproductive health and causing infertility,” Watt said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials, like &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/baby-wombat-american-influencer-australia-marsupial-cube-poop-d97862f5a9b86dbacc1293e2a8adc9f9"&gt;wombats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/kangaroos"&gt;kangaroos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping in eucalyptus trees, and their paws have two opposing thumbs to help them grasp and climb up tree trunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s wild koala populations have declined steeply in the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing compounded threats from disease, habitat loss, climate change and road collisions, koalas could become extinct by 2050, according to a 2020 assessment from the New South Wales government.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3200132/"&gt;Appendix cancer&lt;/a&gt; is a condition that, until recently, was so rare that most people never gave it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, it was the kind of disease that doctors might encounter only once or twice in a career, and it was almost always found in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/appendix-cancers-rise-younger-generations-study-finds-rcna211796"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; a surprising and concerning trend is emerging: &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;appendix cancer is being diagnosed more often&lt;/a&gt;, and it's increasingly affecting people in their 30s, 40s and even younger. This shift has left many experts puzzled and searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-pooping-habits-could-harm-your-health-in-7-ways-research-shows"&gt;Your Pooping Habits Could Harm Your Health in 7 Ways, Research Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine. Its purpose in the body is &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Why-do-Humans-have-an-Appendix.aspx"&gt;still debated&lt;/a&gt;, but it's best known for causing appendicitis, a painful inflammation that often requires emergency surgery. What's less well known is that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="174031" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; can develop in the appendix, usually without any warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, has shown that the number of appendix cancer cases has increased dramatically among people born after the 1970s. In fact, the incidence has tripled or even quadrupled in younger generations compared with those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall numbers are still small (appendix cancer affects just a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9418812/#:%7E:text=Overall%2C%20the%20incidence%20of%20appendiceal,5.1%20to%2011.2%20per%20cent."&gt;handful of people&lt;/a&gt; per million each year) the rapid rise is striking. Even more notable is that about one in three cases now occurs in adults under 50, a much higher proportion than seen in other types of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's behind this surge? &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/vitamin-d-colon-cancer-b2744234.html"&gt;No one knows for sure&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the first suspects is the dramatic change in lifestyle and environment over the past several decades. Obesity rates have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3543235/"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s, and being overweight is a known risk factor for many cancers, including those of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, diets have shifted toward more processed foods, sugary drinks, and red or processed meats, all of which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; in other &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;parts of the gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has also &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, with more people spending long hours sitting at desks or in front of screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that we are being exposed to new environmental factors that previous generations didn't face. The industrialisation of food production, the widespread use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39518141/"&gt;plastics and chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, and changes in water quality might all play a role. However, the evidence is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167729" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water.jpg" alt="water pouring from tap into glass" class="size-full wp-image-167729" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/glass-of-water-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167729" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes in water quality might play a role in appendix cancer cases increasing. (pixelshot/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard to detect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes appendix cancer especially challenging is how difficult it is to detect. Unlike colon cancer, which can sometimes be found early through screening colonoscopies, appendix cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094592/"&gt;usually flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms, if they appear at all, are vague and easy to dismiss. People might experience mild abdominal pain, bloating or changes in bowel habits, which are common complaints for many benign conditions. As a result, most cases are only discovered after surgery for suspected appendicitis, when it's often too late for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in cases, there is no routine screening test for appendix cancer. The disease is simply too rare to justify widespread screening, and the appendix can be difficult to visualise with standard imaging or endoscopy. This means that both patients and doctors need to be extra vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone experiences persistent or unusual abdominal symptoms, especially if they're under 50, it's important not to ignore them. Early investigation and prompt treatment can make a significant difference in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in appendix cancer among younger adults is part of a broader trend seen in other gastrointestinal cancers, such as those of the colon and stomach. These cancers, too, are being diagnosed more often in people under 50, suggesting that shared risk factors may be at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this shift are complex and probably involve a mix of genetics, lifestyle, environment and perhaps even changes in our &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; – the bacteria in our intestines that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882224/"&gt;live with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, antibiotics have been used more frequently, both in medicine and in agriculture. This widespread use can alter the balance of bacteria in our guts, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7916407/"&gt;might influence cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests that early-life exposure to antibiotics could have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;long-term effects on the digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, but more studies are needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg" alt="Different types of tablets or pills in foil packs" class="size-full wp-image-164410" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-484x415.jpg 484w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-600x514.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could early-life exposure to antibiotics have something to do with the rise in appendix cancer? (PublicDomainPictures/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the best advice is to focus on prevention and awareness. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and staying physically active are all steps that can lower the risk of many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake are also &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;. While these measures can't guarantee protection against appendix cancer, they are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;proven strategies&lt;/a&gt; for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working hard to unravel the mystery of why appendix cancer is rising so rapidly among younger generations. Understanding the causes will be crucial for developing better ways to prevent, detect and treat this rare but increasingly important disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, raising awareness among healthcare providers and the public is essential. By recognising the signs and taking action when symptoms arise, we can improve the chances of catching appendix cancer early and giving patients the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-kissing-bug-disease-is-on-the-rise-across-the-us-cdc-warns"&gt;Deadly Kissing Bug Disease Is on The Rise Across The US, CDC Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of appendix cancer's rise is a reminder that even rare diseases can become more common when our environment and lifestyles change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a call to action for further research and for all of us to pay attention to our bodies, seek medical advice when something feels off, and support efforts to understand and combat this puzzling trend.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258607/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

"We saw Danish patients out of their own pocket paying for tickets to China to get all sorts of treatments – endangering their health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some went to private hospitals in Germany that offered new treatments unavailable in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Back then, Denmark's record on cancer was low compared to that of other rich countries. But so was the UK's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;From 1995 to 1999, Denmark's five-year survival rate for rectal cancer was essentially tied with the UK's, on around 48%, according to the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, a research body. It put both nations well below countries like Australia, which had a 59% rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Now, thanks to a bold plan, Denmark's performance on cancer has jumped ahead. By 2014, its five-year survival rate for rectal cancer had risen to 69%, close to Australia's. (The UK's rose too, but only to 62%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Analysts think the trend has probably continued (though these are the most up-to-date figures available). And it's a similar story for other cancers, including colon, stomach, and lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This Danish success story has caught the attention of UK policymakers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting says that aspects of the Danish model are feeding into government plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some could well be included in a new long-term cancer plan for England, due to be published in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So, what's their secret, and can the NHS learn from Denmark?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Big investments and thoughtful touches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Walking today into Herlev Hospital on the outskirts of Copenhagen makes for a rather different experience to arriving at an average NHS hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The foyer is hung with bright, vivid paintings by the Danish artist Poul Gernes.

Along with introducing new equipment, and rethinking the atmosphere of hospitals, they also made it possible for patients to be treated with chemotherapy at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;New national standards govern how quickly Danes must be treated: following a referral, a cancer diagnosis has to be given within two weeks. Then, if treatment is required, it has to start within the two weeks of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If these targets are not met patients have the right to transfer to another hospital - or, failing that, another country - whilst still being funded by the Danish health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is quite a contrast to the UK nations.

Addressing this, she says, should improve the quality of cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"That means clarity over who in the government and NHS is responsible for delivering each part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Ultimately, responsibility for the success or failure of the plan should rest with the health and social care secretary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She points out that there are similarities between England and Denmark's state-run health systems - for example, the roughly similar amount they spend on health as a share of national income, meaning Denmark's example could be followed in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But this would require a long-term plan, political leadership, higher investment, more cancer screening, and stronger targets.

Alcohol consumption is similar in both nations, though obesity levels in Denmark are lower and smoking rates are higher. (One Danish health leader told me that they were envious of UK initiatives on smoking, with the minimum age for tobacco sales rising each year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, there are certain challenges specific to the UK: the population of England, for example, is nearly 10 times larger than Denmark's population. And the NHS is a complex organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Still, ministers have made no secret of their interest in the Danish system, with an official visit earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Wes Streeting, the UK Health Secretary, says: "Denmark's healthcare system is known the world over for its excellence, having transformed outcomes through its cancer plans, and Health Minister Karin Smyth's trip to the country earlier this year offered us vital insights up close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Streeting says these insights have "fed into" government health plans to "speed up cancer diagnoses and deliver cutting edge treatments to the NHS front line quicker".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Michelle Mitchell of Cancer Research UK agrees that Denmark offers a useful template. "They are diagnosing cancer earlier, people are surviving longer, more people are taking up screening – all of those factors as well as investment in workforce and kit are critical components of a cancer plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She argues that British health ministers could move towards Danish-style national waiting time targets rather than the UK's current system of "benchmarks", which are weaker and haven't been met since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'This is unfinished business'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The greater challenge for the NHS though, is that there are so many other problems - crowded A&amp;amp;E departments, overstretched staff and, as one analyst put it, "multiple fires burning" - meaning that it can be difficult to persuade health leaders to focus on cancer survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ruth Thorlby, assistant director of policy at The Health Foundation think tank, says that policymakers in London and Copenhagen both realised at the same time, in the 1990s, that cancer needed urgent attention and urgent plans were drawn up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But whilst Danish policymakers saw policies through, she argues that in the UK the momentum "dissipated", as other priorities and short-term problems emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This is unfinished business - over the last decade there has been a move away from cancer plans," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3da3/live/0b535cf0-8f00-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="PA Wire A member of staff on a NHS hospital ward" class="sc-86c96223-0 fHZDyi"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-86c96223-2 hqrvRC"&gt;PA Wire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Ruth Thorlby says that while Denmark stuck with its cancer plans, the UK lost momentum as other priorities took over&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At the heart of Denmark's success was a sense of political consensus. From the 1990s onwards, figures from all major parties agreed that cancer should be a priority. This is a level of agreement the UK has not managed to reach, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Fisker of the Danish Cancer Society argues that the usual cut-and-thrust of party politics needs to be set aside. "Politicians must promise each other there is going to be a long, lasting partnership. And health leaders need to operate on a 10-, 15-, 20-year basis," he says - longer than the life of any one government or party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But does he think that's possible in the UK? After all, Westminster is not known for much long-term, cross-party thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"If you are really decisive, if you really want to do this and are committed to it over a period of time, and you are also ready to invest then I think it can be done," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;With a pause, he adds: "Nothing comes without investment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-indepth" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;BBC InDepth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-and-we-showcase-thought-provoking-content-from-across-bbc-sounds-and-iplayer-too.-you-can-send-us-your-feedback-on-the-indepth-section-by-clicking-on-the-button-below." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

            A school-age child in Los Angeles County who had measles as an infant has died of a rare complication, the county health department said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600053b6q3x6tc176@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The child was infected before they were eligible to receive the measles vaccine, the agency says; the first vaccination is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; between 12 months and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between ages 4 and 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600063b6q4j4n8gy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They recovered from that infection but developed a condition called subacute sclerosing panenecephalitis, which affects about 1 in 10,000 unvaccinated people who get measles overall but up to 1 in 600 of those who catch the virus in infancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600073b6qyeur2xil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;SSPE&lt;/a&gt;, as the complication is also known, develops years after measles infection and can cause changes in personality or behavior, problems with speech and motor functions, and epilepsy, followed by a vegetative state. There’s no cure, and it’s fatal in about 95% of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp6000b3b6qw53g0esd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States has had 1,454 measles cases this year, more than at any other point since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600083b6q6iizuybt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that the child’s case is “a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp600093b6q9mxcsj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine are highly effective against measles, preventing 97% of infections. Experts recommend that at least 95% of a community be vaccinated to prevent the disease’s spread, but immunization rates have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/health/vaccine-preventable-diseases-pertussis-polio"&gt;falling&lt;/a&gt; across the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmffzhzp6000a3b6q597efcj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Infants younger than six months are too young to be vaccinated and rely on maternal antibodies and community immunity to reduce their risk of exposure,” the Los Angeles County Health Department said in the statement. “By getting vaccinated, individuals not only protect themselves but also help shield vulnerable populations — including infants, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems — from measles infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Jason Mitton wanted one of the new COVID-19 vaccines before leaving on a business trip. But the pharmacists at a drug store near his home in Austin, Texas, refused.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He's like: 'Do you have a doctor's note?' I said: 'No, I don't.' He said: 'Well, the FDA standards say that you don't qualify. And our policy is that we won't administer it unless you qualify,'" says Mitton. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mitton, who's 55 and says he has high blood pressure and high cholesterol that's controlled by medication, plans to keep trying to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's ridiculous," Mitton says. "I think it should be a person's right to get the vaccine or not. So I'm very angry."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The same goes for Cheryl Huges, 64, who lives outside Cleveland. She was planning to get another shot as soon as the updated versions became available. But, she's not eligible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm furious," says Hughes. "Who wants to get sick?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For the first time, COVID vaccines aren't available to anyone ages 6 months and older to obtain simply by walking into a pharmacy and asking to get inoculated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a major departure, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;only approved the shots&lt;/a&gt; for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID because they're at least 65 years old or have another health issue that makes them highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration health officials argue that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many Americans who don't meet the new criteria do still want to get vaccinated to avoid getting sick or spreading the virus to vulnerable family members.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And independent medical organizations like the Infectious Disease Society of America argue that &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/fdas-narrow-covid-19-vaccine-label-ignores-science-and-puts-millions-of-lives-at-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;everyone should have the option&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated because there is convincing evidence that the vaccines reduce the risk of serious complications, including hospitalization and death, even for people who are otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Hughes wants to remain healthy so she can care for her husband, who has dementia. She's his only caretaker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If I get sick, my husband might have to go into a care facility. I could lose my job. It would be terrible," Hughes says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What it takes to get the shot&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Secretary Kennedy has repeatedly claimed the new rules won't prevent anyone from getting vaccinated if they want to.  But many people have told NPR that they are having trouble. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In principle, you can still get vaccinated if you meet the criteria, get a doctor to prescribe a shot, or if you "self attest" that you're eligible by telling the pharmacist you meet the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But sometimes people are turned away because supplies of the reformulated shots haven't arrived yet. Sometimes it's because they didn't meet the new criteria. Or they're told they can get a shot if they get a prescription first, only to be inexplicably rejected anyway when they return with a doctor's order.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people describe hunting for a shot from pharmacy to pharmacy and doctor's office to doctor's office — even sometimes seeking one out of state.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The companies that make the shots, Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax, didn't say exactly how many doses they were making this year, given the narrower FDA approvals. But Pfizer says it is preparing "similar volumes" as last year, and that it's confident it will meet demand. It also says millions of doses have already shipped.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Claire Hannan, &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/claire-hannan/" target="_blank"&gt;the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;, says she doesn't expect vaccine supply to be a problem. She says pharmacies are able to order the COVID shots and they've been shipped out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's going to be harder to access," she says. "But I think anybody that wants it, you know, will be able to get it. But they're just going to have to work hard to find it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some clinics and pharmacies haven't received the supplies they've ordered yet. And some doctors' offices, including pediatricians, and clinics may decide not to stock the shots this year if they don't expect enough demand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you're trying to find one, Pfizer and &lt;a href="https://products.modernatx.com/finder" target="_blank"&gt;Moderna &lt;/a&gt;both have &lt;a href="https://www.vaxassist.com/schedule?cmp=188442362390&amp;amp;utm_source=GOOGLE&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;amp;pid=Scheduler&amp;amp;utm_term=pfizer%20vaccine%20available%20near%20me&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22943851190&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABK5w6FawaR8GMs9_iPQ0cImTHd-Y&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5onGBhDeARIsAFK6QJYqqC3A_jZAbNDWf_hifoXY60dX6YR_LiYEEicIdMfLaYWnOJpbL7gaAruoEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine-finder websites&lt;/a&gt; up and running.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Waiting for the CDC's guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major snag is that pharmacists in some states are prohibited from administering the shots until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues specific recommendations for who should get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In past years, those recommendations came in the spring. But Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the entire &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;, the independent group that formulates those recommendations, and replaced the members with his own advisers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's new committee is finally scheduled to meet next week about the COVID vaccines and other issues. That could alleviate some of the problems, including hesitancy that some pharmacists and doctors have because of the changing rules and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it remains unclear what the advisers will do. They could make it easier, or harder, for people to get a shot. Many of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee" target="_blank"&gt;committee's new members&lt;/a&gt; share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Either way, until the committee meeting happens, the shots that are part of the Vaccines for Children Program won't ship, says Hannan, who explained that people haven't been able to order them yet. About half of kids in the U.S. are eligible for free vaccines through the program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health insurance coverage could also prove tricky. Although Aetna and United Healthcare told NPR they will cover the COVID shot with no cost sharing for people with fully insured plans — even for people outside the FDA's narrower approval — it's not clear what other insurance companies will do. And even people who have Aetna or United could have other kinds&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of plans that don't cover the shot, which could set patients back around $200.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Fears for vulnerable family members, kids&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, many Americans have been scrambling to try to figure out how to still get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm very angry, frustrated," says Allison Cote, 32, of Bristol, Conn.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cote wants to stay well to protect her father, who has heart failure, other family members who have diabetes, and one relative who recently got a kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's also concerned about her 16-month-old son. He's not eligible to get vaccinated either this year, even though COVID can be very dangerous for babies. The new shots are only approved for children who have conditions that put them at high risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In fact, the CDC this spring &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;dropped recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that children and pregnant women routinely get vaccinated. For children, the agency recommends parents talk to their doctors first about vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just really upsetting," Cote says. "Why do I have to jump through hoops to do this? It's kind of scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If she has to, Cote says she may do what some people are doing: just say she's eligible. But she doesn't feel great about that. And she has no idea how to get a shot for her baby boy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's hard to watch this play out and know that there are so many lives at risk — and potentially my son's life is at risk too," Cote says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stephan Neidenbach, 45, a public school teacher from Annapolis, Md., is frustrated and angry too. He's worried about getting sick and spreading the virus to his students, his elderly parents or his mother-in-law, who has lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would feel horrible if I did get it and if I passed it off to someone that I cared about. It's terrifying," Neidenbach says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's considering fibbing about his eligibility to get a shot too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Therese McRae, 37, of Sandy, Utah, also wants to get vaccinated. Her main motivation is to protect her 4-year-old daughter, who has Type 1 diabetes, which puts her at risk for serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Being a parent of a young child with a complex medical diagnosis is hard enough," McRae says. "Having folks around her not being able to be vaccinated increases her risk. It's just very overwhelming. It's scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karen Lambey, 43, who lives near Richmond, Va., desperately wants a vaccine too. She says she became immunocompromised after developing long COVID. Her pharmacist told her she needed a prescription to get the shot and she hasn't been able to find a doctor to give her one.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Any sort of flu, COVID, would set me back significantly," Lambey says. "These are all extra hurdles that keep adding up. I feel disappointed because this is something that is important to my health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And Lambey's parents are immune compromised too. She's afraid of spreading the virus to them.

          &lt;p&gt;A child in Los Angeles has died of a measles-related brain disorder stemming from an infection in infancy, &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135"&gt;the Los Angeles County health department reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the child died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare, but always fatal complication that strikes years after an initial measles infection. The health department's announcement offered few details about the child, including the child's age, but said that the child had contracted the virus before they were old enough to be vaccinated against measles. The first of two &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html"&gt;recommended doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is given between 12 and 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members," Muntu Davis, a Los Angeles County health officer, said in a statement. "Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity. Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself—it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSPE is caused by a persistent measles infection in the central nervous system. Children infected with the virus may go through the standard disease progression—flu-like symptoms, high fever, the telltale rash—and then appear to fully recover. But, for a small few, the virus remains and SSPE emerges years later, often seven to 10 years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles health department noted that SSPE generally affects about 1 in 10,000 people with measles, but the risk may be much higher—about 1 in 600—for those who get measles as infants, such as the child who recently died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With widespread vaccination, which led to measles being declared eliminated from the US in 2000, SSPE has virtually disappeared in the US. However, with vaccination rates slipping and anti-vaccine misinformation and views gripping the country, health experts fear seeing more of these devastating cases. Already, the US measles case count for the year is at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/measles-cases-reach-33-year-high-as-rfk-jr-pursues-anti-vaccine-agenda/"&gt;a 33-year high&lt;/a&gt;, and two other children, as well as an adult, died from the acute infection this year.&lt;/p&gt;

The first dose should be given to babies at 12 to 15 months, followed by a second at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e9c1df" class="body-graf"&gt;The child recovered, but years later developed &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-infection-symptoms-longterm-risks-rcna138583" target="_blank"&gt;a rare, progressive brain disorder&lt;/a&gt; known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), the department said. The condition can occur in people who had measles early in life, usually around 2 to 10 years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-819977" class="body-graf"&gt;“This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,” Dr. Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County health officer, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-533da8" class="body-graf"&gt;“Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself — it’s about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-779012" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1 in 10,000 people with measles later develop SSPE — but among those who are infected as infants, the risk is around 1 in 600, according to the Los Angeles health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b1ae8" class="body-graf"&gt;The condition affects the central nervous system, so people may experience seizures or lose the ability to walk before falling into a coma or vegetative state. There is no known cure or effective treatment for the disorder, and most patients die within one to three years of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ee997" class="body-graf"&gt;Nationally, measles vaccination rates have dipped in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm?s_cid=mm7341a3_w" target="_blank"&gt;Less than 93% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the United States received the recommended two doses during the 2023-24 school year (a rate of 95% is generally needed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;to curb the spread&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2441d" class="body-graf"&gt;This year marked the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;worst outbreak &lt;/a&gt;since the U.S. eliminated the disease in 2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recorded 1,454 cases&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the year, surpassing a previous record in 2019 driven by an outbreak in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Orthodox Jewish communities in New York&lt;/a&gt; with low vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-20c73f" class="body-graf"&gt;This year’s high case count was largely fueled by an outbreak in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/measles-outbreak-mennonites-west-texas-seminole-vaccines-rcna208284" target="_blank"&gt;a Mennonite community in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which also has low vaccination rates. Two unvaccinated children in the community died of measles earlier in the year, as did &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, marking the country’s first measles deaths in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-084b5b" class="body-graf"&gt;The Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;declared an end&lt;/a&gt; to the West Texas outbreak in mid-August, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;weekly cases in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; have generally declined since then. However, there are still ongoing outbreaks — including &lt;a href="https://dhhs.utah.gov/featured-news/measles-in-utah-sept-9-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;one at a Utah high school event&lt;/a&gt; — making measles a persistent threat to unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f9dad" class="body-graf"&gt;Two shots of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and typically offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3641be" class="body-graf"&gt;Public health experts say the challenge of getting measles under control this year has been &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;compounded by misinformation&lt;/a&gt; from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Though Kennedy has called for people to get the MMR vaccine, he has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;falsely claimed that immunity from the vaccine wanes quickly&lt;/a&gt;, framed vaccination as a personal choice and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasized unproven measles treatments&lt;/a&gt; such as steroids or antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41a56e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Kennedy also played up the role of vitamin A during the Texas outbreak, even though it’s not a treatment for the disease and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288" target="_blank"&gt;unclear how beneficial it is&lt;/a&gt; for patients outside of developing countries, where vitamin A deficiencies are common. Too much of it can also be harmful: Physicians in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that some unvaccinated patients showed signs of liver damage from taking vitamin A in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 21:28:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOQlREZmdXSV9nOEM1N0IzNVdfaWlMcHo3R1lUSDF0WUZJTER2YjY3aVU3d2JXbjZGdGFyQXRpR1p2SUc1N2JsZHZUX3h1MFI0RlpfZ3dTcHJ4ckdBdGZETl94YlZpeVJpajZOcUEtNU5PWXVBbUl1djE3XzR0YlNTdnk2bm5kU1pqamtKX1JxYjBzX1NBaVNFZE42TTNYNmpkbHJYQzJxTGtXNTdKejNROWlpYUdXZUROOXM1UGtvVWTSAVZBVV95cUxPOXpBV2UyWDZBWXZqNXdtWEp5LUtVeVZEaGJrOEpIVGFUdlVYcXNWZG9aTm5fR0dSQVZBeWFfdjZsQ0NyVVJCckpodmhTSm96Y2M0TFd2UQ</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的专家警告说，潜在致命的“接吻虫”疾病正在这里和整个美国蔓延- KHOU</title><link>https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/texas/kissing-bug-disease-texas-tamu-symptoms/285-8db6d154-60cd-488f-aa83-bd9500235d76</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;UT Health and Texas A&amp;amp;M participated in a CDC study on the bugs that can spread Chagas disease, which is becoming more prevalent here and in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising awareness that the potentially deadly &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/kissing-bug-disease-chagas-disease-now-endemic-in-us-researchers-say/507-6557279f-b15b-434c-b2be-2bc128d9e3fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Chagas disease &lt;/a&gt;is becoming more common in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/health/kissing-bug-cdc-warns-people-of-deadly-bug-that-is-native-to-indiana-triatominae-health-chagas-disease-spread-united-states-study-trypanosoma-cruzi/531-08b84741-e4a9-43c2-9665-039c4748a0bb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The disease is spread by blood-sucking insects&lt;/a&gt; called triatomines, better known as &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/indiana/cdc-warns-deadly-kissing-bugs-can-be-found-indiana/531-c4386e51-a18a-4fad-81b5-f9acfd082745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the "kissing bug&lt;/a&gt;" because they typically bite victims near the lips and eyes while they're sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 8 million people worldwide, including at least 280,000 people in the U.S. have Chagas disease. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people don't realize they have it because the symptoms mimic many other common conditions. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it isn't treated, Chagas can cause serious health problems and can even be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas is one of eight states that have reported human cases of Chagas disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/IDCU/disease/chagas/UT_Health_Kissing_Bug_Chagas_Guide-061918.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;UTHealth&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Texas A&amp;amp;M &lt;/a&gt;participated in a CDC study of the disease, which is already endemic in 21 countries in Central and South America. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Hamer, &lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/Resources/#media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;a veterinary epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt;, is among the researchers saying the time is now to recognize Chagas disease as endemic in the United States, as well.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This idea that this is only a disease that's to be encountered in Latin America, it's not accurate, and it doesn't reflect the transmission that occurs locally here in the United States to people and to animals,” Hamer said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Texas, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee have reported human cases of Chagas.   &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors in most states aren't required to track or report it.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is Chagas or kissing bug disease spread?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease typically spreads through contact with the feces of kissing bugs. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the bugs will bite and suck blood from infected animals or people. Then they become infected with the parasite. After biting, the bugs poop, and the poop has the parasite in it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the poop gets in someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC &lt;/a&gt;says people may rub the feces into a cut, their eyes or mouth without even knowing it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of kissing bugs are infected with Chagas,&lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; according to Texas A&amp;amp;M.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where are kissing bugs found? &lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood-sucking insects occur naturally in the southern half of the country and have been &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;reported in 32 U.S. states&lt;/a&gt; and Washington D.C., according to the CDC report. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/spreads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Those states include&lt;/a&gt;: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bugs can live indoors, in cracks and holes of substandard housing, or in a variety of outdoor settings, including:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beneath porches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Between rocky structures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under cement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In rock, wood, brush piles, or beneath bark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In rodent nests or animal burrows&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In outdoor dog houses or kennels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In chicken coops or houses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Chagas or kissing bug disease&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease has two stages: the acute phase and the chronic phase. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the acute phase happens in the first weeks or months after getting infected. The chronic phase can last years or even for a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms during the acute phase are usually mild and can include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eyelid swelling, known as&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7660534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Romaña's sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people have no symptoms during the chronic phase; however, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC &lt;/a&gt;says 20-30% of people infected will develop "serious health problems." They include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart issues, such as an enlarged heart, heart failure, altered heart rate or rhythm, or sudden death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Digestive problems, such as an enlarged esophagus or colon, can lead to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing any symptoms, contact your healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is kissing bug disease treatable?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease can be treated with the use of antiparasitics, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20356218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Chronic symptoms will have to be managed with other treatment methods. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known cure for Chagas disease. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kissing bug in dogs&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Texas A&amp;amp;M University have found Chagas disease in dogs in many counties in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common signs of illness in infected dogs are heart problems, stomach issues, and sometimes sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many infected dogs don't have symptoms, but their daily stress and activity level, along with age, may affect how sick they get. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working on new treatments for Chagas disease in dogs. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no vaccination that protects against Chagas disease in humans or dogs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of 'kissing bugs' in Texas&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seven species of kissing bugs in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adult kissing bugs range in size, but are usually about the size of a U.S. quarter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most species have a characteristic band around the sides of the body that is either orange or red. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The legs of kissing bugs are long and thin; unlike similar insects, the legs are thin throughout the rounded bottom. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kissing bugs have noticeable mouthparts that appear as a large black needle attached to the head; when tucked under the body, the needle-like mouthpart is completely straight. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kissing bugs are slightly flat and have very long, thin heads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Kissing bug nymphs (immature, young insects) are smaller than adults and range from the size of a poppy seed to almost 1 inch long. They have a ‘tear-drop’ body shape, with a pointy head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;I used to assume late diners were just disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Then I started paying attention—on work trips to Barcelona, in New York kitchens at 10:15 p.m., at my own desk on deadline nights—and realized the story is more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Many people who eat late aren’t chaotic at all — they’re living inside different body clocks, social rhythms, and coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Psychology has language for this—chronotypes, social jetlag, self-regulation bandwidth—and once you see those patterns, the “why are you eating so late?” conversation gets a lot more compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;Below are 7 traits I see repeatedly in after-9 p.m. eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="887"&gt;None of them are moral grades. They’re clues—and a few are genuine advantages—about how these folks move through time, work, creativity, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="889" data-end="944"&gt;1. They’re night-owls by chronotype, not by accident&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;Some bodies simply hit their cognitive and physical stride later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;If your internal clock (chronotype) runs “evening,” your alertness curve peaks when early birds are winding down, and your hunger naturally drifts later too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;That’s not laziness — it’s biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104160801100080X"&gt;Research on morningness–eveningness&lt;/a&gt; shows stable, partly genetic differences in when people &lt;em data-start="1296" data-end="1304"&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to sleep, work, and eat. Late diners are often aligning dinner with their true wakefulness window, not fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;Practically, that means a 9:30 p.m. plate may feel like someone else’s 6:30 p.m.—socially late, biologically right-on-time. If you’ve tried (and failed) to become a 6 p.m. eater, consider that you may be playing against your clock, not your willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="945" data-end="1784"&gt;The smarter move is to build routines that respect the body you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1786" data-end="1870"&gt;2. They trade prime early-evening hours for flow, then eat when the brain lets go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;Another common thread: late diners often protect the 6–9 p.m. block for something that genuinely matters—deep work after the emails stop, a rehearsal, a second wind of exercise, or social time that refuels them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;In other words, dinner is a rewarded landing, not a starting gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;This sequencing is psychological as much as logistical. When your best concentration shows up late, you stack tasks in that window and let food follow. It can look odd from the outside, but it’s how flow states get protected in busy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;If this is you, consider a small, protein-forward snack around 5–6 p.m. to keep blood sugar steady while you chase the thing that needs your best brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1871" data-end="2634"&gt;Your main plate at 9:30 p.m. will feel like a calm exhale instead of a frantic raid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2636" data-end="2724"&gt;3. They’re synchronizers—choosing people over clocks (and navigating “social jetlag”)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;Plenty of late eaters aren’t personally nocturnal; they’re scheduling to the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;The partner’s shift ends at nine; the teenager gets home from practice at eight-thirty — friends meet after a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;You choose connection, and dinner slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;Psychology calls the mismatch between biological time and social time &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334439104_Chronotype_and_Social_Jetlag_A_Self-_Critical_Review"&gt;social jetlag&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s most pronounced in evening types who live on early-bird schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;That tug-of-war shows up at mealtimes, too. The upside: late eaters are often &lt;em data-start="3212" data-end="3232"&gt;relationship-first&lt;/em&gt;; they prioritize bonding over perfect timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;The watch-out is chronic misalignment (always eating on your “biological midnight”) which can leave you foggier the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2725" data-end="3626"&gt;If you’re constantly dining by committee, small nudges help—morning light exposure, consistent wake times, and keeping the very late meals to truly social nights, not every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3628" data-end="3707"&gt;4. They skew creative and novelty-seeking (and their spark turns on at dusk)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;A fun—and often overlooked—pattern: evening types tend to show stronger creativity and comfort with novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ijip.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/18.01.092.20190702-1.pdf"&gt;Several studies&lt;/a&gt; link later chronotypes with divergent thinking and idea generation, and with personality profiles that tilt a bit more toward openness and a bit less toward rigid conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;If your spark shows up at 8:45 p.m., dinner naturally drifts because the mind is busy making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;That doesn’t make you flaky; it makes you someone whose &lt;em data-start="4173" data-end="4185"&gt;best ideas&lt;/em&gt; happen off-peak. The trick is designing food around that gift—prep components earlier, keep a “late creative plate” on standby (soup, beans + greens, tofu you can sear in five), and land the meal without breaking the spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3708" data-end="4507"&gt;Your life gets easier when your kitchen respects your muse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4509" data-end="4564"&gt;5. Their self-control rhythm is different—not weaker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;By 7 p.m., lots of people are out of decision-making gas. Late eaters often budget willpower differently: they spend it on the project, the class, the rehearsal, the extra shift—and push the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;To an early diner, that reads like “no discipline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;To a psychologist, it looks like an alternative allocation of self-regulation: saying yes to delayed gratification (finish the thing) and then yes to food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;What helps is removing friction from that last step so hunger doesn’t turn into a raid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;Think defaults: a set of three go-to late dinners, a pre-chopped veg box, or a ready grain that cooks while you shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4565" data-end="5327"&gt;You’re not changing your wiring — you’re smoothing the landing for 9:30 p.m. dinner isn’t a bag of chips but something that actually restores you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5329" data-end="5389"&gt;6. Their hunger and metabolism cues genuinely shift later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;Here’s where biology gets blunt: &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2822%2900397-7"&gt;timing changes physiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;In a rigorous crossover study that controlled for calories, sleep, and activity, late eating (same food, later time) increased hunger, reduced energy expenditure, and shifted fat-tissue gene expression toward storing rather than burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;Translation: when you push meals late—especially habitually—you may feel hungrier and burn slightly fewer calories during the day, independent of what you ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;That doesn’t make late dinner “bad,” but it does explain why some people feel snack-y after dark or groggy the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5390" data-end="6320"&gt;Useful tweaks: pull protein and fiber earlier into the day, keep late plates lighter and closer to two hours before bed, and get bright light soon after waking to firm up your clock. Small changes can defend sleep and mood without forcing a 6 p.m. dinner you’ll never keep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6322" data-end="6369"&gt;7. They adapt to culture and city—on purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;Finally, environment matters. In many Mediterranean and Latin cultures, late dinner is the norm; social life blooms after sunset, and the plaza fills when an American suburb goes quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;Even within the same country, urban schedules run later than suburban ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;Late diners are often context-savvy: they eat when their world eats. That adaptation can be deeply human (more face time, cooler temperatures, community) even if it clashes with a textbook circadian ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;If you live in a late-eating culture or city, you can still protect health with consistency (regular dinner time, not a ping-pong), earlier daylight, and a solid lunch so dinner doesn’t turn into a midnight feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6370" data-end="7188"&gt;The point isn’t to fight your context — it’s to make it work for your body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7195" data-end="7213"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;People who eat after 9 p.m. aren’t a monolith. Some are artists coming off a late rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;Some are parents waiting to eat with kids after practice. Some are simply night-owls who feel most alive after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;The thread running through these lives isn’t irresponsibility; it’s alignment—to a clock, a community, a craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;If your plate lands late and you feel fine, you probably built systems around it: earlier light, steady sleep, not-enormous portions, and a lunch that pulls real weight. If you &lt;em data-start="7717" data-end="7724"&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; feel fine, you don’t need a personality transplant—just a few nudges toward your biology: brighter mornings, more protein by noon, and a dinner that respects both your calendar and your clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7214" data-end="8051"&gt;The goal isn’t to pass a 6 p.m. purity test — it’s to wake up clear and go to bed satisfied, whatever time your life sits down to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3ex000h3b79n86jgyf3@published"&gt;My younger sister “Harper” just shared with me that she and her husband are excited to be expecting a baby. She told me she was only telling our parents and a few trusted family members and asked me to help her keep the news secret until after the baby is born!&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffss94b000s3b79dk4domyr@published"&gt;I knew immediately that this was because of our older sister “Ronnie.” Ronnie and her husband have struggled with infertility for years. After 10 miscarriages, Ronnie has reached a point where she will not be in the same room with a pregnant woman or a baby if she can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfft8a1u001a3b792njzbkxk@published"&gt;Harper also told me that she is also going to forgo having a baby shower “out of respect for what Ronnie is going through.” I think this is insane.&lt;/p&gt;

Should I tell Ronnie about Harper’s pregnancy, and tell her it’s time to suck it up and shut up?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3le000k3b79xrvdat9p@published"&gt;I’m not sure why Harper believes it will be any easier for Ronnie to learn about her baby after its birth as opposed to before. But Harper’s pregnancy is her business—it’s her choice who she wants to tell about it, and when. Maybe she wants to enjoy her happy news (assuming she is happy about it) for as long as possible before dealing with Ronnie’s potential feelings about it. In any case, while I know it’s an awkward situation—and it feels weird to know something important about your sister that your other sister doesn’t know—I do think you should probably leave it to Harper to share the news as she sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3n8000l3b79k9zllmp5@published"&gt;I realize you probably wouldn’t tell her in so many words to “suck it up and shut up.” Still, when you phrase it as her holding “the world hostage” and say that she doesn’t have the right to make Harper forgo any joy or celebration, you are overlooking the fact that Ronnie isn’t &lt;em&gt;forcing &lt;/em&gt;Harper to do anything. Obviously it’s not realistic if Ronnie expects to get through life without ever seeing pregnant people and babies. But you don’t know that that’s her plan—sometimes there are things we do to try to take care of ourselves while actively grieving that we don’t necessarily do forever.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3p2000m3b79mfdu6ktd@published"&gt;Right now, Ronnie is grieving. That is affecting her and her relationships and your family in many ways. It’s okay for you to feel upset or sad or frustrated about that. But Ronnie didn’t choose to experience so many losses, and the timeline of her grieving and healing is not up to you. In the meantime, she hasn’t asked Harper not to have a baby shower “out of respect” for her; she doesn’t even know about the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3r1000n3b796vl8r8a1@published"&gt;Whether before or after the birth, your sisters are going to have to figure this out. If the secrecy right now bothers you, you can gently encourage Harper to be open with Ronnie before the baby arrives. (She might not really be “protecting” Ronnie, after all—Ronnie might be even more hurt knowing that Harper felt she couldn’t tell her about the pregnancy.) I don’t know how close your sisters are, but if Harper loves Ronnie enough to forgo a baby shower to try to protect her feelings, maybe they are close enough to talk about this and come to some sort of genuine, if inevitably complicated, understanding—one that allows them to be honest with each other, acknowledging both Harper’s happiness and Ronnie’s pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsn81c00axw7kvovsu79ka@published"&gt;I am a happily married middle-aged woman with two girls, “Bailey” (16) and “Sera” (14). They are great sisters. They get along fine for their age, and they enjoy playing video games and reading books together. Bailey is extraordinarily patient with Sera’s anti-social nature, and they share everything together. My husband and I made the decision to homeschool them when Bailey was in first grade, and they are both ahead academically. They also have a great relationship with my husband and me, and although our circle is small, we are happy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/01/mother-in-law-shot-childs-confidence-comparison-advice.html"&gt;However, we’re experiencing some academic drama as of late.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of these cases, 490 are neuroinvasive, meaning they are severe cases impacting the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is the leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mosquito-borne disease&lt;/a&gt; in the continental U.S. While it primarily infects people during mosquito season in the summer and fall, experts have warned a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/climate-change/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;warming climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; means &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mosquito-season-getting-longer-more-disease-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;mosquito season is getting longer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, prompting greater potential for the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Massachusetts recently announced two additional human cases, the state's public health commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein encouraged the public to stay vigilant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infections can continue to occur until the first hard frost of the season, which is likely still many weeks away," Goldstein said in &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-additional-human-cases-of-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;. "We are encouraging everyone to continue to take the necessary steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites, including by using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants to reduce exposed skin, and to drain anything that may be collecting water outside your home."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed West Nile cases nationwide as new data is released by ArboNET, a national arboviral surveillance system managed by CDC and state health departments. (The map below is updated bi-weekly on Tuesdays when the  latest data is released.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Nile virus symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A West Nile virus infection often leads to flu-like symptoms, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aches and pains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash (occasionally)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Less than about 1 in 150 people who get infected get a more serious form, and that involves the central nervous system," CBS News chief medical correspondent &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/west-nile-virus-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Jon LaPook said last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In those more severe cases, "You get inflammation of the brain, and this the the membrane that lines the spinal cord, and that's a much more serious situation there." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people infected with the virus do not develop symptoms, according to the CDC, but for those who do, symptoms usually start about 2-6 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, though in some cases, it may be up to 14 days. "It may take longer for symptoms to start for people with a weakened immune system," the agency notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment available for West Nile virus, so health experts say it's important to focus on prevention, like the precautions Goldstein shared to reduce the risk of mosquito bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting yourself is especially important for people who are more at risk, including the elderly and those immunocompromised, LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;From a tender wrapper of human life, the placenta, comes the extraction of a protein that points to a solution for something that, until now, science had no clear path toâ€”and never one so celebrated: restoring the spinal cord in people who suffered injuries and lost body movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian researcher Tatiana Coelho de Sampaio, PhD professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, has quietly worked with a team of biologists for the past 25 years on the repairing and multiplying power of the protein laminin, which acts on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies ultimately produced the current drug polylaminin, a world first, presented on Tuesday (9) by CristÃ¡lia laboratory as capable of regenerating the spinal cord in people who suffered organ rupture in accidents of various kinds, leading to paraplegiaâ€”paralysis of the lower limbsâ€”or quadriplegiaâ€”paralysis of both lower and upper limbs.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;During the experimental phase of the antidote, which is applied directly to the spine, patients experienced full recovery of their conditions, with no aftereffects and resuming a routine without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — The number of suspected Ebola cases in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/democratic-republic-of-the-congo"&gt;Congo’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; southern Kasai province have &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-kasai-outbreak-73c01a467e3f7b5e3e19abec17c65a39"&gt;more than doubled in a week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since a new outbreak was confirmed there, Africa’s top public health agency said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspected cases have increased from 28 to 68 in recent days, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at an online briefing. It has also spread from two to four districts while the death toll currently stands at 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local residents expressed concerns on Thursday over the outbreak, the first in Congo in three years and the province’s first in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kasai province is a remote part of Congo with poor road networks and is more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the nation’s capital of Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-m23-rebels-rwanda-explainer-ba862f76078ab0a4fcd24502612ab602"&gt;fighting in eastern Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could complicate efforts to contain the disease, which can spread rapidly due to the proximity and density of villages and provinces, Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, a principal advisor with Africa CDC, said at the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“It was two (districts), now it is four,” Ngongo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593"&gt;outbreak was announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a week ago after a pregnant woman was confirmed to have been infected in the locality of Bulapé.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization sent experts alongside Congo’s Rapid Response Team to Kasai to strengthen disease surveillance, offer treatment and monitor infection prevention and controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central African country has a history of Ebola since 1976. The latest outbreak is the 16th in the country and the 7th in the Kasai province. A previous outbreak between 2018 and 2020 in eastern Congo killed more than 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Local authorities in Kasai are trying to contain the outbreak. Public movements have been curtailed and checkpoints have been set up at the main entrances to Tshikapa, the capital of the province, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel Kalonji, 37, a resident of Tshikapa, told The Associated Press that some people had fled the villages before returning. “However, given the limited resources, survival is not guaranteed,” said Kalonji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;In Bulape, people are concerned about the impact on their living conditions, said Ethienne Makashi, the local official in charge of water, hygiene and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we do have one case showing good progress, which gives a glimmer of hope for those receiving care,” said Makashi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adetayo reported from Lagos, Nigeria&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Travis Rose planned for more than a month to get her family vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu before their September trip to Disney World. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Less than 24 hours before their Aug. 28 appointment, it was canceled without an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“No notice, just canceled,” Rose told WRAL News. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rose said she wanted the vaccines specifically to protect her son, Aiden. The 17-year-old has autism, which the FDA considers a high-risk condition for COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; “He smells everything, and he’s constantly wanting to touch. He is very sensory-seeking, and he loves to touch his face,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “We are going to Disney World. We’re talking about the belly of the beast as far as germs are concerned. It’s this fine line between not wanting to hide but wanting to still have quality of life and live life. Vaccines have given us the ability to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections in the Orlando area went from 400 cases on July 4, to more than 1,000 cases reported every week for the last three weeks of August, according to the Florida Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Travis Rose said her husband, Joshua Rose, went to a military clinic in Fayetteville to ask how to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He was told that &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/video/coronavirus/video/doctor-s-prescription-required-for-covid-vaccine-at-pharmacies/22152769/"&gt;North Carolina law required a doctor’s note&lt;/a&gt; for the family to get their vaccines if they want them before before the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) releases updated guidance. That isn’t expected to happen until the committee’s upcoming meeting on Sept. 18.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is one of a handful of states with laws &lt;a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/vaccines"&gt;barring pharmacists from administering COVID-19 vaccines until the ACIP releases its recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, unless someone age 18 and up has a prescription written by their doctor&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rose told WRAL News that she and her husband were able to get their shots with their prescriptions. The parents were told that Aiden Rose could still be vaccinated by a private doctor, but the family then ran into another issue when no private practice near them had the doses in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In Fayetteville right now, Womack Army Medical Center did not have them, the hospitals and urgent cares did not have them, our clinic doesn’t have them. The only people that have them can’t give them, because it’s a pharmacy thing,” Travis Rose said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The family spoke to WRAL News on Thursday -- during their drive to Florida -- to express their frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I did everything I was supposed to do, and we still weren’t able to protect him,” Rose said. “I don’t want my child to die. I don’t want my child to be at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The mother said she had this message to those responsible for the red tape her family was caught in. “This isn’t about politics, this is about allowing parents to protect their children," she said. "Don’t take the tools away from us that allow us to protect our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip-recs/hcp/vaccine-specific/covid-19.html"&gt;ACIP releases its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC director still needs to sign off for final approval. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Typically, the ACIP meets soon after the FDA issues its vaccine approvals. The ACIP was dissolved this summer when it typically would provide fall immunization recommendations.  The panel was not reconstituted until August.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medications taken years ago can continue to shape the human gut microbiome, according to a large-scale study from the University of Tartu Institute of Genomics.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stool+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stool samples&lt;/a&gt; and prescription records from over 2,500 Estonian Biobank participants in the Estonian Microbiome cohort, researchers found that the majority of drugs studied were linked to microbiome changes, with a substantial number of them also showing long-term effects detectable years after patients stopped taking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact was not limited to antibiotics: antidepressants, beta-blockers, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/proton+pump+inhibitors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;proton pump inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, and benzodiazepines all left microbial "fingerprints."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important as it is a surprisingly strong factor in explaining individual microbiome differences," said Dr. Oliver Aasmets, lead author. This highlights that it is critical to account for drug usage history when studying links between the microbiome and disease. The research is &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00541-25" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;mSystems&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, benzodiazepines—commonly prescribed for anxiety—had microbiome effects comparable to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/broad-spectrum+antibiotics/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;broad-spectrum antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;. The results also show that drugs from the same class that might be used for the same condition, e.g. diazepam and alprazolam, may differ in how much they disrupt the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-up samples from a subset of participants confirmed that starting or stopping certain drugs caused predictable microbial shifts, suggesting causal effects. Despite the small sample size of the second time-point analysis, the authors were able to verify &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/long-term+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;long-term effects&lt;/a&gt; of proton pump inhibitors, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/selective+serotonin+reuptake+inhibitors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; and antibiotics, such as penicillins in combination and macrolides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a comprehensive systematic evaluation of long-term medication effects on the microbiome using real-world medical health records," said Professor Elin Org, corresponding author. "We hope this encourages researchers and clinicians to factor in medication history when interpreting microbiome data."&lt;/p&gt;

The research, which tracked participants from an earlier clinical trial, suggests that the combination of the psychedelic substance with psychotherapy can lead to lasting improvements in mental health and overall well-being. The findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1556/2054.2025.00461"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychedelic Studies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is the primary psychoactive compound found in certain species of mushrooms, often referred to as “magic mushrooms.” When ingested, it can produce profound alterations in perception, mood, and thought. In recent years, researchers have been investigating its potential as a therapeutic tool when administered in a controlled clinical setting alongside psychological support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale for this line of research stems from the limitations of existing treatments for major depressive disorder. While many people benefit from conventional antidepressants and psychotherapy, a substantial portion do not achieve lasting remission, and medications often come with undesirable side effects and require daily, long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychedelic-assisted therapy represents a different treatment model, one where a small number of high-intensity experiences might catalyze durable psychological changes. This new study was conducted to understand the longevity of the effects observed in an earlier, promising trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Alan Davis, an associate professor and director of the Center for Psychedelic Drug Research and Education at The Ohio State University, sought to determine if the initial antidepressant effects would hold up over a much longer period. Davis co-led the original 2021 trial at Johns Hopkins University, and this follow-up represents a collaborative effort between researchers at both institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was designed as a long-term extension of a clinical trial first published in 2021. That initial study involved 24 adults with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The participants were divided into two groups: one that received the treatment immediately and another that was placed on a wait-list before receiving the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic protocol was intensive, involving approximately 13 hours of psychotherapy in addition to two separate sessions where participants received a dose of psilocybin. The original findings were significant, showing a large and rapid reduction in depression symptoms for the participants, with about half reporting a complete remission from their depression that lasted for up to one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new follow-up, conducted an average of five years after the original treatment, the researchers contacted all 24 of the initial participants. Of those, 18 enrolled and completed the follow-up assessments. This process involved a series of online questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as any functional impairment in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also underwent a depression rating assessment administered by a clinician and took part in in-depth interviews. These interviews were intended to capture a more nuanced understanding of their experiences and life changes since the trial concluded, going beyond what numerical scores alone could convey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that 67% of the original participants were in remission from their depression. This percentage was slightly higher than the 58% who were in remission at the one-year follow-up point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure their analysis was robust, the scientists took a conservative approach when handling the data for the six individuals who did not participate in the long-term follow-up. They made the assumption that these participants had experienced a complete relapse and that their depression symptoms had returned to their pre-treatment levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even controlling for those baseline estimates from the people who didn’t participate in the long-term follow-up, we still see a very large and significant reduction in depression symptoms,” said Davis, who also holds faculty positions in internal medicine and psychology at Ohio State. “That was really exciting for us because this showed that the number of participants still in complete remission from their depression had gone up slightly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that these lasting improvements were not solely the product of the psilocybin therapy sessions from five years earlier. The reality of the participants’ lives was more complex. Through the interviews, the researchers learned that only three of the 18 follow-up participants had not received any other form of depression-related treatment in the intervening years. The others had engaged in various forms of support, including taking antidepressant medications, undergoing traditional psychotherapy, or trying other treatments like ketamine or psychedelics on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the qualitative data provided important context for these decisions. Many participants described a fundamental shift in their relationship with depression after the trial. Before undergoing psilocybin-assisted therapy, they often felt their depression was a debilitating and all-encompassing condition that prevented them from engaging with life. After the treatment, even if symptoms sometimes returned, they perceived their depression as more situational and manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported a greater capacity for positive emotions and enthusiasm. Davis explained that these shifts appeared to lead to important changes in how they related to their depressive experiences. This newfound perspective may have made other forms of therapy more effective or made navigating difficult periods less impairing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five years later, most people continued to view this treatment as safe, meaningful, important, and something that catalyzed an ongoing betterment of their life,” said Davis, who co-led the 2021 trial at Johns Hopkins University. “It’s important for us to understand the details of what comes after treatment. I think this is a sign that regardless of what the outcomes are, their lives were improved because they participated in something like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants who had tried using psychedelics on their own reported that the experiences were not as helpful without the supportive framework provided by the clinical trial, reinforcing the idea that the therapeutic context is a vital component of the treatment’s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding safety, 11 of the participants reported no negative effects since the trial. A few recalled feeling unprepared for the heightened emotional sensitivity they experienced after the treatment, while others noted that the process of weaning off their previous medications before the trial was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge several limitations of their work. The small sample size of the original trial means that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and require replication in larger studies. Because the study was a long-term follow-up without a continuing control group, it is not possible to definitively attribute all the observed benefits to the psilocybin-assisted therapy, especially since most participants sought other forms of treatment during the five-year period. It is also difficult to know how natural fluctuations in mood and life circumstances may have influenced the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should aim to include larger and more diverse groups of participants, including individuals with a high risk for suicide, who were excluded from this trial. Despite these limitations, this study provides a first look at the potential for psilocybin-assisted therapy to produce durable, long-term positive effects for people with major depressive disorder.

&lt;p&gt;Chicago health officials released a health alert about leptospirosis cases in the city after numerous infections were reported and at least one person died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contagious bacterial disease has been found in at least four recent cases, the Chicago Department of Public Health told NBC Chicago, with one of those cases resulting in a death. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"All four of the most recent cases, including the patient who died, had either direct contact with animal urine or droppings (primarily rats) or indirect contact through yard work or gardening," the department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH had recently issued a Health Alert Network alert about leptospirosis earlier this week alerting healthcare providers in the city of the recent cases to "let them know to test patients who may be displaying compatible symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;What is leptospirosis?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis is a disease that affects many &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/pets/index.html"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, including dogs, and people and can be found in contaminated water or soil, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html"&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The bacteria can survive in contaminated water or soil for weeks to months," the CDC reports.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated in humans, the disease can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, trouble breathing and even death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms in humans include: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Body or muscle aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vomiting or nausea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Yellowed skin and eyes (jaundice)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Red eyes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stomach pain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms in dogs and other animals: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lethargy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/vomiting/"&gt;Vomiting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/loss-of-appetite/"&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/does-my-pet-have-a-fever/"&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Discolored urine (dark yellow to orange)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Joint or muscle pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that many animals will show no signs of infection at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people, the disease can take anywhere from two to 30 days to start showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC warns it could occur in two phases: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first phase, people may have fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or diarrhea. The person may feel better for a while but become ill again.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some people may suffer a more severe second phase with kidney or liver failure, or inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illness can last from a few days to several weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;How can you prevent in?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH recommends you: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid contact with floodwater and do not eat food contaminated with floodwater&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reduce rodent populations:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report sightings or suspicions of rodents to 311&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use a secure lid for trash and compost bins.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where possible, seal entry points to prevent rats from entering your yard, and reduce standing debris, tall grass, and other items around your yard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean up animal urine or feces appropriately by wearing rubber or plastic gloves, cleaning thoroughly with disinfectant, and washing your hands afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If doing yardwork/gardening or standing in water:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover wounds/scratches/abrasions with waterproof bandages if doing yardwork/gardening or standing in water&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wear waterproof gloves and closed toe shoes or rubber boots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Talk to your veterinarian about leptospirosis vaccination if you have a pet dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The science behind Dr. Patrick’s claims&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patrick, who completed her postdoctoral fellowship at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute and currently serves as founder of FoundMyFitness, has &lt;a href="https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;built her reputation&lt;/a&gt; on translating complex scientific research into actionable health insights. Her academic credentials include published research in journals such as &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FASEB Journal&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4566436/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4566436/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;extensive work&lt;/a&gt; on aging, nutrition, and disease prevention.&lt;a href="https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Patrick described the routine as sustainable intensity exercise where “you’re not really having a conversation while you’re doing it,” but it’s “far from all-out” effort.&lt;a href="https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.myworkout.com/en/4x4intervals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.myworkout.com/en/4x4intervals" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;The exercise can be performed&lt;/a&gt; on various equipment including stationary bikes, rowing machines, or assault bikes, with participants maintaining approximately 75-80% of their maximum heart rate during the active intervals. The total workout, including warm-up and cool-down, takes roughly 30-40 minutes and needs to be performed only once or twice per week.&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1fcbykh/programs_to_work_up_to_doing_4x4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1fcbykh/programs_to_work_up_to_doing_4x4/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol’s effectiveness stems from landmark research &lt;a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world’s leading cardiovascular journals. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Dr. Benjamin Levine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, followed 61 healthy but sedentary middle-aged adults (average age 53) for two years.&lt;a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;structured exercise program&lt;/a&gt; that included the Norwegian 4×4 protocol once weekly showed remarkable improvements: an 18% increase in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and a more than 25% improvement in left ventricular compliance, effectively reversing structural heart changes by approximately 20 years.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, our hearts get smaller and stiffer,” Patrick said during her Diary of a CEO interview. “After those two years of 5 to 6 hours of physical exercise every single week, their hearts looked 20 years younger in terms of structure.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to the protocol’s anti-aging effects is its impact on &lt;a href="https://www.icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during exercise. &lt;a href="https://quatuormd.ca/en/vo2-max-not-just-for-athletes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://quatuormd.ca/en/vo2-max-not-just-for-athletes/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;Research consistently shows&lt;/a&gt; VO2 max as one of the strongest predictors of longevity and cardiovascular health.&lt;a href="https://icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2707428" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2707428" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;A major study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involving over 122,000 participants found individuals with the lowest VO2 max values had a fourfold increased risk of mortality compared to those with the highest values. Simply moving from the bottom 25th percentile to the 25th-50th percentile was associated with a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality.&lt;a href="https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Performing the exercise safely&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patrick emphasized the Norweigan 4×4 protocol requires progressive implementation. “It’s not easy, you can’t just start doing it right out the gate,” she said. “You want to kind of work your way up to that… work your way up as you do it one week, two weeks, you know, a month later, two months later.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For business professionals seeking efficient health optimization, the Norwegian 4×4 protocol offers significant advantages. Its time-efficient nature, requiring less than an hour total including warm-up and cool-down, makes it practical for busy schedules while delivering outsized returns on investment in terms of cardiovascular health and longevity. And the research suggests this minimal time commitment could provide protection against heart failure, particularly the type known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which becomes increasingly common with age and sedentary lifestyle.&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There have been suggestions, not well-supported by evidence, that mosquitoes may prefer certain blood types or particularly "sweet blood". Overall, it appears that mosquitoes are indeed attracted to certain individuals over others, sometimes choosing the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/always-getting-bitten-by-mosquitos-this-contributor-to-your-skin-s-odor-could-be-why-65805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;same target night after night&lt;/a&gt; despite plenty of available meals, and part of the answer is to do with odor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, researchers recruited 465 participants to study the phenomenon in a more natural setting than a lab: a music festival in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the festival, the team asked volunteers to fill in questionnaires about their hygiene, diet, and activity at the festival. This included how much alcohol they had consumed, and their sleeping arrangements for their stay (including whether they were alone), as well as the usual demographic questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, it was time to set some mosquitoes loose and see which of the participants the insects were most attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mosquito attraction was measured using a custom designed setup: a transparent cage with perforations where female &lt;em&gt;Anopheles &lt;/em&gt;mosquitoes were offered a choice between a sugar-feeder and the participants arm," the team explains in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mosquitoes could only smell, not bite, the participant’s arm. Attraction was quantified through video imaging, measuring arm landings relative to total landings. Mosquito attraction was correlated with questionnaire responses and skin microbiota profiles collected from forearm skin swabs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvrvJAd-20Y?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that mosquitoes were less attracted to festival-goers who wore sunscreen, and who had skipped their usual shower routine. As well as this, they found that individuals with more &lt;em&gt;Streptococci &lt;/em&gt;on their skin were more attractive to the insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more important was whether the participants had drunk beer, and whether they had slept alone. Those that had drunk beer specifically – blood alcohol levels did not have a noticeable effect – were significantly more attractive to mosquitoes, as well as those who had not slept alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The general picture that emerges from our study suggests that a sober life-style – abstaining from drugs and alcohol, sleeping alone, and applying sunscreen regularly – lowers one’s chances of getting bitten by mosquitoes," the team explains. "While we found no evidence supporting popular myths such as blood type influencing bite frequency, we were unable to assess the existence of so-called ‘sweet blood.’ Ultimately, enjoy the next festival or camping trip as you like – but it seems mosquitoes may have a soft spot for those making less responsible choices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though an interesting study, looking at a fairly natural environment, the team notes a few caveats, including that the participants were a self-selecting group of music-loving science enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While our findings are intriguing, there may be other contributing factors yet to be identified," the team adds. "Further research is certainly needed before we suggest rejecting a beer solely to avoid mosquito bites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do enjoy a beer, consider slathering yourself up in sunscreen first, or maybe forgoing your wash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is posted to pre-print server &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.21.671470v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxNNFpOQ3F6N1UwaXM1R2JZVkpLLUEzX0NJejdDWm00ZlNrMzhNeHJkcU1zRk9ha2dqQzBCWnE4UmQweVh6WWN4RU5ORXk3VXM2Y3FEZW9PWTUxNEJ1YlV0N0RLS0FlQk45VTV1b0FrZENoRDlIMTJIaW5wMW1ndG9WcWcwU29oRXZlOHM1c1ljYVozOFktUmRXUDdUejJETnhwdGYtTFdpUURlSzBWWlAyQWNVRFlQM09vVFN3U2xUUUJnU1dQ</guid></item><item><title>彻底改变囊性纤维化治疗的科学家赢得了着名的拉斯克奖- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/lasker-award-cycstic-fibrosis-treatments/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three scientists who revolutionized the treatment of cystic fibrosis and prolonged the lifespan of patients with the deadly disease have won the Lasker Award, one of the most prestigious awards in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vertex Pharmaceuticals researcher Paul Negulescu, former Vertex researcher Jesús (Tito) González, and University of Iowa professor Michael Welsh, will share the $250,000 prize. The Lasker DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, as it’s formally known, is given for a “major advance that improves the lives of thousands of people,” according to the Lasker Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not only gratifying and rewarding,” said Negulescu, a senior vice president at Vertex. “Our hope is that our work can serve as lessons for other research.”&lt;/p&gt;

It's one of this year's Lasker Awards — biomedical-research prizes established in 1945 that are often called the "American Nobels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="e6c52c7c-7a5a-43ec-81b5-f9a5e5d75c83-2"&gt;"It's super gratifying," said González, who was formerly the senior director of biology at Vertex Therapeutics. "It's very rare to actually have something [in medical research] that goes all the way to patients and is made widely available, and to have such a dramatic effect," he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="65fcd175-3452-4688-b236-43a13312199f"&gt;The treatment, called Trikafta, extends the lifespans of people with CF by decades — and patients who start treatment in childhood or adolescence are expected to live near-average lifespans. By comparison, when the disease was first discovered in the 1930s, most patients died in early childhood. And even in the 2010s, before Trikafta's approval in 2019, about half of CF patients died before age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, the estimated median age of survival for persons with cystic fibrosis who were born between 2020 and 2024 and have access to treatment is 65 years," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/sorscher-eric.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/sorscher-eric.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Eric Sorscher&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Emory University wrote in an essay about the award, published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcibr2510197?query=RP" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcibr2510197?query=RP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Available projections suggest that health and longevity may increase further as modulators begin to be administered at younger ages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lasker Award "also brings back a lot of great memories and it really warms your heart when you think of all the people you've worked with, and all the time and effort," González added. "I just hope people understand how difficult it is to go this far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system/scientist-who-discovered-body-s-fire-alarm-against-invading-bacteria-wins-250-000-lasker-prize" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system/scientist-who-discovered-body-s-fire-alarm-against-invading-bacteria-wins-250-000-lasker-prize"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientist who discovered body's 'fire alarm' against invading bacteria wins $250,000 Lasker prize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qLYpJMg7BZ5sqgRmxUGse" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qLYpJMg7BZ5sqgRmxUGse slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/cystic-fibrosis/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/cystic-fibrosis/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in a gene called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/cftr/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/cftr/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CFTR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When functional, the gene enables cells to make tubes inside their membranes that charged particles called ions can flow through. That, in turn, lets water flow as it should through tissues and helps organs, like the lungs, intestines and pancreas, do their jobs properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in CF, the CFTR gene malfunctions, causing thick, sticky mucus to clog the linings of these organs. The mucus gums up airways, raising the risk of dangerous infections and scarring in the lungs, and it can cause issues with digestion, the absorption of nutrients and insulin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab research conducted by Welsh in the 1980s and 1990s helped lay the groundwork for Trikafta, a drug that addresses the molecular cause of most types of CF. Working with cells from the airways of people with the disease, Welsh and colleagues unraveled the "physiological consequences" of the most common genetic error seen in people with CF, González explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work demonstrated that this defect in the CFTR gene — known as delta-f508 — makes it so that charged particles can't pass through the tubes in the cell membrane as easily. The mutation means that the tubes never actually reach the surface of the cell, so the ions get stuck. In various experiments that involved cooling down the cells as they grew in lab dishes, Welsh showed that the tube could be made to reach the cell surface and thus better transport ions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/16384-nobel-prize-chemistry-list.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/16384-nobel-prize-chemistry-list.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nobel-winner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Roger Tsien, González co-invented a system that could accurately track the flow of ions across cell membranes in real time. The initial inspiration behind the system was to study how the brain worked, as ions moving across membranes enable brain cells to fire, he said. But the system was also perfect for testing potential new CF drugs designed to fix the ion-transport issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This allowed us to screen tens of thousands of compounds a day," González said. "While electrophysiology, the standard method at the time for studying ion channels in depth, was very slow, just a handful a day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers refined the process to hunt for CF drugs at biotech company Aurora Biosciences, which was later acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negulescu, also at Aurora and later Vertex, led the project of screening molecules to see how they affected ion transport. His team looked for "potentiators," which boost the flow of ions, and "correctors," which help move the tubes into the right position in the cell membrane. This effort led to the approval of several iterations of CF drugs — in 2012, 2015 and 2018 — before finally leading to Trikafta's approval in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they started getting data back from the earliest human trials of their first-generation drug, González recalled "that was super exciting because that it became very real. It's like, 'Oh wow, this is not just theory; this is actually working in patients.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trikafta combines three drugs to effectively treat most people with CF. Its use has reduced the number of lung transplants and hospitalizations for infection among people with the disease, and improved patients' quality of life, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/combined-triple-drug-therapy-for-cystic-fibrosis/" target="_blank" data-url="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/combined-triple-drug-therapy-for-cystic-fibrosis/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement from the Lasker Awards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Welsh, González, and Negulescu’s achievements are affording people with CF the chance to thrive now and to plan vibrant futures," the statement says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a3b3c0ad-c394-48a7-be3f-fe6d606d7e84"&gt;Two additional Lasker Awards were awarded this year, including one for basic research and another for special achievements in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former prize went to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/goerlich" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/goerlich" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dirk Görlich&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Germany and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/14812/steven-mcknight.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/14812/steven-mcknight.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Steven McKnight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the lab study, THC exposure led to a nine percent increase in rates of embryos containing an improper number of chromosomes, and more than doubled the rate of abnormalities in spindles, structures that assist in chromosomal development. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers caveated their results, noting that people undergoing IVF are taking large amounts of hormones, so their findings may not be generalizable to the larger public.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Samples used in the study came from females under the age of 40 and it is unclear as to when they consumed THC products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most chromosomally abnormal embryos will either fail to implant in the uterus or will result in miscarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more rare instances, the abnormal embryos may result in chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, exposing immature egg cells to THC disrupted their ability to sort chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An abnormality in the way an egg cell's chromosomes line up during cell division is linked with miscarriage and birth defects such as Edwards syndrome, which causes deadly growth delays, and Patau syndrome, which causes physical and developmental abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Autism Research Institute notes that previous research has also found that prenatal exposure to cannabis may increase likelihood of autism, with animal studies suggesting THC can lead to genetic mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, chromosomal abnormalities and defects are tied to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These effects were seen in the recent study with people who had THC in their systems from marijuana products while they were pregnant or undergoing IVF.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of their investigation, the authors of the recent study conclude: 'These findings underscore the need for increased awareness and caution among people with ovaries, particularly those undergoing fertility treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study highlights the importance of informing patients about the potential risks associated with cannabis consumption and provides a basis for regulatory bodies, medical professional societies, and public health organizations to establish recommendations and guidelines regarding cannabis consumption during fertility treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63011-2#Sec2"&gt;were published&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal, Nature Communications.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the analysis of IVF patients, just 60 percent of embryos in the THC-positive group had the proper number of chromosomes, compared to 67 percent in the THC-negative group. These 'abnormal' results are pictured above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also looked at how marijuana can harm fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study led by the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-2bdd3930-8e58-11f0-ac7c-e970e0b4e8cc"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Irvine (UCI), found adolescent female mice exposed to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive chemical in the drug, had 50 percent fewer healthy ovarian follicles than the control group by the time they were adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the body's endocannabinoid system - which is stimulated when marijuana is used - damages follicles or causes them to activate too quickly, depleting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With marijuana use now commonplace among teens across America, researchers fear many young women are unknowingly damaging their likelihood of having a child in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study was on mice, separate research has shown that pregnant women who use cannabis are at a greater risk of birth defects, miscarriages and stillbirths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has found that marijuana may damage semen quality and affect male fertility too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2018 study out of Tulane and the University of Washington, researchers looked at samples from men in Washington, where the drug has been legal for recreational use since 2012, and compared it with their cannabis consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that men who had consumed cannabis in their lifetime were more likely to have abnormally-shaped sperm and lower concentrations of sperm compared to men who had never used the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:01:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNb0hRYy1uNTNRVHVSMnBVX3pMY3ZMWHFiYmNTT2VyVGVFY3hJSGZUZ3RrTU5sRG5venF6aFlhNlRaZzFUYTZYSm5ObXhuZm9ZTnVFQnA4bWhRMkI2czdVR1BlR2psOURjZXBHaVFSSTlJVkRUQVV2THM3aDFBZHJnc000MktETkI2YnVYVDRvNmZuTE5YUGhMRzNONHhjX3ZtV3fSAacBQVVfeXFMTzI1QU9CZ01tR3d2OTQyeThKdTAzX2NlQi01QTJCUFNZcHdLV3E4MjdleWVWOVk2cnlvUEo3dEUwamNkWVRUbTk3V2dvQzFmNWZOc0JSVXhfOXVGb3F4RkNGZEV4S0NvTlZoMXduZGtqM2FPQmRXcVYxc0hYTDA5dnZpTlJqWDRrUDZJQWZST3A1SDVTQ3JvNXBEQWp0Wk8xdUM5MUZqZ2M</guid></item><item><title>杀死查理的天使明星Farrah Fawcett的“禁忌”癌症的新警报飙升-医生发现谁有风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15088799/women-cervical-anal-cancer-farrah-fawcett.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of women could be offered screening for a little-discussed &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-9616f680-8f23-11f0-b861-4f2c49e4320e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, after a major study revealed survivors of another cancer face elevated risks years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research focused on anal cancer, which remains rare but is rising fastest in older women – and found that those who have previously had cervical cancer are at significantly higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current guidelines recommend screening for certain high-risk groups, including people with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-96191960-8f23-11f0-b861-4f2c49e4320e"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and women with a history of vulvar cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors say a crucial group is being overlooked, as cases of the disease continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates are rising most sharply among women over 65, with cases in this age group increasing by around 4 per cent a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most famous cases was American actress Farrah Fawcett – a 1970s TV icon best known for Charlie's Angels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She revealed her anal cancer diagnosis in 2006, which at the time sparked tabloid speculation about her sex life because of the stigma surrounding the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fawcett died in 2009, aged 62, after the cancer spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of the most famous cases was American actress Farrah Fawcett – a 1970s TV icon best known for Charlie’s Angels (pictured with her long-term partner, actor Ryan O’Neal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fawcett revealed her cancer diagnosis in 2006, which at the time sparked tabloid speculation about her sex life. Fawcett died in 2009, aged 62, after the cancer spread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the trend continues, oncologists at the US National Cancer Institute warn numbers could double in less than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now researchers led by Dr Haluk Damgacioglu, an expert in disease modelling at the Medical University of South Carolina, say women who have survived cervical cancer should also be considered high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their study, more than 85,500 women diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1975 and 2021 were tracked for an average of nine years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those already diagnosed with anal cancer, or who developed it within two months of their cervical cancer diagnosis, were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the remaining women, 64 went on to develop anal cancer – with risk climbing sharply 10 to 15 years after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 60 per cent of cases in women aged 65 to 74 occurred more than 15 years after their cervical cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The threshold currently used to justify screening programmes is 17 cases per 100,000 people. In this age group, the study found rates of 17.6 per 100,000 – high enough to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal JAMA Network Open, Dr Damgacioglu said: 'These findings support the need for age-based and duration-based anal cancer screening recommendations for women with a cervical cancer history.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;HPV is thought to be behind at least 90 per cent of anal cancers and 99 per cent of cervical cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'In summary, this study provides critical data to inform anal cancer screening recommendations among a high-risk population of women with a history of cervical cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is now calling for further research to weigh up the risks and benefits of screening, and to determine the best age to introduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cervical cancer itself remains a major killer, with around two women dying from it every day in the UK. It is often dubbed a 'silent killer' because symptoms can be mistaken for less serious problems such as period pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, the chance of surviving at least five years after an anal cancer diagnosis is around 95 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this plummets to just 15 per cent if the disease is detected late, once it has spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, women aged 25 to 49 are invited for cervical screening – more commonly known as a smear test – at their GP surgery every three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet uptake remains low, with only about 70 per cent of eligible women, or 4.6million, attending their scheduled test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 1,600 people are diagnosed with anal cancer in the UK every year, the majority of them women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross was famously diagnosed with anal cancer in 2017, which she attributes to a strain of HPV that may have also caused her husband's throat cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most high-profile cases in the US was Desperate Housewives actress Marcia Cross, who revealed her diagnosis in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include bleeding from the anus, pain in or around the area, small lumps felt around the anus, changes in bowel habits, and passing mucus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These issues can also be caused by more common conditions such as haemorrhoids or anal fissures – but persistent or unusual symptoms should always be checked by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both cervical and anal cancers are linked to infection with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is transmitted through sexual contact. More than 90 per cent of cases are thought to be caused by HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are more than 100 types of HPV, and only around 30 can affect the genital area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people never show symptoms, and the majority of cases go away without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in some cases it can cause tissue to grow abnormally, resulting over many years in cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning comes as health chiefs are urging under-25s who left school without receiving a life-saving cancer vaccine to come forward for the jab.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HARRISBURG, Pa. (WKBN) — The Pennsylvania Gaming Commission announced that a viral disease has infected deer in both Mercer and Lawrence counties.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;According to a press release, epizootic hemorrhagic disease or EHD has been investigated as the cause of death for some deer in southwestern and southeastern Pennsylvania, where test results are pending.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency said that the disease is spread to deer when they are bitten by infected midges, small insects often called “no-see-ums.” The disease surfaces in late summer and remains a threat to deer until temperatures drop and the midges die off, usually at the first hard frost. EHD can leave an impact on the infected deer population, according to the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;EHD has also been detected in Muddy Creek Township in Butler County and Mill Creek Township in Erie County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The bluetongue virus (BT) is another disease that causes similar problems. Deer that contract this contract clinical issues seven days after infection and die soon after. Symptoms of BT include swelling of the face or neck, loss of appetite, lethargy, weakness, lameness, respiratory distress, fever, and excessive salivation. The agency said that some deer survive the initial infection and can develop chronic signs like hoof cracks or overgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Game Commission said that there are currently no treatments for EHD or BT infections in wild deer, and for diseases spread by insects, wildlife management options are limited. The agency said that local deer populations often rebound within two to three years following an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;No Pennsylvania elk have contracted EHD or BT, and they are less susceptible to infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both diseases can affect domestic livestock. To report sick livestock, call the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture at 717-772-2852.&lt;/p&gt;

But when he began to experience urinary symptoms, he went to see his doctor in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that appointment, his doctor noticed that Riddleston, who hails from the English city of Chelmsford, had a “hard, irregular prostate,” according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15068947/Father-three-59-dismissed-backache-unaware-sign-stage-four-prostate-cancer.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daily Mail.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“Nurses, healthcare professionals, we think we're immune to everything that we treat our patients for, so I didn't even think of cancer at first,” Riddleston said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He underwent a PSA test; Short for Prostate-Specific Antigen, it’s a protein made by the prostate, and high levels could indicate cancer, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24615-psa-test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic &lt;/a&gt;explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of cyclists.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he received the news that he had high PSA levels, “I knew things weren't going to be very good,” he said. “I just felt like vomiting all over my computer, it was a really visceral, violent reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futher tests confirmed that Riddleston had &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-like-us-prostate-cancer-caregiving-spotlight-11760337" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prostate cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; — and after he was referred to London’s The Royal Marsden Hospital, he was given the devastating news that his cancer was stage four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riddleston said that, due to his healthcare background, he “knows too much” — which he admits is “not helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healthcare professionals that look after me are amazing, and I don't need to, but I sit there and make suggestions,” he said. “It gives me an element of control and they humor me along the way, which I'm very grateful for. The thing is, you never are in control with cancer and that's one of the most frightening aspects for me – it's panic stations really. You're just waiting for it to become more active and rear its ugly head.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s had &lt;a href="https://people.com/colon-cancer-180-chemo-treatments-mom-facing-her-end-11703601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemotherapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/danielle-fishel-breast-cancer-radiation-painful-burn-pod-meets-world-8773527" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:radiation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt;, and now Riddleston is on hormone treatment to limit the growth of prostate cancer cells.

This molecule, a derivative of vitamin A, is essential for the normal development of sperm cells. It controls the development of immature germ cells into mature sperm cells and facilitates the release of mature sperm into the seminiferous tubules within the testes. This link led scientists to test isotretinoin — a compound that mimics natural retinoic acid — as a potential way to jump-start sperm production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers enrolled 26 men with nonobstructive azoospermia — a condition in which there is no sperm in the ejaculate due to a problem with sperm production — and four men with cryptozoospermia, in which extremely low numbers of sperm are present in the ejaculate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the participants took 20 milligrams of isotretinoin twice daily for at least six months. Their blood values, hormone levels and semen were closely monitored at several time points during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 30 men in the study, 11 began producing motile sperm — sperm that swim efficiently — in their ejaculate. This enabled these men and their partners to start IVF without the need for surgical sperm collection. This treatment-responsive group included all four men with cryptozoospermia and seven men who had previously shown no sperm at all in their ejaculate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the remaining men who still lacked sperm in their ejaculate after treatment, doctors had to use surgery to collect sperm for IVF. But after isotretinoin, the procedure took far less time — 63 minutes, on average, compared with 105 minutes before treatment. (The report didn't note exactly why the surgery was more efficient after Accutane.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time the study was published, nine IVF cycles had been carried out with sperm collected after isotretinoin treatment, leading to multiple healthy embryos, some ongoing pregnancies and one live birth so far, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment wasn't free of side effects, however. All 30 men developed dry skin and chapped lips, and about half reported feeling irritable after the treatment. Some also had rashes and elevations in their cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Because isotretinoin can these levels and liver function, patients would need regular blood tests during treatment, Houman said. When people take Accutane for acne, doctors recommend periodic blood tests, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(13)03489-4/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(13)03489-4/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;although they don't agree on how frequently&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; these tests should be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, we do not yet know the optimal dose, duration, or long-term safety of isotretinoin in men seeking fertility," he said. "Another drawback is that response rates are unknown, and many men may not benefit at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until data from larger studies is available, isotretinoin shouldn't be used to treat male infertility outside of clinical trials, Houman cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, isotretinoin can be taken safely outside of pregnancy, but during pregnancy, it's considered highly dangerous because it &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a681043.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a681043.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can cause severe birth defects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This risk is so significant that the drug carries a black box warning and strict contraception requirements to adhere to when taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="066a4c59-8ca7-4c15-b885-e2722d2109ca"&gt;"In men, the situation is different," Houman said. The drug doesn't appear to damage sperm DNA or pose risks to reproductive partners or the resulting children. "In fact, this new research suggests it may have a paradoxical benefit by enhancing sperm production in certain men." This highlights "the very different biological contexts" between the male and female reproductive systems, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers hope to figure out which male infertility patients are most likely to benefit from isotretinoin; how to fine-tune the timing and dosage of the treatment; and whether the drug can improve sperm quality and fertility outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility that a simple course of oral medication could restore sperm production for some men "would represent a monumental shift in how we approach male infertility", Levine said. "It offers a new layer of hope — not just the hope of finding sperm, but the hope of restoring a natural biological function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-3NzeXPy96M9afiLovbDe7F-U2yd4jYFKJueHu6fEPZpq4DWwW0KRu6h" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-3NzeXPy96M9afiLovbDe7F-U2yd4jYFKJueHu6fEPZpq4DWwW0KRu6h slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In peat, most of that carbon sits below the surface in thick, oxygen poor layers that decompose very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These peat swamps also support biodiversity, the variety of living species in an ecosystem. When mining drains or digs up peat, both the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/carbon-storage-mystery-emerges-in-the-southern-ocean/"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; bank and the living communities take a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-satellites-saw"&gt;What the satellites saw&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed more than three decades of images from &lt;a href="https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Landsat&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. satellite program that produces consistent pictures of Earth’s surface each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That time series lets researchers pinpoint when forests were cleared and when bare mine pits appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They mapped mining scars along rivers in &lt;a href="https://7wonders.org/south-america/peru/madre-de-dios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Madre de Dios&lt;/a&gt;, a region in Peru that has seen a rapid spread of small operations. The scars are easy to spot because forest gives way to sand and water filled pits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-massive-carbon-release-from-mining"&gt;Massive carbon release from mining&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new paper, the team reports that mining has removed more than 550 hectares of peatland, with over half of that loss happening in just the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They estimate that 0.2 to 0.7 million tons of carbon have already been released, and they identify 63 of 219 peatlands showing evidence of mining at their edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also find that mining inside peat now accounts for 9 percent of all mining in the area and could reach 25 percent by 2027 if current trends hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis flags more than 10,000 hectares of peat at immediate risk, with a potential release of 3.5 to 14.5 million tons of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-the-ocean-holds-carbon-hidden-mechanisms-revealed/"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; if those areas are disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rapid proliferation of gold mining inside peatlands appears to be of such scope as to be an existential threat to the entire peatland complex,” wrote Householder. The numbers and the geographic pattern point in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tracked where mining is advancing. An outward front has been pushing into the alluvial plain at about 330 feet per year, and that front is reaching the peat rich margins where swamps are most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-mining-is-pushing-into-peatlands"&gt;Why mining is pushing into peatlands&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivers are the main highways in this part of the Amazon, so early mines hugged the banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As miners followed gold bearing sediments inland, access paths, machinery, and makeshift camps increased, lowering the barrier to work in wetter ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peatlands sit on the outer edges of the river plain where water pools for most of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once miners arrive with pumps and hoses, it gets easier for others to follow, especially where law enforcement relies on boats and cannot easily reach new clearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-driven-destruction"&gt;Human-driven destruction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long term remote sensing &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/12/1903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; record shows that mining has been a major driver of deforestation in southeastern Peru. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many operations are small and informal, and the work is a source of income for thousands of families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing often uses mercury, a toxic metal that binds to fine gold particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One river focused &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/em/c4em00567h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; documented elevated mercury in sediments and fish downstream of mining hubs and found that a large share of carnivorous fish exceeded health guidelines for mercury in tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities that rely on river fish face real exposure risks. This adds a public health layer to the climate and ecosystem costs of tearing up peat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-mining-made-this-carbon-bomb"&gt;How mining made this carbon bomb&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers combined annual vegetation change with a classifier that separates mining from other forest losses. That approach reduced false alarms from seasonal flooding or quick regrowth after storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then overlaid those mine maps with peat maps to see where pits and ponds overlap organic soils. That allowed them to calculate both the area lost and the likely carbon released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peat stores carbon more densely than nearby upland forests. When miners dig pits, drain water, or burn cleared vegetation, oxygen speeds up decay and carbon escapes into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small patches can have outsized impacts because a few feet of peat can hold as much &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/carbon-atoms-in-your-body-took-a-400000-light-year-journey-through-space/"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; as a much larger area of non peat forest. That is why a few hundred hectares of loss matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results point to three priorities that do not require new technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Map the edges of active peatlands at high resolution, monitor hot spots in near real time, and keep heavy equipment out of places where peat depth is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local voices and science can work together to steer enforcement and restoration budgets to the areas of highest risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peat that stays wet and shaded keeps its carbon, and that is the simplest way to avoid adding more heat trapping gases to the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 14:27:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZXVYWTJpbXhCdE5RTmNYeGxBYnZVUG5zSGZrbzd2Ujg2N3VMYk1feVFDeU1FdHlPUmhDVmNmS2s0RS1CdnRSTEhtcjNFU3FvTlFIcGYtdEVwbURIbXZiY24zRlRra1BJNDBDWEdyWF9hd2FGWURSb0pPYnJwZUl4Q0hDbHhtODJyMGp3LUxrcHdIalE2YUZrZVBLOFY4M1FQV0xiNUF3</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心警告说： “接吻虫”疾病在美国蔓延：我们所知道的- AL.com</title><link>https://www.al.com/news/2025/09/kissing-bug-disease-spreading-across-us-cdc-warns-what-we-know.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ABFPEQ5WY5AMDHJT6IWEEUDN5A"&gt;An emerging, potentially deadly disease is spreading through the United States, particularly in the South. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TNVQ3V74XRBJRDRHGFV44WHTCI"&gt;Chagas disease is caused by parasites in triatomine insects, also known as “kissing bugs” because they &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/chagas-disease-which-can-be-deadly-now-considered-endemic-us" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;tend to bite people in the face&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6HOJLLA7PRBWXNVO2LBZOJ36MY"&gt;When kissing bugs bite, they pass the parasite in its feces.

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating less than 130 grams of carbohydrates daily can make you tired and irritable.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cutting carbs completely can lead to nutrient deficiencies because you miss out on fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy and one of three macronutrients. Cutting them out can lead to big changes in how the body runs and possibly do more harm than good. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-your-body-will-go-into-ketosis"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Your Body Will Go Into Ketosis &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you stop eating carbs, your body goes through two main changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First, it starts gluconeogenesis, which creates glucose from alternative sources like amino acids from muscle and glycerol from fats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“While it can be useful for short-term survival, the body shouldn’t stay in that state for a prolonged time, as it could lead to hormone imbalances, hyperglycemia, liver and thyroid processes,” said &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/expert/samantha-coogan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Coogan, MS, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Didactic Program in Nutrition and Dietetics at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Within 24 to 48 hours of quitting carbs, your glycogen stores—the body's backup energy supply—start to run out. &lt;strong&gt;To keep the brain and muscles running, the body is forced to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-ketosis-8663885" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;burn fat for fuel&lt;/a&gt;, known as ketosis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-ketosis"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Are the Side Effects of Ketosis? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We cannot survive without carbs," Coogan said. &lt;strong&gt;The human body needs at least 130 g of carbs daily just for basic function, and more if you're physically active. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some common short-term effects of ketosis include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Irritability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Keto flu”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long-term ketosis can also lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially fatal condition in which ketones build up in the blood in people with diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-do-low-carb-diets-help-you-lose-weight"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Do Low-Carb Diets Help You Lose Weight? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Low-carb diets have been a popular strategy for weight loss for decades, but there’s no clear consensus on what defines a “low-carb.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most studies consider carbohydrate intake under 26% of daily calories as low-carb, while nutrition guidelines tend to recommend anywhere between 45 to 65% as normal calorie intake for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One theory supporting low-carb diets, especially for people with diabetes, maintains that increasing protein and fat leads to greater satiety and fewer blood sugar dips, naturally reducing calorie intake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some clinical trials show &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-lose-weight-11704272" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;short-term weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and better blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but these benefits often plateau within the year. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “In the long term, the results of people doing low-carb versus other types of plants net out,” &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/julie-stefanski" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julie Stefanski, MEd, RDN, LDN, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She added that&lt;strong&gt; low-carb diets are so restrictive and hard to stick with that the results are similar to other diets after a year. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-keto-diets-good-for-you"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Are Keto Diets Good for You?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A well-known low-carb diet is Keto, limiting carbs to just 50 grams daily to keep the body in ketosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though Ketogenic diets can be helpful for people with diabetes or epilepsy in the short-term, their safety remains a bit unclear since there’s no universally accepted definition, and evidence remains conflicted on their long-term efficacy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More research is needed before it can be confidently recommended for routine diabetic care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The danger doesn’t really come from being in that state for a short-term period. It really comes from avoiding the foods that are nourishing that do have carbohydrates,” said Stefanski. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You can risk access to nutrients found in carbs like:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-carbohydrates-are-necessary-for-your-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Carbohydrates Are Necessary for Your Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are essential to your body’s processes, especially with energy use and recovery. For example, one study found athletes recovered better with carbs than with protein alone, showing carbs are just as crucial for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/nutrition-mistakes-that-hinder-muscle-growth-11736430" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle repair and growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond supplying energy, carbs are also how the body gets fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. When you stop eating natural carbohydrates, you inadvertently deprive the body of the nutrients it needs to be healthy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cutting carbs entirely can raise the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/keto-diet-long-term-risks-5197991" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of cholesterol, kidney stones, poor bone health&lt;/a&gt;, gut problems, and even cancer, added Stefanki. &lt;br&gt;

Local officials have erected multiple checkpoints along the border to prevent people from traveling in or out of the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Francois Mingambengele, administrator of the Mweka territory which includes Bulape, said: 'The problem is that we're afraid that the movement of people from Bulape could lead to contamination in other communities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Healthcare workers carry a coffin with a baby, suspected of dying from Ebola, in the Democratic Republic of Congo during an outbreak in 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thermometers are pictured at the entrance of an Ebola treatment center checkpoint during a 2019 outbreak in the DRC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Reuters: 'Some are going into the bush to hide. It's a crisis, and cases are multiplying.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ebola is spread by contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person, as well as contact with contaminated objects or infected animals such as bats or primates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain and weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and unexplained bleeding or bruising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ebola can cause serious disease and has a mortality rate as high as 90 percent without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are currently two FDA-approved treatments for Ebola: Inmazeb and Ebanga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also an FDA-approved vaccine for the disease but it is not available to the public and only given to people responding to outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first confirmed case in the DRC, according to the WHO, was a pregnant woman who went to Bulape General Reference Hospital on August 20 with a high fever, bloody stool, excessive bleeding and weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She died five days later from organ failure and testing on September 4 confirmed Ebola.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, another outbreak was declared in Uganda, with 12 confirmed cases and two probable, as well as four deaths. The outbreak was declared over in April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak was declared over the Sudan Virus, a rare virus that causes a severe form of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the typical Ebola symptoms, it also causes bleeding from the eyes, nose, gums and other body parts, organ failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New York officials suspected two patients at a Manhattan urgent care may have had Ebola earlier this year because the patients had recently traveled from Uganda where there was an outbreak of the disease at the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Images showed first responders wore face coverings and gloves as they moved the patients into ambulances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no specific cure or treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest Ebola outbreak occurred in 2014 to 2016 in West Africa when more than 28,600 cases were reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In February of this year, two suspected Ebola cases were detected in the US. Patients were transported from a New York City urgent care to a hospital after they exhibited symptoms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials suspected they could have had Ebola infections because the patients had recently traveled from Uganda where an outbreak was ongoing at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was later confirmed that they did not have Ebola, but it was not revealed what illness they were suffering from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first person to have a confirmed Ebola infection in the US was a man from Liberia in 2014. He had traveled to the US where he began experiencing Ebola-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After tests confirmed the illness on September 30, 2014, he became the first US patient to have the disease.

It’s entirely possible that the increased mortality rate in late eaters is connected to the underlying health or genetic issues they faced, and which also caused them to delay their meals.

Shifts in meal time might not only reflect underlying health problems but could also influence circadian rhythms, which help regulate things like sleep and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though more research is needed, keeping a consistent breakfast routine could be one simple step toward supporting healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 12:45:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQVDNKRzlucnVmNjBva19pR1BjS3ExRTB6dmotM3BqNVNyMWg0YzI5N3JtdG5qQzRVemxwOUw4Z0gzX01aeHRNT0lNMzc3b1ljaXRxWlJMRDRfdkE5MHhyaGdGeDcya1VuQzZGS0haV3MwendoUllQRXpLcEk3aF8tcTU1OEM</guid></item><item><title>一项新的研究显示，单次运动可能会减缓癌细胞的生长-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/11/exercise-cancer-benefits-prevention-recurrence/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QYKJEJKTLNBRTEPDKY2CIZKWSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Exercising muscles pumps out substances that can suppress&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the growth of breast cancer cells, according to an important new study of exercise and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJRARYDOWVETDGV4IB7IIXU2KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40608178/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published last month, involved 32 women who’d survived breast cancer.

Discover why they should be avoided and which healthy practices you should turn to instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c94685" class="body-graf"&gt;The liver is a remarkable organ. Among its many functions, it rids our blood of toxins, disposes of old cells, metabolizes nutrients and creates the fluid necessary for digestion. And it rarely needs assistance with any of its hundreds of jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57db7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, a host of cleanses and supplements are available online and in stores, with claims they can detoxify the liver, thereby improving its function. But there’s no clinical evidence to support that they work, Dr. Raymond Chung, chief of gastroenterology, hepatology and endoscopy at Mass General Brigham, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a2597" class="body-graf"&gt;In fact, some have been linked to liver damage and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-449556" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Have I Ever: Done a Liver Cleanse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-537b2d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s only natural to think that being good to our bodies is to find things like supplements that ostensibly reduce the stress to our livers,” Chung tells TODAY.com. But your liver likely doesn’t need any additional help, which is why he’s never done a liver cleanse or taken a liver supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de45b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Plus, he has safety concerns around the many products that are available. That's in part because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't vet the safety of dietary supplements before they hit shelves (though it can take action against supplement makers after if a dangerous one reaches the market).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b62db8" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/bad-supplements-list-rcna209561" target="_blank"&gt;Certain types of supplements can be especially risky&lt;/a&gt; to liver health, such as black cohosh, kava and vitamin A, TODAY.com previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ac8263" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-056ce5" class="body-graf"&gt;While the liver can incur damage from disease, viruses and lifestyle choices, a detox likely won’t be the fix — and in some cases, they may even make things worse. “Several herbal and dietary supplements have been linked to liver injury, damage or even liver failure,” Chung points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa4bd9" class="body-graf"&gt;“The liver is the ultimate filter and the ultimate detoxifier,” he adds, but taking supplements can actually “overwhelm that detoxification mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8a7bec" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Do Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1cb86" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’ve already taken liver cleanses and supplements, don’t fret. “(The liver) is a sturdy, hardy organ,” with regenerative capacities, says Chung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25aec0" class="body-graf"&gt;To keep it functioning at its best, avoid liver supplements and focus on a few lifestyle practices, he advises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44d9cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news about the liver is that it is such an extraordinarily forgiving organ,” says Chung. “So even if liver damage somehow occurred during the period of exposure to a supplement, in most cases, with removal of the injurious agent, we will see regression of that injury.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b32468" class="body-graf"&gt;Moving forward, focus on a healthy diet. Chung recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362"&gt;Mediterranean diet,&lt;/a&gt; which promotes healthy fats, lean protein, antioxidants, whole grains and produce. This diet has been shown to lower the risk of death, lower levels of heart disease and boost digestive health. Chung is a fan because it lessens the accumulation of fat in the liver — a benefit since &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fatty-liver-diet-rcna140012"&gt;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; is the leading cause of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-49cb36" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;He also advises fitting as much movement as you can into your day, and drinking alcohol in moderation, especially if you have liver disease, since it can inflame the liver and destroy its cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQcTYwRzJRS3pWRHRkVXZ1cUF1UER6eXJoZHQtMW1UNHhHUHEyQjk2ZUtpeWZ0cWRVOGJWUmNkeWRBcWNGUGdLdXkyc1E1N24yVFFKVlYtMG01Q1JtWUxsVndqLXBfQzJxUVlJZEpXRmxhRHNRX0ktZW9wT1N2OWdjU1hORjBLazZ5eWxUWGRYc2JMUlpQS1M3M21td9IBVEFVX3lxTE9DVXFyU2RFUS0xeHBlZWxRQmdrdXYwTF9LM1Q3VWFUWjdiNVhFQ284MWNZWE5saWpib1V6S2k1LU80aTBtaWh5N0hXcmoxT0VEallhYg</guid></item><item><title>研究：晚点吃早餐可能危害您的健康-预防</title><link>https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a66043546/eating-breakfast-late-dangerous-for-health-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We’ve all heard the saying that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g35362654/what-to-eat-for-breakfast/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g35362654/what-to-eat-for-breakfast/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breakfast" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is the most important meal of the day.

Shifts in meal time might not only reflect underlying health problems but could also influence circadian rhythms, which help regulate things like sleep and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Even though more research is needed, keeping a consistent breakfast routine could be one simple step toward supporting healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQbjRfR2toSVJyd1d6bVVrcElucHRqVmJVR2dBZE11Zll5aEVVUTR5Q3EzWUNMSDBXTF9Gdmx5NUY5OVlpcXN0ZHV1ak5jaHl4UFo3eEtSOGxaekhucEVoeVhOaHVtSEtZUV9tYXdkRVBsWTlEUE5XT1dLem9zb0owZ0x3R3ZXZjk4dmNOckFuSmEyUk43WmM0Sjd4c3JNcWJzLWlF</guid></item><item><title>如果您超过60岁，这种常见的早餐习惯可能会给您的心脏带来额外的压力- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/common-breakfast-habit-could-putting-182500175.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re 60 or older, there are certain habits that you’ve likely had in place for decades—for better or for worse.

When this happens, he says, it sets the stage for issues like elevated blood pressure or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-do-daily-to-lower-ldl-cholesterol-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:abnormal cholesterol levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;abnormal cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. He adds that this happens before symptoms (like headaches, dizziness, chest discomfort or shortness of breath) start occurring, so someone may be completely unaware that their blood pressure and cholesterol levels have reached unhealthy levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-heart-health-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cardiologists Warn That This Is the #1 Worst Habit for You Heart (And What To Do Instead);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cardiologists Warn That This Is the #1 Worst Habit for You Heart (And What To Do Instead)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to raising blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/estelle-darlyse-jean-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Estelle Jean, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Estelle Jean, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a cardiologist and the president of medical staff at MedStar Montgomery Medical Center, says that eating sausage or bacon every day for breakfast can increase inflammation in the body and also lead to weight gain, both of which are detrimental to heart health. She also points out that if someone is filling up on fatty meats, they likely are missing out on the essential nutrients in minerals that other breakfast foods could provide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fatty meats are eaten regularly long-term, the risks become even more dangerous. &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jennifer Wong, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jennifer Wong, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and the medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California, says that the long term risks include heart attacks, stroke, renal failure and dementia. (PSA: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6918828/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What’s bad for your heart is also bad for your brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What’s bad for your heart is also bad for your brain&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sondergaard explains that the reason why the risk of heart attack and stroke increases if processed meats are eaten regularly long term is a result of a combination of sodium, preservatives and saturated fats these foods contain. “[It] can accelerate the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which narrow the blood vessels and increase the likelihood of blockages, heart attack or stroke,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-many-minutes-should-you-walk-per-day-to-boost-heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exactly How Many Minutes of Walking You Need To Do Per Day To Boost Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Exactly How Many Minutes of Walking You Need To Do Per Day To Boost Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cardiologists Share What To Eat Instead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides minimizing consumption of processed meats like sausage and bacon, Dr. Jeans says that other breakfast foods that should be minimized for better cardiovascular health include butter, baked goods and fried foods. “Croissants, muffins and donuts are often high in saturated fats and added sugars, making them a less heart-healthy breakfast option,” she warns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sondergaard agrees, saying that eating these breakfast foods occasionally is fine, but eating them regularly may raise LDL cholesterol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of getting your protein from processed meats, Dr. Jean says that better heart-healthy options include &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/greek-yogurt-bites" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Greek yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, egg whites, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/best-cottage-cheese" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cottage cheese;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;, smoked salmon, tofu and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/best-natural-peanut-butter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nut butter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nut butter&lt;/a&gt;. “These options provide essential nutrients, support cardiovascular health and offer a variety of tasty choices to start your day,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/day-of-heart-healthy-eating-according-to-a-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Jean, fiber and unsaturated fats are two other nutrients that support heart health. She says that eating fiber-rich foods in the morning, like &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/gwyneth-paltrow-oatmeal-with-orange-juice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, whole-grain toast, fruits or vegetables, can help lower LDL cholesterol numbers and have the added benefit of supporting digestive health. In terms of foods with unsaturated fats, Dr. Jean says that &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1115442/parade/avocado-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avocado;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;, nuts and seeds are all great foods to consider making part of your breakfast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The key is balance. Choosing heart-healthy proteins and pairing them with fiber-rich fruits, vegetables and whole grains for breakfast can contribute to a heart-healthy lifestyle,” Dr. Sondergaard shares.

                Robert Ochweda and Millicent Akoth is HIV positive — she caught the virus from her former husband. She is now married to Robert Ochweda, a fisherman who is HIV negative. After the two of them fell in love, he says he was afraid to marry her lest he contract the virus. "I have been able to stay safe by using condoms and PrEP," Ochweda explains, referring to a pill that prevents infection. In the wake of U.S. foreign aid cuts, they say it's become harder to find the pills and condoms that keep them safe.

   &lt;p&gt;Let's say you fall in love with someone harboring a deadly -- and highly infectious -- virus. And you think … is it crazy to get married?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sometimes love conquers all — with the help of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the story of serodiscordant couples — the term used when one partner is HIV positive and the other is HIV negative.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Robert Ochweda and Millicent Akoth of Kenya are one such couple. She is HIV positive — she caught the virus from her former husband. He is a fisherman who is HIV negative. After the two of them fell in love, he says he was afraid to marry her lest he contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He was able to overcome his fears.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I have been able to stay safe by using condoms and PrEP," Ochweda explains, referring to a pill that prevents infection. And The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention writes: "Most condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His wife takes antiretroviral pills that reduce her viral load, so she does not face the risk of death from AIDS. Those pills also reduce the risk that she will infect her husband.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year, couples in this category are especially anxious. They say that, in the wake of the Trump administration's dramatic foreign aid cuts and dismantling of USAID, the agency that supported health-related programs, it's become harder to find the pills and condoms that keep them safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82272" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Caleb Ochieng, who is HIV negative, has been married to DIana Odhiambo, who is HIV positive, for eight years. They have two children. On a recent visit to pick up his PrEP drugs that reduce his risk of infection, he says, "I was told the supply that was available has been reserved for pregnant women."

   &lt;p&gt;Caleb Ochieng, who is HIV negative, has been married to Diana Odhiambo, who is HIV positive, for eight years. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ochieng learned of Odhiambo's HIV status when they went to do an HIV test as they made plans to tie the knot after several years of cohabiting. She believes she contracted the disease from a previous relationship.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were shocked because at that time we had two children and wanted others. We were advised on preventive measures like condom use and voluntary male circumcision as a way of preventing HIV infection," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I wondered how we would manage," he recalls. "It's not been easy but with love, we have been taking care of ourselves." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Odhiambo takes pills to suppress the virus; he takes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to stay safe. He is tested for HIV every three months. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Taking these precautions, the couple has had two children who are HIV negative. After counseling, Odhiambo has become a peer educator who talks to other couples in the same situation.  The partner who is positive, he reflects, "has a lot of emotions. AS a partner, you should be there for them and support them well."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a recent visit to the clinic where he picks up his PrEP drugs, he says, "I was told the supply that was available has been reserved for pregnant women. I traveled to neighboring Busia county and managed to get a small dose that could last a month and a half."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His experience echoes a memo from the State Department that NPR obtained, stating that if a clinic receives funding through the U.S. program PEPFAR, this preventative medication can "only" be given to "pregnant and breastfeeding women" during the 90-day freeze on foreign aid that the Trump administration instituted — and that is still in effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A senior health official with the Kenyan Ministry of Health told NPR that clinics have been rationing medications and other supplies because of the uncertainties about donor funds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We acquire most of the HIV medication through partners and donors. The exit of U.S. funding means that there is a gap, and until that gap is filled, there is always bound to be friction but the government has done everything to keep operations going," says the official, who asked not to be identified by name because he did not have permission to speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Joywine Adek, a programs officer at &lt;a href="https://www.mildmay.org/kenya" target="_blank"&gt;Mildmay Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that supports HIV patients, is seeing this gap.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mildmay Kenya is among the organizations that was receiving funding from the U.S. government to support HIV interventions in Kenya, including screening services, distribution of antiretroviral drugs and condoms, and counseling for serodiscordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In the current grant that is available after the reduction in funding, there is no support for discordant couples," Adek says, adding that the charity has had to halt many of its services because of the loss of U.S. aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are trying to sort this out by doing what we call integration of HIV care into routine health care," says Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kenya's Kisumu County.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lack of condoms is evident. This reporter saw empty dispensers where co Kndoms were once stocked and made available in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82267" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;And even though condoms are inexpensive — as little as $1 or $2 each in the U.S., even less in Kenya — that price could still be daunting in a country where a third of the population lives below the poverty line of about $2 a day in income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kenya has previously reported that the supply of condoms was not equal to the demand. But this year, officials say, things are worse than ever in the wake of the U.S. foreign aid shakeup, which has affected some of the suppliers, like the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, UNFPA noted: "Kenya has historically relied heavily on USAID for its free condom distribution programs. Kenya's annual condom requirement is estimated at 400–450 million units. Condom procurement by UNFPA has been affected indirectly — but nonetheless significantly - by U.S. funding cuts. While UNFPA continues its role in condom programming through funding from other global partners, the U.S. stop work order has contributed to shortfalls in supply, putting more pressure on UNFPA and other providers. Some 9.8 million UNFPA-procured condoms were received at the Kenya Central Stores on August 13, 2025, but funding restrictions from the U.S. and other donors mean there is uncertainty as to whether UNFPA will be able to meet projected condom procurement needs for 2026 and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR asked the State Department to respond to these points about U.S. funding and free condom programs but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result of this altered aid landscape is that partners with different HIV status are living with newfound uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82273" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                "The shortage of the drugs and condoms is a major concern for us, and the government is yet to address our concerns," says Erastus Ng'uono, who is HIV positive and married to Winnie Auma Miyare, who is HIV negative. The couple is standing in front of their home with two of their children, a boy named Rain and a baby girl named Rose. Says Ng'uono: "I don't know what the future holds."

   &lt;p&gt;Erastus Ng'uono was born with HIV positive status. When he met Winnie Auma Miyare and wanted to start a relationship with her, he asked her if she could love someone who is HIV positive and using ARVs. A few days later, he told her about his HIV status. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first she did not want to have anything to do with him. But when he explained how medications could help her ward off infection, she changed her mind. She takes PrEP pills. They have four children who are all HIV negative. Their youngest is six months old. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news of U.S. aid cuts that could affect the strategies they use has hit them hard. "I encouraged him to have courage and not to worry," she says. "I know the government will intervene." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very afraid," he says. "I even prayed over it and I know God will see us through."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still he worries. "The shortage of the drugs and condoms is a major concern for us and the government is yet to address our concerns," says Ng'uono.

He had heard some people were getting prescriptions for the shots, but when he called his doctor’s office, they wouldn’t even make an appointment for a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;North Carolina is one of several states where pharmacists are requiring prescriptions before administering any shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In some states, pharmacists are prevented by law from administering vaccines that are not recommended by the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP). While doctors have liability protections for Covid vaccines under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (Prep) Act, pharmacists may not if the vaccines are not approved by the advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some insurers might also opt not to cover the shots until they are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The independent advisers are expected to take up Covid recommendations at the next meeting in mid-September, but that meeting has been embroiled in controversy. Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, called for an &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;indefinite postponement&lt;/a&gt; given the recent upheaval at health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Shipman said: “It’s incredibly frustrating, because this has significant consequences for public health, and there is no reason in the world for this to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is an entirely manufactured problem that is going to cost people their health and wellbeing and possibly their lives. It is manifestly clear that people who would like the Covid vaccine are not able to access it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Changing the rules to make vaccination easier will depend on the state, said Lindsay Wiley, a professor of law and faculty director of the health law and policy program at UCLA Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In several states, governors and health officials are solving the prescription problem pretty swiftly, so it’s a rapidly evolving situation right now. In other states, the legislature may need to take action to fix the problem,” Wiley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even states that have tried to combat the confusion still have vaccine challenges. The state of Maryland released &lt;a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Maryland-Protects-Access-to-Vaccines-for-All-Marylanders.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; last week for all residents to access vaccines – without specifying the need to disclose qualifying conditions. Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, called the federal changes to vaccine policy “harmful for Marylanders and all Americans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet when Ian Morgan tried to obtain the vaccine in Maryland, the pharmacist said it could only be administered to those over the age of 65 or people with at least one underlying health condition. Morgan tried to make an appointment online, but was told CVS couldn’t schedule his appointment because he did not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and a union steward of NIH Fellows United-UAW 2750, said the tumult has been caused by Kennedy’s messaging on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think the chaos is the point, and that chaos has consequences,” Morgan said. “Creating this confusion, creating this chaos, trying to discredit scientific experts – and we see that every time [Kennedy] goes out there – that in and of itself is causing problems, and that in itself is harming the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f1f7cf35-b4f9-47ab-aad7-e55e9cb97247" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Workers log a shipment of Covid vaccines in Horsham, Pennsylvania.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morgan is one of 1,000 current and former HHS employees who signed a &lt;a href="https://www.savehhs.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; calling for Kennedy’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccine availability for children, especially for those under the age of five, has lagged even further behind adults as pediatricians struggle to understand new limitations and potential legal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Joanne Hilden, a retired physician, has been searching for the updated vaccines for her four grandchildren, who are between the ages three and 12, in Minnesota.

Pharmacies have not received the pediatric doses yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are also immense structural barriers that make it harder for marginalized people to access the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Julia Lynch, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, first made plans to get vaccinated in Oakland, New Jersey, a 45-minute drive from her home in Philadelphia, before the state board of pharmacy gave pharmacies the go-ahead to vaccinate Pennsylvanians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CVS pharmacies near her home had no appointments, so she ended up driving to a predominantly white suburb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know why it is that the vaccines are getting to those CVSes first,” she said. But that means “if you’re Black or Latino, you are less likely than if you’re white to live close to someplace where you can get a vaccine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-27" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traveling to Oakland by public transit would have taken more than two hours on three buses and one regional train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Eligibility right now is obviously limited to people who are over 65 or who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk,” Lynch said. “These are exactly the people who are most likely to have trouble traveling four-plus hours on a multimodal public transit journey to get their Covid shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not everyone has reliable internet access, the technological knowledge to book appointments, or the ability to take time off work or find childcare to locate and travel to appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For people who are not chronically online, it’s a major undertaking to do all this,” Lynch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fighting to have the shots covered by insurance, or paying out of pocket for the uninsured, is another major hurdle, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rachel, who lives in Pittsburgh and asked to be identified by her first name to protect her health history, has two autoimmune disorders and a genetic blood clotting disorder that puts her at high risk if she gets sick with Covid. She said she would like to get the latest Covid shot, but is planning to wait for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The challenges right now for me are just around information, and actually knowing what is the truth and what is going to happen if I try to get it,” she said. She said she had heard of people being turned away from pharmacies even after the Pennsylvania vaccine announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It just sounds like it’s still a shitshow. It’s still challenging to make an appointment here, so I’m going to wait a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rachel said it reminded her of 2021, when many people scrambled to get their first Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s just frustrating to me that based on absolutely zero evidence, and in some cases, just making up lies about evidence, [the] HHS has just decided these are so dangerous that we need to limit them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah, who lives in Westchester county, New York, and asked to be identified by her first name so she is not harassed by anti-vaccine activists, said she was finally able to get the shot after days of effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In New York, she needed a prescription. That later changed when Kathy Hochul, the governor, &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;opened&lt;/a&gt; up access to all New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The faxed prescription never went through, so her health system had to set up an electronic prescription system. Sarah asked that her doctor prescribe any Covid vaccine; she said she overheard the pharmacist denying one prescription because it was for the Pfizer vaccine and they only had Moderna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even after the prescription was received, the pharmacist said he needed verbal confirmation from the doctor by phone as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah said she paid $250 out of pocket, and has since spent hours on the phone with her insurance company to be reimbursed. After she paid, the pharmacist tried to dissuade her from getting the shot, Sarah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Do you really know what you’re getting into? This is brand new,” she recalls him saying. She responded: “I know – that’s why I want it.” But he told her they “don’t know anything” about the updated vaccines and “we don’t know what’s gonna happen” to her once she received it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The roadblocks were “wearing me down”, Sarah said. “It’s trying to make it inaccessible, impossible, confusing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Shipman in North Carolina was dogged in his search, even looking at appointments in other states. Eventually, he was able to receive the vaccine at an urgent care center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But not everyone is able to track down the vaccine and overcome these obstacles, Lynch said. “It’s really hard for ordinary people who are very busy and not necessarily paying close attention to this to know what they’re supposed to do to keep themselves or their loved ones safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 10:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5aenlhSG9hSV8zOW5oSWpzUmdXZW9xeGxnRWowV0dieGRicEY0NXhfMk01aEdfSUxqLXVqTUtrXzh1Y2hRWmlEbUs2a2lKaGpVRGJVSDdRTXZQY2JPYlRjcEdkSTlPdnJVVDlwa01fM09URGRhQlRna0NnaDc</guid></item><item><title>医生、护士、药房、诊所：一名癌症患者为接种疫苗而斗争- AJC.com</title><link>https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/09/doctors-nurses-pharmacy-clinic-one-cancer-patients-fight-to-get-vaccinated/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;main class="w-full mx-auto pb-24 primary-text-color bg-white c-articleBodyContainer type-story"&gt;&lt;header data-pagezone="article-body" class="bg-primary-black py-8"&gt;&lt;div class="max-w-[750px] px-5 md:mx-auto lg:max-w-[814px] lg:px-0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a class="inline-block font-bold tracking-normal uppercase font-primary pb-[5px] text-[11px] text-[#dadada]" href="/news/health-news/"&gt;Health News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="font-worksans text-muted-foreground pt-4 text-[13px] leading-4 font-bold tracking-[-0.44px] sm:text-[14px] sm:leading-5 sm:tracking-[-.5pm]"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anne Goyette, who has leukemia, faced 10 days of delays trying to get a COVID booster amid confusion over RFK Jr.’s vaccine policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-5"&gt;&lt;figure class="group/image relative mb-0 h-full w-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anne Goyette, who has leukemia, is at grave danger if she gets COVID-19, and is eligible for the vaccine booster.

She felt lost. She felt like a fraud. Part of her had always felt an aching imposter syndrome and a difficulty controlling her emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She knew she needed therapy. What she didn’t expect was an &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/10/13/what-is-adhd/71127137007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ADHD diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She thought back to the boys of her elementary school days, bouncing in their seats and unable to keep still. But that didn’t describe her at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone examined the criticism she faced throughout her life from teachers and family members who told her she was lazy, careless and gave up too easily, she writes in her new book &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/735723/nowhere-girl-by-carla-ciccone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“Nowhere Girl: Life as a Member of ADHD’s Lost Generation”&lt;/a&gt; (out now from The Dial Press).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/USAT/86073434007-carla-ciccone-credit-jenna-wakani.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Carla Ciccone is the author of &amp;quot;Nowhere Girl: Life as a Member of ADHD's Lost Generation.&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Carla Ciccone is the author of &amp;quot;Nowhere Girl: Life as a Member of ADHD's Lost Generation.&amp;quot;" data-c-credit="Jenna Wakani"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hyperactive ADHD – the more commonly studied type – is only one part of the story. Inattentive ADHD, on the other hand, is driven by difficulty sustaining attention and focus rather than impulsivity or need for constant movement. Think daydreamers. It’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7561166/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;more common in women&lt;/a&gt; than in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone isn’t alone. In 2023, a study published in Epic Research found the &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/articles/stimulant-prescribing-rates-remain-steady-for-patients-with-adhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;number of newly diagnosed women&lt;/a&gt; between ages 23-29 and 30-49 nearly doubled from 2020 to 2022. As Ciccone argues in her book, a lack of comprehensive research and attention to ADHD in women and girls has created a “lost generation” she dubs the “Nowhere Girls.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Meet the ‘big, chaotic sisterhood’ of girls left out of ADHD research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once diagnosed, Ciccone craved answers. She undertook a personal and academic deep dive to discover why so many women grew up undiagnosed. She interviewed those who had been diagnosed later in life, many only after their children were diagnosed with the genetic disorder. She wanted an explanation for all the times she felt she was doing “life” wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/?srsltid=AfmBOors5MNHNFcP-dxh3cKBUF-TPyNA5n1wz5YYX_ubQmlPF4j2aRrm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Symptoms of inattentive ADHD&lt;/a&gt; include inability to sustain attention during tasks, mind wandering, careless mistakes, losing things, easily distracted by external stimuli or unrelated thoughts and forgetfulness, according to &lt;a href="https://www.additudemag.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ADHD Magazine ADDitude&lt;/a&gt;. People with it can get overstimulated easily and sometimes struggle to control their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Although the word &lt;em&gt;inattentive&lt;/em&gt; implies a lack of attention, it’s a misnomer,” Ciccone writes. “People with inattentive ADHD can pay attention, and if something is of special interest to us, we display intense focus, but we lack the internal regulation required to make decisions about how and when to deploy our attention.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While ADHD diagnoses are rising, it’s not just because more people have ADHD. Part of the reason is that professionals are getting better at recognizing symptoms. In the past, the general thinking was that girls couldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; ADHD and they were misdiagnosed in adolescence with anxiety or depression. Black women, especially, are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/black-women-bias-adhd-diagnosis/2021/07/16/1784cda2-df22-11eb-9f54-7eee10b5fcd2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;under- and misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; compared to their white male peers, the Washington Post reported in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone was frustrated to find research was largely focused on boys. She eventually found &lt;a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/stephen-hinshaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Stephen Hinshaw&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at UC Berkley and one of the leading researchers on ADHD in women and girls, who is trying to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Sadly, it's a common story in the medical field that women and girls get overlooked until it's too late,” Ciccone tells USA TODAY. “Then they go, ‘Oops, I guess you better study you. I guess your bodies work differently.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gender can play a big role in ADHD diagnosis. “Gendered socialization” – the ways we internalize societal expectations from a young age (like dolls and trucks at playtime) – puts girls with undiagnosed ADHD at a disadvantage. There’s pressure to be a quiet, polite girl. As Ciccone writes in the book, “emotional dysregulation becomes especially tricky because we become more and more beholden to gender expectations that say it’s inappropriate to display intense feelings.” Sometimes, they’re identified as “gifted” kids and are often perfectionists. They may appear to be listening, even if they aren’t. They’re often given more responsibility in the classroom than their male counterparts. They learn to mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/USAT/86073452007-9780593729519.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=448&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt='"Nowhere Girl" is out now from the Dial Press at Penguin Random House.'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='"Nowhere Girl" is out now from the Dial Press at Penguin Random House.' data-c-credit="Penguin Random House"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“In elementary school in the ‘90s, boys were expected to act out to a certain degree and be aggressive and loud and disruptive. And that’s not to say that they had a good experience of that, they still get corrected. But if a girl does it, she gets corrected in a different way, in a way that goes (at) her self-esteem,” Ciccone says. “‘You’re a girl, and you’re supposed to be good.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They learn coping mechanisms to skate by schooling “at the cost of a lot of anxiety and a lot of stress,” Hinshaw told Ciccone for “Nowhere Girl.” Those skills (and supportive families, if they have them) can act as scaffolding against exacerbated ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/adhd-what-you-need-to-know" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Inattentive symptoms typically persist with age&lt;/a&gt;, while hyperactive ADHD symptoms often decline, according to the National Institutes of Health. So when that scaffolding falls away – with larger class loads in high school or college, in their first professional job, after having a baby – it all comes crashing down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Carla Ciccone's ADHD diagnosis gave her a ‘reason to forgive’ herself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When the pandemic wreaked havoc on the world, “we lost our support," Ciccone says. "ADHD people, we can be chaotic but we do sort of thrive when we have a routine. And so when we lost that, I think a lot of us were just alone with our brains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the pandemic also opened up different avenues for support, like telehealth. Ciccone found success with online therapy. Once she got her diagnosis, it led to a chapter of reflection and, ultimately, forgiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The emotional dysregulation that leads to this sense of shame that is really persistent and really, really hard to shake, even when you do know where it’s stemming from … it’s very hard to get away from that,” Ciccone says. Many of the women she spoke with felt overwhelmed, like she had, which led to a feeling of "I can’t handle life the way that other people can and therefore I’m not worthy of my position in the world.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone began to give herself grace for the things she used to hate about herself. She looked at her younger, undiagnosed self with compassion. She started listening to her body and letting herself move when she felt restless.

&lt;h3&gt;A new study suggests that psychological well-being may be crucial for healthy aging.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/"&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt;, regions where people commonly live to older ages, suggest that a &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/news/purpose-adds-years-to-your-life/#:~:text=Centenarians%20living%20in%20%E2%80%9CBlue%20Zones%E2%80%9D%20areas%E2%80%94places%20where,Purpose%20workshops%20have%20started%20in%20Dodge%20County."&gt;strong sense of purpose&lt;/a&gt; is linked with longer life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research from &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/uc-davis/"&gt;UC Davis&lt;/a&gt; indicates that purpose may offer another advantage as people get older: a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, tracked more than 13,000 adults aged 45 and above for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who reported a higher sense of purpose were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_493962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493962" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-493962" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-777x1166.jpg" alt="Aliza Wingo" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-777x1166.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-400x600.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-150x225.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-450x675.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-1200x1800.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aliza-Wingo-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Aliza Wingo, senior author of the study, is a professor in the UC Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.

&lt;p&gt;The protective effect of having a purpose was seen across racial and ethnic groups. It also remained significant even after accounting for education, depression and the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/study-reveals-how-apoe4-gene-may-increase-risk-dementia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gene, which is a known risk factor for &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Alzheimer’s&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Alzheimer&amp;amp;#039;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects older adults, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia. The disease is characterized by the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which disrupt cell function and communication. There is currently no cure, and treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Purpose in life helps the brain stay resilient&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,” said Aliza Wingo, senior author and professor in the UC Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. “Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were not specifically asked about the activities that gave their life purpose. Previous studies on aging, though, have found a wide range of activities give older adults a sense of life purpose, sometimes referred to as “&lt;a href="https://www.japan.go.jp/kizuna/2022/03/ikigai_japanese_secret_to_a_joyful_life.html"&gt;ikigai&lt;/a&gt;.” These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/the-importance-of-connections-ways-to-live-a-longer-healthier-life/"&gt;Relationships&lt;/a&gt;: Caring for family, spending time with grandchildren, or supporting a spouse or friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/60/3/460/5530371"&gt;Work&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/07/230720124958.htm"&gt;volunteering&lt;/a&gt;: Continuing professional work, mentoring, or contributing to community causes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-15815-028"&gt;Spirituality or faith&lt;/a&gt;: Religious beliefs, spiritual practices or involvement in faith-based communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02506-1"&gt;Personal goals&lt;/a&gt;: Pursuing hobbies, learning new skills, or setting and achieving personal milestones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2025/08/14/helping-others-shown-to-slow-cognitive-decline/"&gt;Helping others&lt;/a&gt;: Acts of kindness, philanthropy, caregivin,g or advocacy work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Purpose delays onset of cognitive decline&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that people with higher purpose tended to experience cognitive decline later than those with lower purpose. On average, the delay in onset was very modest — about 1.4 months over an eight-year period, after considering the effects of age, education, depressive symptoms, and genetic risk. However, it is meaningful when compared to current treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While medications like &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/lecanemab-leqembi"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/donanemab"&gt;donanemab&lt;/a&gt; can modestly delay symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, they come with risks and costs,” said Nicholas C. Howard, first author and public health researcher at UC Davis. “Purpose in life is free, safe, and accessible. It’s something people can build through relationships, goal,s and meaningful activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Methods and limitations of study&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study were part of the &lt;a href="https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about"&gt;Health and Retirement Study&lt;/a&gt;, a nationally representative survey funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;. All had normal cognitive health at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a seven-item survey from the &lt;a href="https://sparqtools.org/mobility-measure/psychological-wellbeing-scale/"&gt;Ryff Measures of Psychological Well-being&lt;/a&gt;. Participants had six possible responses (from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”) for statements such as: “I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself” and “I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life.” Their answers were scored and averaged to obtain a well-being number between 1 and 6, with higher values indicating a strong sense of purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their cognitive health was tracked using a telephone-based test every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted the study has many strengths, including the size of the population studied. However, a key limitation is that although there was an association, the study did not prove higher levels of purpose caused the lowered rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Findings support role of psychological well-being&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the findings support the idea that psychological well-being plays a key role in healthy aging, said Thomas Wingo, a co-author of the study and a professor and neurologist at UC Davis Health. Wingo hopes future studies will explore whether purpose-building interventions can help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s exciting about this study is that people may be able to ‘think’ themselves into better health. Purpose in life is something we can nurture,” he said. “It’s never too early — or too late — to start thinking about what gives your life meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

For decades, the treatment was mainly palliative. Patients would take a heaping amount of drugs to improve their breathing and ability to process food. Some used devices to inhale medicated mist or create sound waves to loosen mucus in their lungs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Trikafta, which was developed at Vertex’s San Diego laboratory and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019, focuses on repairing the mucus proteins as they form in the cell, as opposed to most prior research, which sought to treat the disease by changing the defective gene, the foundation said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The lesson here is to understand the cause of the disease and go right at it,” Negulescu said. “It might take longer and be more difficult, but this is proof that it works.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Globally, two-thirds of people diagnosed with CF are being treated with the Vertex drug, according to the company. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38558542/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38558542/"&gt;many in low- and middle-income countries&lt;/a&gt; can’t afford the drug due to its hefty price tag of $300,000 a year, which is paid for primarily by private insurers and reimbursement agreements in rich countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vrtx.com/medicines/cystic-fibrosis-facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.vrtx.com/medicines/cystic-fibrosis-facts-and-figures/"&gt;The company said&lt;/a&gt; it recognized accessibility challenges and has established a pilot donation program to provide CF medication to eligible people. The program is now available in 14 countries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our goal is that everyone with CF has effective medication,” Negulescu said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While continuing research on CF, Negulescu and the Vertex team are also developing nonopioid pain therapeutics. In January, the FDA approved Vertex’s medication for moderate to acute pain, Journavx, which was released to the market in March. As of mid-July, more than 110,000 prescriptions were filled across the country, according to the company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

A vaccine had been available since 1982 and recommended for those deemed to be at highest risk, such as health care workers and men who have sex with men. But the infection rates had gone up, not down. When epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dug into the data, they noticed one figure that had stayed alarmingly stable: Between 30% and 40% of hepatitis B patients had no identifiable risk factors at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When they published &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/380888" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt; in 1990, it was subtitled, “Need for Alternative Vaccination Strategies.” The next year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — the CDC body that sets such guidelines — recommended vaccinating all infants. Over the next two decades, case numbers &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt; by 99% among children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, under the Trump administration, some members of the ACIP have hinted at a desire to reverse course when the committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;next&lt;/a&gt; convenes on Sept. 18 and 19, as part of a broader review of childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the last meeting in June, after health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 experts who sat on the committee and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; them with his own picks, the new chair, Martin Kulldorff, expressed doubts about the current advice. “Is it wise to administer a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to every newborn before leaving the hospital? That’s the question,” he said. “Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To people who study, treat, or have hepatitis B, that argument is dangerously misguided, and if adopted, they warn it could lead to a resurgence of the virus as well as the liver disease and cancer it causes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m speechless. It’s a failure to recognize why that strategy was put into place,” said Miriam Alter, the first author of that 1990 study, now retired from the CDC and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. If that argument is taken up by the committee, she went on, “the virus, because it still circulates in the population, will rear its ugly head. We’ll be back in the same situation we were in when we depended upon risk-factor-based screening.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One reason for giving the first vaccine dose on the first day of life, and the next doses soon after, is that infants are exquisitely vulnerable. A newly minted immune system — still learning what’s foreign and what’s self, not yet able to muster certain protective white blood cells — can allow hepatitis B to run amok, replicating continuously. That &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/4/439" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;happens&lt;/a&gt; to fewer than 10% of people who get infected as adults, to 30% of those who get infected between the ages of 1 and 4, and to a whopping 90% of babies who get infected in the first year. If they’re vaccinated, though, that rate nosedives into the single digits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What you need to do is get their bodies the tools they need for the babies to start fighting the virus as soon as they are exposed,” said Chari Cohen, president of the Hepatitis B Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That exposure can take place before an infant has fully entered the world. Hepatitis B is a blood-borne pathogen, and childbirth, be it vaginal or cesarean, is bloody, with a possibility of mother-to-child transmission. While Sen. Rand Paul (R.-Ky.) &lt;a href="https://x.com/RandPaul/status/1962223758896173407" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently claimed on X&lt;/a&gt; that there is “no medical need to give newborns Hep B vaccine if mother is not infected” because “all mothers who deliver in a hospital are tested,” he was quickly corrected by his Senate colleague Bill Cassidy (R.-La.), who &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1962269409642197050" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted, “Empirically, this is not true.&lt;/a&gt; Not all mothers have prenatal care. Some get infected between testing in the first trimester and delivery. In some cases, the test is overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If infection occurs at birth, there’s a 24-hour window of opportunity. “The vaccine needs to be given immediately to help the newborn develop antibodies to fight off that infection they have just been exposed to,” said John Ward, director of the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination, who led the CDC’s viral hepatitis division from 2005 to 2018. “The longer you wait, then the longer that virus has time to set up shop and resist those antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But early immunization isn’t only helpful in cases of maternal infection. Hepatitis B is extremely infectious, some 50-to-100 times more easily transmissible than HIV, with more of it typically present in blood, meaning that a smaller speck may suffice for the pathogen to be passed on. Su Wang, a New Jersey physician specializing in hepatitis B, has seen young people with so much virus per milliliter of blood that “the lab test couldn’t even quantify it,” and technicians had to dilute the specimen in order to get a read. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means that a child’s risk doesn’t end once they come home from the hospital: Transmission can happen in the household or at day care, in the infinitesimal-seeming blood exposure that might stem from a razor nick or shared toothbrush, a bite or scratch from another kid. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Wang is a case in point. She was diagnosed with hepatitis B in her first year of college, when she signed up to donate blood, and she assumed she’d gotten it from her mom. But when her mom got tested, it came back negative. Her maternal grandparents, on the other hand, tested positive. They’d lived with Wang’s family when she was little, and Wang imagines that they may have been her source of exposure, but can’t be sure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those cases of early-childhood transmission are rare in the United States, but the consequences can be dire. Often, the virus lurks silently in the liver. It triggers inflammation that kills cells, which means someone may end up needing a transplant. But it also hijacks the genetic machinery and increases the likelihood of mutations. “We hear these stories all the time. Someone wakes up with tremendous pain in their side, they go to the emergency room, and by the end of the day, they’re told they have liver cancer,” Cohen said. “They don’t find out they have hep B until after they’re diagnosed with liver cancer, and they live for six weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such horrible outcomes are part of the calculus behind a “birth dose.” While critics of the strategy point out that some countries such as Denmark don’t vaccinate against hepatitis B until later in infancy, American researchers respond that the setting is quite different: Unlike European countries with smaller populations and universal health care systems, the United States has no unified public health apparatus that tracks every baby born and every intervention they receive. Prenatal care falls through the cracks; childhood visits fall through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other issues emerge when trying to screen or vaccinate adults based on their risk, as was recommended in the 1980s. If patients get to the doctor’s office at all, doctors may not think to ask about risk factors. Even if they do, patients might not feel comfortable disclosing their histories of sexual encounters and drug use, for instance, given the potential for stigma. Plus, by then, it might be too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How do you identify individuals before they become ‘at risk’? You can’t,” said Alter. “That’s why immunizing young children was such a successful strategy. Because, by doing that, you immunize the population before they develop risk factors, whatever those risk factors might be.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus, hundreds of millions of people have received the hepatitis B vaccine worldwide, and follow-up studies have shown that it is remarkably safe, with the most common side effects being fever, redness and soreness at the injection site, and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget, when discussing statistics and stratifications of risk, that real people’s lives are at stake. There are antivirals that can help control hepatitis B, but there is no cure. Once people have it, they have it for life. If their immune systems become suppressed, it can roar out of hiding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After she was diagnosed at 21, during a routine screening before a college semester abroad, Wendy Lo sometimes couldn’t bring herself to go to her appointments. She’d likely been infected from her mom at birth; every visit was a painful reminder of the stigma she’d inherited. “Monitoring was doing a number to my psychology,” said Lo, 52, a former tech professional who now works as a fitness coach and hepatitis B advocate. “It’s just telling me I have this blemish. It’s kind of like a scarlet letter, this stain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She eventually did seek care, but at every stage, the virus shadowed her life. She canceled her study abroad program. The need to disclose her status made dating a minefield. Even the mildest of social drinking was off limits, given her elevated risk of liver failure. When she got married, her husband was protected by vaccines but she was terrified of giving the disease to her children. When doctors reassured her, saying that her babies would be safe with the administration of vaccines and other protective proteins, she worried that she might leave them without a mom. “Premature death, that is a very real and perpetual anxiety,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fear was heightened as her uncle died of liver failure caused by hepatitis B. There were jobs and promotions Lo didn’t accept because she worried the stress might be too much for her health, or because the new health insurance wouldn’t cover the hepatitis drugs she needed. There are all sorts of medications she’s avoided so as not to burden her liver. In her 40s, when she was diagnosed with scarring of the liver, she became so anxious she couldn’t eat or sleep or make even the most quotidian decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She’d been born years too early. But she can’t help but splice those two time frames together, and imagine what might’ve happened if she hadn’t gotten the virus, if she’d gone to do that semester abroad in Nanjing, if she’d stayed in China to start her career as planned — all of the worries and complications and curveballs she could have sidestepped with a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiR-93 promotes fatty liver disease, but vitamin B3 can counteract its effects. This discovery suggests a new treatment approach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 30% of people worldwide are affected by metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD), a condition that until recently lacked targeted therapies. In an important breakthrough, scientists have identified a genetic factor that worsens the disease, and notably, the FDA-approved compound shown to be most effective against this factor is vitamin B3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global first was achieved by a collaborative research group led by Professor Jang Hyun Choi of the Department of Life Sciences at UNIST, together with Professor Hwayoung Yun from the College of Pharmacy and Research Institute for Drug Development at Pusan National University (PNU) and Professor Neung Hwa Park from Ulsan University Hospital (UUH). Their work revealed the critical role of microRNA-93 (miR-93), a molecule expressed in the liver, as a genetic regulator influencing the onset and progression of MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Role of miR-93 in liver function&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiR-93 is a type of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;RNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a single-stranded molecule involved in coding, decoding, and regulating gene expression. It acts as a messenger between DNA and protein synthesis and plays crucial roles in both genetic function and viral replication. Variants like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA support different stages of protein assembly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; found in hepatocytes that suppresses the activity of specific target genes. Researchers detected unusually high levels of miR-93 in both human patients with fatty liver disease and in experimental animal models. Molecular studies showed that miR-93 drives lipid buildup, inflammation, and fibrosis by blocking the expression of SIRT1, a gene essential for regulating lipid metabolism in liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists used gene-editing techniques to block miR-93 production in mice, they observed major reductions in liver fat accumulation, along with improved &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; sensitivity and liver function markers. In contrast, mice engineered to overexpress miR-93 displayed more severe impairments in liver metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vitamin B3 as a therapeutic candidate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, screening 150 FDA-approved drugs revealed that niacin (vitamin B3) most effectively suppresses miR-93. Mice treated with niacin showed a significant decrease in hepatic miR-93 levels and a notable increase in SIRT1 activity. The activated SIRT1 restored disrupted lipid metabolism pathways, thereby normalizing liver lipid homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team explained, “This study precisely elucidates the molecular origin of MASLD and demonstrates the potential for repurposing an already approved vitamin compound to modulate this pathway, which has high translational clinical relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added, “Given that niacin is a well-established and safe medication used to treat hyperlipidemia, it holds promise as a candidate for combination therapies targeting miRNA pathways in MASLD.”&lt;/p&gt;
