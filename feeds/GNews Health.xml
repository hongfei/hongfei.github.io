The air was so laden with pollution from coal power plants and cars at the time that it turned the rain toxic. Downpours killed fish, destroyed forests, eroded statues, and damaged buildings, sparking public outcry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Acid rain is a particularly alarming demonstration of the simple adage that what goes up must come down,” former Colorado Senator Gary Hart &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/07/archives/experts-call-acid-rain-growing-problem-in-us.html?searchResultPosition=17"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. “With acid rain,” he said, “what comes down is much worse than what went up — worse in its potential damage to trees and crops, worse in its potential damage to fresh‐water lakes and fish and tourism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A few decades later, acid rain had largely disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div id=":R22rarr6:" class="duet--article--image-gallery-two-up _1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx5"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx8 _1j8uwx7"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A statue on the side of a building that’s been weathered, in part, by acid rain, seen in Leipzig, Germany in 1990.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Richard Baker/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwxa _1j8uwx9"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A forest in Poland that’s been killed off by acid rain.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Christopher Pillitz/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Beginning around 1990, the US and Europe passed legislation that limited the amount of acid-forming pollutants — such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides — that power plants could emit. Laws requiring car manufacturers to put catalytic converters into new vehicles, which reduced harmful emissions, were also taking effect. That brings us to today: While precipitation in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/acid-rain-environment-earth-day/"&gt;some regions&lt;/a&gt; is still unnaturally acidic, on the whole, acid rain is largely a problem of the past and a major environmental success story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, however, there’s another problem with our rain — and it’s even more alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While precipitation has become less acidic, a growing body of evidence suggests that it’s now full of many other pollutants that pose a risk to public health, including microplastics. And unlike the compounds that cause acid rain, these pollutants are almost impossible to get rid of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-new-pollutants-in-our-rain" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new pollutants in our rain &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As government regulators focused on reigning in air pollution, companies were busy generating new sources of pollution, including plastics and PFAS, the so-called &lt;a href="/2022/8/25/23318667/pfas-forever-chemicals-safety-drinking-water"&gt;forever chemicals&lt;/a&gt;. PFAS, which stands for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a large group of compounds used, among other things, to make fabric stain-resistant and pans nonstick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, these modern-era substances — which famously take decades to millennia to degrade — have leached into the environment, reaching every corner of the planet, no matter how tall or deep. Microplastics, PFAS, and some other compounds, such as pesticides, are now so widespread that they’ve essentially become part of our biome, not unlike bacteria or fungi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They’re so common, in fact, that they’re even found in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0335-5"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724075090"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389423011664?via%3Dihub"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; microplastics in rain falling all over the world — even in remote, unpopulated regions. For one 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5819"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science, &lt;/em&gt;researchers documented microplastics in rainwater that fell on several national parks and wilderness areas in the Western US. Most of the plastic bits were microfibers, such as those shed from polyester sweaters or carpeting on the floor of a car. The researchers estimated that more than 1,000 metric tons of plastic from the atmosphere fall on parks in the West each year, including both as rainfall and as dry dust. That’s equivalent to roughly 120 to 300 million plastic water bottles, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The largest source of those microplastics was highways, said Janice Brahney, a biogeochemist at Utah State University who led the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;study. Roads are often littered with plastic waste that gets broken down by cars and kicked up into the air. Those particles are typically lighter than soil, so once they become airborne, they can easily move around in the atmosphere and get grabbed by rain as it falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A gull carrying a piece of trash along the San Gabriel River in Southern California.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Mark Rightmire/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another important source of plastic rain is the ocean, Brahney said. Several million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, much of which breaks down into microplastics. When waves crash on the beach or bubbles burst on the sea surface, it sends microscopic plastic particles into the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plastic rain is an environmental threat that’s harder to fix than the last one. “It’s much worse than the acid rain problem,” Brahney said. “With acid rain, we could stop emitting acid precursors and then acid rain would stop falling. But we can’t stop the microplastic cycle anymore. It’s there and it’s not going away.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The story of PFAS is similarly bleak: Researchers have detected these chemicals in rain across the planet from the US and Sweden to China and even Antarctica, often at levels above drinking water guidelines. For a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104224002678"&gt;study published in 2024&lt;/a&gt; — titled “It’s raining PFAS in South Florida” — researchers analyzed rainwater that fell around Miami and found more than 20 PFAS compounds, including PFOS and PFOA. Although these two PFAS were phased out in the US years ago due to public health concerns, the researchers still found them at concentrations beyond government health advisory levels for drinking water, underscoring the remarkable persistence of forever chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For another &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02765?ref=PDF"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2022, scientists reviewed studies of PFAS in rainwater and similarly found concentrations of these chemicals at levels above what US and Danish regulators say is safe for drinking water. The authors concluded that, based on health advisories, no untreated rainwater would be considered safe to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“For us to get rid of PFAS, we probably have to go back in time,” said Natalia Soares Quinete, a chemist at Florida International University who was involved in the 2024 study. Even though the government is increasingly regulating PFAS, she said, “I don’t see us completely getting rid of those chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that most people — especially in wealthy countries like the US — don’t rely on untreated rainwater. What is concerning is that rain ends up in groundwater, rivers, and reservoirs that feed into municipal water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Treatment plants help a lot, typically &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667010021002432"&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt; upwards of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054062/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of microplastics in water, but some still pass through. A study &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000250"&gt;published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found a small amount of microplastics in bottled water and tap water in France. Similarly, typical filtration plants for municipal water remove some but not all PFAS. Authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geological Survey, a federal agency, estimate that at least 45 percent of the country’s tap water has at least one type of PFAS present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Treatment facilities don’t have the technology to treat all of the microplastic compounds, let alone the technology to measure them, Brahney said. “There are tens of thousands of chemicals involved, and we only understand a fraction of them,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Whether or not you’re at risk from microplastics, PFAS, and other chemicals is all about exposure — how much of those substances you’re breathing in or consuming. There’s not much of them in a single glass of tap or a bottle of water. The problem is that there are many other pathways that these pollutants can take to enter your body, such as through food. And over time they add up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-protect-yourself-from-polluted-rain" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to protect yourself from polluted rain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Avoid drinking untreated rainwater and eating snow, no matter how pristine it looks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you can afford to filter your water, you should. Standard filters like reverse osmosis — which runs water through a semi-permeable membrane — typically remove a large portion of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10054062/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-023-00286-2"&gt;PFAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Opt for tap over bottled water to avoid ingesting microplastics. Tap water is also way &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b00750"&gt;better for the planet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that the human brains contain as much as a typical &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html"&gt;plastic spoon’s worth of microplastic&lt;/a&gt;, by weight. Scientists still don’t understand what impact that might have on human health, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00405-8"&gt;they suspect&lt;/a&gt; that microplastics could be linked to cancer, heart and kidney disease, and Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, nearly all Americans have a measurable amount of PFAS in their blood, &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/hcp/clinical-overview/human-exposure.html"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; US health officials, though concentrations of some of them — including PFOA and PFOS — are declining. On the whole, forever chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/hcp/clinical-overview/health-effects.html"&gt;are associated with&lt;/a&gt; a range of ailments including increased cholesterol, decreases in birth weight, and kidney cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of these contaminants can also be &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2024/11/microplastics-are-sickening-and-killing-wildlife-disrupting-earth-systems/"&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723045643?via%3Dihub"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, which unlike most of us, do rely on untreated water. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/toxicology/articles/10.3389/ftox.2022.1010185/full"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, linked exposure to PFAS to impaired immune systems in alligators. “If we have these contaminants in our rainwater they’re getting into our groundwater,” Brahney said. “They’re infiltrating our soils. Every organism is interacting with rainwater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ultimately, what all of this research reveals is that the planet is dirty, even if the filth can be hard to see. These chemicals are in the rain because they’re abundant in the environment — and they’re in the environment because they’re in the rain. And while there’s ongoing research, we don’t yet fully understand how those pollutants impact our bodies and our ecosystems. We just know they’ll be around for a very, very long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;“To be honest, I cry, because there’s no walking this back,” Brahney said of microplastic pollution. “These particles don’t break down at a time scale that would be relevant. So yeah, we’re not escaping that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE13WUY2WFVndWhmOXVSQXI3SWJyM0dyMXoweHNqdUExSXEwemRJdmFORmtOd2xwVFA2VEhUUUd4aVEyeFlEV3dYVHRndmZyOE9qX0FsU05Ib2RFRmwyQzR1aVFCUF9KUm1lSW9lMjVGNUZMU3RzMk40</guid></item><item><title>Column | Probiotics are often a waste of money.

Proponents claim probiotics can boost your microbiome — the organisms that live inside your gut — and help with digestive issues, immune function and even mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UELL6DJ6OZBKTOBGXLTW6VOCBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the marketing claims about over-the-counter probiotics largely do not match the evidence.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As a gastroenterologist, I rarely advise my patients to start a probiotic — much to their surprise. They’re even more surprised when I tell them that’s part of the evidence-based guidelines: The American Gastroenterological Association &lt;a href="https://gastro.org/news/aga-does-not-recommend-the-use-of-probiotics-for-most-digestive-conditions-2/" target="_blank"&gt;does not recommend&lt;/a&gt; probiotics for most digestive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CXU2LDK6GRADVGCCGB3W3GOR44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, here’s what I do recommend: Eat a fiber-rich diet. This time-tested recommendation remains one of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt;strongest-studied ways&lt;/a&gt; to promote and preserve a healthy microbiome and improve your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5Z24S2BKJBC6PIVTU3MSLEB3WE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Eating a low-fiber diet &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt;leads to the loss&lt;/a&gt; of major categories of bacteria — and once certain groups are lost, they&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4850918/" target="_blank"&gt; can be lost for good&lt;/a&gt;, even if you try later to ramp up fiber intake later. So the time to act is now. The more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4837298/" target="_blank"&gt;diverse your diet&lt;/a&gt;, the more diverse your microbiome, and the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23985870/" target="_blank"&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt; you are. So choose a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/gut-health-microbiome-best-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;variety&lt;/a&gt; of high-fiber plants, nuts and fermented foods to feed your microbiome the nutrient buffet it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="QOOUCAO2VVDHFLZOGTLRMUBQXE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="QOOUCAO2VVDHFLZOGTLRMUBQXE"&gt;Research on probiotics is all over the map&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2LQPBGSDABDZLB5XH5S3WBMA6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Officially, the term “probiotic” is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2014.66.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; as live microorganisms known to confer a health benefit. But of the more than 1,000 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32715136/" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of probiotics, there is vast heterogeneity across experiments — different bacterial strains, different doses and different outcomes being measured. Some take characteristics of the host microbiome into account; others don’t, focusing more on symptoms or other health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A375ZN2QXVAADPC7XAT5JWLSLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This creates a confusing research landscape peppered with both positive and negative results. Even when &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.46872" target="_blank"&gt;aggregated into meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt;, the results are all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGGRBSRCHBDXVOT4VIKIGA26QY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration doesn’t consider over-the-counter probiotics to be drugs, so unlike medications,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;they don’t have to go through the process of rigorous testing and clinical trials. This issue also comes up when scientists seek to draw conclusions about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/09/antiaging-skincare-routine-retinol/" target="_blank"&gt;skin care products&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/01/vitamins-supplements-safety/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, which also aren’t regulated as drugs by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="M6LHNZMAVNDF5OER7JM7K4KHBE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="M6LHNZMAVNDF5OER7JM7K4KHBE"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The promise of the microbiome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ATPJE5Y2QFEYRB2VY7V7ZTBQXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Microbiome science as we know it took off in the early 2000s when researchers recognized how many healthy bacteria — not the kinds that cause a sudden major infection — reside inside our guts. Shortly afterward, the National Institutes of Health laid the groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2792171/" target="_blank"&gt;Human Microbiome Project&lt;/a&gt;, a major &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06244" target="_blank"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; to sequence and improve our understanding of the microbiome, from which many discoveries were made about diseases &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/09/28/parkinsons-disease-gut-brain-connection/" target="_blank"&gt;influenced by our gut bacteria.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZWDCQLW6S5HZTG6RBY35OPQO2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In theory, it would logically follow, altering the bacterial composition of the microbiome, possibly through the introduction of live microorganisms, could benefit our health. But achieving that has been easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QK7GBMMUSBFONN3AOCY64HNJ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Probiotics — or other ways to modulate the microbiome, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/06/03/what-is-a-fecal-transplant/" target="_blank"&gt;fecal transplant&lt;/a&gt; — have incredible potential, but realizing that potential is still a nascent scientific field in many ways. Each of our microbiomes, medical history and diets is unique. We still need rigorous studies that would allow us to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30193112/" target="_blank"&gt;personalize such treatments&lt;/a&gt; for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="PLQVWDRXAJCFPHJ7QYPHDRUNPQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="PLQVWDRXAJCFPHJ7QYPHDRUNPQ"&gt;Why misinformation is rampant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PKSE2KILBBGWDESCJDU7ABENO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to probiotics, commercial interests have outpaced the science. This &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(18)30415-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;uncomfortable disconnect&lt;/a&gt; has been known to gastroenterologists and microbiome scientists for many years. One common tactic by marketers is to blur data from one probiotic into the purported benefits of the one being sold — as if all probiotic types fall neatly under one big umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SUT2AJZYLVCHBCZMXENT3IDMVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Misinformation about probiotics is common on social media. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-15456-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 100 YouTube videos about probiotics found that 95 percent of the videos endorsed a positive attitude toward their consumption — with far more content produced by amateurs than by experts. And a 2021 study found that &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258098" target="_blank"&gt;discussions of probiotics on X (formerly Twitter)&lt;/a&gt; were dominated by advertisements and promotions rather than by scientists or policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="F4TJPKLYXRFPJCQ25SZCATFWHA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="F4TJPKLYXRFPJCQ25SZCATFWHA"&gt;Who should take probiotics?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7TI2HKPNVZEQXI3GUNZ4G3RB2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are a few very specific scenarios where &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(20)34729-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;clinical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; support the use of probiotics in adults.

Your own experience is valid — a fraction of people do experience a benefit. In these cases, I tell my patients I’m glad they’ve found something that has helped them and feel reassured if they’ve bought a probiotic from a company vetted by a third-party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HESIQWVE6RFIVN6YSOUD2JCUAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But more often, I see patients experiencing some symptom — perhaps bloating or belly pain — and they started taking a probiotic to see if it would help.

We quickly understood how deadly an infection could be, especially for those with underlying conditions like diabetes and heart disease. But it has taken years of research to start making sense of how a bout of Covid can lead to lasting, sometimes invisible changes in different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of these effects, such as chronic fatigue and brain fog, are considered long Covid, defined as symptoms from an infection that persist for at least three months. By some estimates, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html" title=""&gt;400 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have been diagnosed with some form of long Covid. But an infection can also lead to other issues, including lung and heart damage and microbiome changes in the gut, that may not always be recognized as long Covid but can still have a lasting effect on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;We now have a better sense of what might be behind those changes, including the role of the widespread inflammation that Covid can cause. For most people, inflammation will subside once the virus clears. But for some, if it “rages” too intensely or persists as a “slow burn” for too long, it can wreak havoc around the body, said Dr. Braden Kuo, a neurogastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what scientists have learned so far about inflammation and the other factors driving these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-tosae5 eoo0vm40" id="link-300a4cd4"&gt;The Lungs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 09:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9mV0VVUkE1dHI1UEQtRC1EMHBPUXFLb2FRc0F5Q0lMYjVnRGkxNGRSR2ZTS2xYYWRBZ1dTZXNpU0NBTEhNdE5JOTBRcVpuZ1VtOHhnTU9rZjZLZjl1V2I0bUZkaHFuVkM1bkJFc084RUx4ZEw3TVVmOHAyVGJ4eDg</guid></item><item><title>For Patients Needing Transplants, Hope Arrives on Tiny Hooves - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNME0xMTM0TVViU3JnNmdhTnZDamhuOHpEeENabnFxUTAzM0NEQ2RJc1RVam9aVTlCeURmaU9ncmpMUnMxdkVNNmdtYk5zanY1aDNpRUc0TGFCQlNTQkRWYTFiUksxQmFjZkY2ZlRVdlFSVk43S3dBb2pGdnpLaVBpZVFDUkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On a 300-acre farm in an undisclosed location in rural Wisconsin, surrounded by fields dotted with big red barns and bordered by wild blue chicory and goldenrod, live some of the most pampered pigs in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;They are delivered by C-section to protect them from viruses that sows can carry, and bottle-fed instead of nursed for the same reason.

&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Jane Wairimu (not her real name), a woman in her mid 30s developed high blood pressure and back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616524592174-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;When she sought treatment, her doctor told her one of the reasons for these conditions at that age was a lack of regular and quality sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Additionally, a lack of regular sex has also been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Wairimu abstained from sexual activity for nearly eight years. She says her husband became impotent following the birth of their third child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“People experience periods of sexual inactivity or dry spells for various reasons, including busy schedules, being single or choosing to take a break, or adhering to religious teachings that  discourage pre-marital or &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/between-the-sheets/article/2001237038/21-reasons-why-you-should-have-sex-and-the-advantages-to-our-health"&gt;extra marital affairs&lt;/a&gt;,” explains a gynaecologist and medical consultant based at Karen Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616513706683-4" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;While prolonged sexual abstinence is generally not associated with significant negative physical health effects, it can impact on emotional well being and intimacy within a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;”Anxiety, depression, and stress can arise from a lack of regular sex,”** says Dr. Joseph Odhiambo. Couples who do not engage in regular sex often feel less connected. Sex triggers the release of hormones like oxytocin and endorphins, which help manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Improved memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Oxytocin also promotes better sleep. Research suggests that frequent sexual activity is linked to improved memory, and some studies indicate that sex may help the brain grow neurons and function more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Regular sex fosters emotional closeness between partners, improving communication. Studies show that couples who have sex more frequently tend to be happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;However, experts emphasize that daily intercourse is not necessary—once a week is often sufficient, as recommended by medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;After the age of 20, individuals should have sex at least twice a month to avoid complications associated with a lack of regular intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to Dr Odhiambo, a medic at Kenyatta University Teaching, Research, and Referral Hospital, sex can also boost the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;One study among college students found that those who had sex one to &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/features/article/2001504841/gen-z-boldly-redefine-casual-sex-and-safe-contraception-amidst-the-condom-dilemma"&gt;two times per week&lt;/a&gt; had higher levels of immunoglobulin, an antibody crucial for immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“If you are a woman experiencing menopause, regular intercourse is even more important,” explains Dr Odhiambo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Without it, the vaginal tissues can become thinner, more fragile, and prone to tearing or bleeding during sex, which may lead to discomfort and avoidance—worsening the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Menopausal changes, including vaginal dryness and irritation, can be treated with lubricants, moisturizers, or low-dose estrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;It is widely believed that a lack of regular sex may contribute to prostate cancer. However, research on the topic is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;While some experts suggest that frequent ejaculation might help reduce the risk, others argue that sexual activity could expose men to sexually transmitted infections that contribute to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Pharmacist and molecular biologist Dr Steve Waluande states that men should ejaculate at least 21 times per month to reduce their risk of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Many prostate cancer patients I encounter admit to long periods without ejaculation, sometimes lasting months or even years,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is any issue that prevents an individual or couple from experiencing satisfaction during sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Studies suggest that 45 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men experience some form of sexual dysfunction, which can occur at any stage of the sexual response cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is generally classified into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Desire disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Lack of interest or reduced sexual desire. Arousal disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Difficulty becoming physically aroused. Orgasm disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Delay or inability to reach orgasm. Pain disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Discomfort or pain during intercourse. While sexual dysfunction can affect individuals of all ages, it is more prevalent in those over 40 due to age-related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Common sexual health concerns for men:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Erectile dysfunction (inability to maintain an erection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Delayed or absent ejaculation despite sufficient stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Premature ejaculation (inability to control the timing of ejaculation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;For women: Difficulty achieving orgasm. Insufficient vaginal lubrication. Vaginismus (involuntary tightening of vaginal muscles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;For both men and women: Low libido or lack of interest in sex. Difficulty with arousal. Pain during intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Dr Odhiambo explains that medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic illnesses (e.g., kidney or liver disease), alcoholism, and substance abuse can all impact sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Additionally, certain medications, including some antidepressants, may contribute to sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Social psychologist Tamara Ochieng’, formerly of Maseno University, highlights that psychological factors—such as stress, anxiety, body image concerns, past trauma, and relationship conflicts—can also play a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Furthermore, some prescription and over-the-counter medications may reduce libido or interfere with sexual performance. The risk of sexual side effects is increased when an individual is taking several medications. Some over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants can cause erectile dysfunction or problems with ejaculation, explains Dr Waluande. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The 'silent' X chromosome within female brains may not be so silent after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found evidence in both mice and humans that as we age, 'sleeping' X chromosomes can be 'awakened' in brain cells critical to learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlooked influence of this genetic library could be a key reason why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-not-just-humans-females-outlive-males-in-other-mammals-too"&gt;females live longer than males&lt;/a&gt; and exhibit slower cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In typical aging, women have a brain that looks younger, with fewer cognitive deficits compared to men," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/03/429571/silent-x-chromosome-gives-aging-female-brain-boost"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dena Dubal from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results show that the silent X in females actually reawakens late in life, probably helping to slow cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg" alt="Brain Cells Hippocampus" class="size-medium wp-image-154260" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-642x406.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-657x415.jpg 657w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-768x485.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus-600x379.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-in-hippocampus.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154260" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes (green), in the hippocampus of the mouse brain. These cells often deteriorate during aging. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X chromosome harbors about 5 percent of the human genome, and it is largely understudied in the aging brain, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; Dubal and her co-authors from UCSF, led by neurologist Margaret Gadek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female mammals possess two X chromosomes - one from each parent – but in each cell of the body, a random one of those chromosomes is silenced and the other is activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some select genes from the X chromosome, however, can escape inactivation, and evidence suggests that as we grow older, more X chromosomes are not held down by genetic 'gag orders'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the expression of both X chromosomes could potentially drive the different ways that male and female brains age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test that idea, researchers investigated brain cells in the female hippocampus, which is a brain region strongly involved in learning, memory, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team studied mice with X chromosomes from two different rodent 'strains', &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus. &lt;/i&gt;In their models, the X chromosome in &lt;i&gt;M. musculus&lt;/i&gt; is missing an important gene, called Xist, which means it cannot be silenced like usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means in some of their offspring the &lt;i&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/i&gt; X chromosome is always the one getting deactivated, so if its genetic effects show up in brain cells, then it is considered an "escapee".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png" alt="Mouse X Chromosomes" class="size-medium wp-image-154262" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-642x587.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-454x415.png 454w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-768x702.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX-600x548.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MouseGeneticX.png 952w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154262" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; XX mice with an Xist deletion were crossed with XY &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; mice. XX progeny without an Xist deletion (left) underwent random X chromosome inactivation. XX progeny with an Xist deletion (right) harbor an active X chromosome strictly from the &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; strain and an inactive X chromosome from the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using RNA sequencing, researchers looked at the nuclei of 40,000 hippocampal cells in four young and four old female mice to figure out which X chromosome is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readings that rose from the X were 91.7 percent &lt;em&gt;M. musculus&lt;/em&gt; and 8.3 percent&lt;em&gt; M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt;. Because the &lt;em&gt;M. castaneus&lt;/em&gt; X chromosome was supposed to be silenced, this suggests between 3 and 7 percent of its genes somehow escaped inactivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was true of most cell types in the mouse hippocampus, and more so in older brains. The cells most likely to express genes of the inactive X include &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; neurons, which play a critical role in memory, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-alzheimers-finding-brains-support-cells-may-be-fueling-disease"&gt;oligodendrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, which support the formation of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if these findings extend to human brains, researchers at UCSF looked through previously published data on inactive X genes that change with age in at least one or more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half of the aging-induced targets identified on the inactivated X chromosome caused human intellectual disability if mutated. This suggests that the inactivated X chromosome carries genes enriched for cognition-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these genes, called &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt;, particularly increases its expression with age in the neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes of the dentate gyrus. The &lt;em&gt;PLP1 &lt;/em&gt;gene expresses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_proteolipid_protein"&gt;a protein involved in the formation of myelin sheaths&lt;/a&gt; that surround neurons and allow them to send messages more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In parallel to mice, older women showed increased &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; expression in the parahippocampus, compared to older men," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg" alt="Female Sex Chromosomes May Explain Why Some Brains Age Slower" class="size-medium wp-image-154428" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/oligodendrocytes-mouse-brain-square.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154428" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oligodendrocytes in the mouse brain are shown in yellow. When expressed in oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus, &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; improved cognition in aging mice. (Gadek et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the expression of the &lt;em&gt;PLP1&lt;/em&gt; gene in male and female mice improved cognition in the aging brain, enhancing learning and memory in the animal models. This could be a possible target for future treatments of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study of female-specific biology is historically underrepresented in science and medicine but is essential and expanding fervently," the team &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What X activation broadly means for women's brain health – or for other systems of the body – is now a critical area of investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads8169"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-191683"&gt;twice as high&lt;/a&gt; in men as in women, and new research points to a potential reason why: a normally benign protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) protein is not normally a threat, and is important in regulating cellular energy use in the brain. However, the new research shows that in some  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="153473" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; cases, the immune system mistakes PINK1 for an enemy, attacking brain cells that express the protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, led by a team from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California, the PINK1-related damage done by the immune system's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; is much more widespread and aggressive in the brains of men than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153476" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153476" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic.jpg" alt="Parkinsons graphic" class="wp-image-153476 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/ParkinsonsGraphic-600x287.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153476" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied multiple proteins related to Parkinson's disease. (Williams et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sex-based differences in T cell responses were very, very striking," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Alessandro Sette, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. "This immune response may be a component of why we see a sex difference in Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using blood samples from Parkinson's patients, the researchers tested the response of the T cells in the blood against a variety of proteins &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10113022"&gt;previously linked&lt;/a&gt; to Parkinson's – finding that PINK1 stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the male Parkinson's patients, the research team noticed a six-fold increase in T cells targeting PINK1-tagged brain cells, compared with healthy brains. In the female Parkinson's patients, there was only a 0.7-fold increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15626-w"&gt;previously found&lt;/a&gt; something similar happening with T cells and the alpha-synuclein protein. However, these reactions weren't common to all Parkinson's brains, which prompted the hunt for more antigens – substances that trigger immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is always the case with research of this type, once experts know more about how a disease gets started and how it progresses, that opens up new opportunities for finding ways to put a halt to the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We could potentially develop therapies to block these T cells, now that we know why the cells are targeting in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/immune-cells-may-lead-to-more-parkinsons-cases-in-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Cecilia Lindestam Arlehamn, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, being able to spot these PINK1-sensitive T cells in blood samples could lead to Parkinson's disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;being diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; at an earlier stage – which again helps with treatment and patient support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're still waiting to discover a cure for Parkinson's disease, constant progress is being made in understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-link-to-gut-bacteria-suggests-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;the risk factors involved&lt;/a&gt; in its development, and new approaches &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;to tackling it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;An outbreak of tuberculosis, or TB – a lung disease that is often accompanied by a hacking cough – began in January 2024 in Kansas City, Kansas, and two nearby counties and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;continues as of early March 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, 147 people have been reportedly diagnosed with TB in the outbreak, with 67 becoming ill. The remaining 80 people diagnosed with TB in Kansas contracted the illness but showed no symptoms, which is called a latent infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB is the leading infectious cause of death around the world, outpaced only by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;COVID-19 during the first three years of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0nZ6HV5VA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conversation asked microbiologists &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEgCkh0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Karen Dobos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZdujPQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Marcela Henao-Tamayo&lt;/a&gt;, both from Colorado State University, to explain why this ancient disease seems to be making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's the history of TB?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; is the organism that causes the disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; in humans. The disease has been infecting humans for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found evidence of the disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426"&gt;9,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the excavated remains of people who lived in the Eastern Mediterranean region during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of TB date back to around 410-400 B.C.E., when the physician Hippocrates termed the disease phthisis, an archaic word that means a progressive "wasting away," due to the way &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;people with the disease become emaciated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB was also known as consumption for the same reason. Similarly, it was called the white plague or white death – due to anemia from the disease, with people appearing pallid or chalky – leading to near-certain death. Untreated active TB, meaning cases that are symptomatic, is highly lethal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wA_fObLY6GE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of all people with untreated active TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/tb-disease-burden/2-2-tb-mortality"&gt;die from the disease&lt;/a&gt;, whereas treatment &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment/2-3-tb-treatment--coverage-and-outcomes#"&gt;reduces the death rate to 12%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more colorful phrases describing TB is "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7199.1705"&gt;the king's evil&lt;/a&gt;." This is a form of TB that also causes neck swelling and lesions, a condition called scrofula. During the Middle Ages, people believed that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/AC-2803_article"&gt;touch of a king&lt;/a&gt; could cure a person from this form of TB through miraculous intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, TB was most ominously called the "robber of youth" due to its historical propensity to &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-59178487/JMVH%20Vol%2022%20No%202"&gt;afflict people 15 to 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin, an army physician in Paris, demonstrated that TB could be transmitted from infected animals to healthy ones through inoculation. Before these studies, the cause of TB was &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;presumed to be primarily constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, by either an inherent predisposition or from unhealthy or immoral lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microorganism causing TB was ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#"&gt;discovered in 1882&lt;/a&gt; by the German physician Robert Koch. Koch announced his findings on March 24, 1882, a day globally recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World TB Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does TB spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is spread by small infectious droplets in the air. A TB patient may emit these droplets by coughing, singing and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202110-2378OC"&gt;potentially from regular breathing that occurs during sleep or resting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One form of TB can be spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.091"&gt;unpasteurized dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. While rare, there have been reports of TB &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm725253-H.pdf"&gt;transmission through bone graphs&lt;/a&gt;, in which healthy, donated bone material is used to replace damaged bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the TB outbreak in Kansas remains unknown as of early March 2025. The outbreak has disproportionately affected those in low-income communities, and two people have died from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient with untreated TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;can infect 10 to 15 others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Could the COVID-19 pandemic be a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="154446" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has played a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/covid-19-and-tb?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;pivotal role in the resurgence of TB&lt;/a&gt;. Cases &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?"&gt;increased globally by 4.6% from 2020 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, reversing decades of steady declines in the disease. In the U.S. alone, TB cases rose by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/index.html"&gt;more than 15% from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During mandatory shutdowns, people were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2118145"&gt;less able to access health care centers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711"&gt;early diagnosis of TB&lt;/a&gt; or to fill prescriptions for treatment, perhaps due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 while visiting a medical care facility. COVID-19-related disruptions in care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024"&gt;resulted in nearly 700,000 excess deaths from TB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to health care may not be the only factor behind this uptick. Medical supply shortages and delays in shipment may have also played a role. For example, the U.S. experienced &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/php/dear-colleague-letters/2023-tb-drug-shortages.html"&gt;shortages of one of the primary TB drugs&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main treatments?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multidrug treatment is currently the only way to cure TB and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the late 1930s, when the first antibiotic for TB treatment was developed, TB treatments included bloodletting and consumption of cod liver oil. The most popular treatment involved isolated sanatoriums in high-altitude areas such as the Adirondacks and the Rocky Mountains, where the cold, dry air was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/4574446"&gt;believed to be a cure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars at the time suggested that the potential for cure was due to these environments being more &lt;a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1017&amp;amp;context=unm_bulletin"&gt;invigorating for the body and providing more restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There is no evidence to support these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptomycin was the first antibiotic treatment to become available for TB, in the 1940s. However, the microorganism quickly became drug resistant. A second antibiotic, called isoniazid, was developed as a first-line treatment &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-98726273/JMVH"&gt;against TB in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the microorganism became drug resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two- and four-drug combinations are now used to treat both latent infections and active disease. Treatment of active TB requires at least six months of uninterrupted therapy. Disruptions in treatment result in further spread of TB and the emergence of multidrug resistant TB, which requires additional drugs and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;nine months of treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All TB drugs are toxic; the quality of life for TB patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.22.0514"&gt;deteriorates during treatment&lt;/a&gt; and remains so throughout their lives. Finding cases and treating TB illness early, before symptoms begin, is important because it not only reduces the spread of disease but also greatly reduces drug toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should people be aware of?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should be aware that TB is still a public health problem across the globe. Education on the transmission, treatment and need for active work to eradicate TB is the best defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why education and awareness about TB are so important is that a person with latent TB may be unknowingly harboring the microorganism for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of symptoms, these people are unlikely to seek care and will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00028-6"&gt;not be diagnosed and treated&lt;/a&gt; unless identified as part of an outbreak, as was the case for more than half of the patients in Kansas.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/249450/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

It affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., with most patients either dying or requiring a lung transplant within three to five years of diagnosis. Despite its severity, the disease has no known cause or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study has the potential to be a game changer,” said Dr. Paul Noble, chair of the Department of Medicine and co-senior author of the study. “We identified a root cause of IPF-related lung damage and a potential therapeutic target that might restore the lungs’ ability to heal themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Graphical abstract on how zinc works in the lungs.

These stem cells, known as type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), play a key role in repairing &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-why-most-life-long-smokers-never-develop-lung-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung tissue&lt;/a&gt;. Without sufficient zinc, their ability to regenerate is impaired, leading to worsening fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing the molecular pathway responsible for this dysfunction, the team identified a potential method to restore lung healing. Their findings suggest that targeting this pathway could lead to treatments capable of reversing lung damage rather than just slowing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further explore this, the researchers developed a laboratory model of IPF using mice. This model allows them to test potential therapies in a controlled environment, providing a crucial step toward developing new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also studied &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-ai-platform-significantly-improves-lung-cancer-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung organoids&lt;/a&gt;—miniature, simplified versions of organs grown from patient tissues. They found that cells missing the ZIP8 protein, which helps transport zinc into the cell, failed to regenerate and form colonies as healthy cells should. This highlighted ZIP8’s essential role in lung repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The organoids with AEC2 cells that had the ZIP8 transporter were able to draw zinc into the cells, and then were able to regenerate and form more colonies,” said Carol Liang, MD, MBA, associate professor of Medicine and first author of the study. “The cells without ZIP8 didn’t have a way to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/zinc-can-improve-crop-yields-and-climate-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;draw zinc in&lt;/a&gt;, so they formed fewer colonies. This is how we determined that it is ZIP8 that allows the cells to use zinc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also used medication and deletion of the ZIP8 gene in mouse AEC2s to mimic IPF in laboratory mice. When they fed these mice a diet that included zinc supplements, their fibrosis improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been few detailed studies of how &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-reveal-significant-link-between-zinc-levels-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;zinc works in the lungs&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dianhua Jiang, MD, PhD, professor of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study. “Ours is the first to identify the detailed function of zinc in lung biology, specifically in IPF. It was particularly exciting to discover that zinc regulates the production of two other key molecules that promote tissue regeneration, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and Sirtuin1. These molecules have been implicated in tissue regeneration and aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Role of zinc dysregulation in lung disease.

Despite the best efforts of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/could-wearable-devices-adversely-affect-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt;, IPF remains a major public health concern, affecting more people each year as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings offer hope for patients and their families who have been impacted by this devastating condition. While there is still much research to be done to understand the mechanisms behind the loss of ZIP8 and how zinc supplements can help &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/e-cigarette-use-increases-risk-for-asthma-by-252-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reverse lung damage&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of this molecular pathway is a significant step forward in the fight against IPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study has the potential to provide much-needed relief for patients suffering from IPF,” said Liang. “We hope to continue our research and ultimately develop a safe and effective treatment for this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;UMAP plots of flow-enriched EpCAM+CD31–CD45– cells from healthy (11,381 cells, n = 6) and IPF lungs (14,687 cells, n = 6).

Societies around the world are "&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1487139/full" target="_blank"&gt;dismally unprepared&lt;/a&gt;" for an aging population, Foo wrote in the science journal Frontiers last month, and with his co-authors described AI and other technologies as "pivotal forces with the potential to drive a paradigm shift in healthcare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Foo, artificial intelligence is set to play a "huge" role in elderly care in Singapore, both in terms of helping clinicians manage non-acute conditions and in overseeing administrative tasks such as monitoring the availability of hospital beds, he said in an email to CNBC. "As the elderly in Singapore get more IT savvy, we see them turning to teleconsultations and digital tools that utilize AI technology," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is also being used to detect diseases earlier, an area of personal interest for Dr Han Ei Chew, a research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. He said his late mother's diabetic eye disease could have been diagnosed — and treated — earlier had AI testing methods been available when she was alive, as they are are now. "That would have been so useful when the family was going through that journey," Chew told CNBC by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big focus for Singapore is "aging in place," according to Chew. "We can deploy the AI, but it isn't about fully replacing human care ... it is really about assisting the caregivers and helping seniors to stay independent and age in place," he told CNBC via video call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chew said Singapore's Housing and Development Board is even offering built-in home technology to &lt;a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/smart-hdb-town-page/assistive-living-technologies" target="_blank"&gt;detect when someone falls&lt;/a&gt; down, with an alert sent to a resident's next of kin or connected to a call center for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These types of monitoring technology need to be used carefully, Chew said, in whatever jurisdiction they are deployed. "The AI should empower the seniors and not strip them of control. They still need to have the choice to opt in, set boundaries, and, more importantly, to turn it off when they want," he told CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A care 'co-pilot'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not only Singapore that is looking at using AI for elderly care. In the United States, Sensi.AI is a fast-growing "care co-pilot" that monitors elderly people using audio devices that are usually plugged into three areas of their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company co-founder and CEO Romi Gubes said the technology can provide caregivers with more than 100 different insights, alerting them to early signs of urinary tract or respiratory infections, or to falls or cognitive decline. "We're combining multiple indicators that are coming from audio," Gubes told CNBC by video call. "Think about, for example, respiratory infection. This will [take into account] the cadence of the coughing, the frequency, the type of coughing, together with ... complaints around fever, dizziness," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sensi.AI is installed in a home, it creates a "baseline" over two weeks, noting a range of "acoustic indicators," Gubes said, including non-verbal sounds like objects being moved, footsteps or snores, which it combines with its team's clinical knowledge. Once the AI knows the baseline sounds in a home, it can alert caregivers to any audio anomalies that might suggest a health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gubes said Sensi is being used by "tens of thousands" of seniors in the U.S. and a spokesperson said the company is in discussions about a potential expansion in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ageism in AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts CNBC spoke to warned that AI must be used carefully when it comes to senior health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foo warned that the over-use of AI in consultations might lead to "poorer health outcomes" as not all elderly people can use technology, and he warned that it must be correctly designed to avoid "perpetuating digital ageism." Indeed, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/09-02-2022-ensuring-artificial-intelligence-(ai)-technologies-for-health-benefit-older-people" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt;, "The implicit and explicit biases of society, including around age, are often replicated in AI technologies," and its 2022 &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/351503/9789240040793-eng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;policy brief&lt;/a&gt; urged developers to have older people participate in the design of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Singapore, the government's "&lt;a href="https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/3/b1fd5713-8ff9-46d5-9911-0f233f2a8b31/refreshed-action-plan-for-successful-ageing-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Action Plan for Successful Ageing&lt;/a&gt;" details its aims, such as to reach 550,000 seniors with a health and wellness program and reduce hospital deaths from 61% to 51% between 2023 and 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Foo said seniors' opinions needed to be taken into account when determining how AI can address their health needs. "Like all new initiatives, failure will be inevitable if the target audience, i.e. the elderly, are not on board. We [need] to hear their voices and tailor the national health-AI strategy to suit their needs while not removing the human element of healthcare. That is the challenge," he told CNBC by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chew, the approach to elderly care will need to blend human and machine, describing it as "high tech, but high touch." "The AI is probably best used as an extra set of eyes, ears and the robots [are an] extra set of hands, but not as a replacement for the high touch human care giving," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 23:06:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPLU96TlJCQjJQdXgzYW4yZGVPSnhpWlRLaGxDQTgyQ0NHV0p3OWZFU2VaRDE2aHZQa01rcTVKWndmZVdnaXFYX1NxZFBRZ05oazVjbmFUNVBoOHY1QWRWSVdJNHY5a1VQZ2trX3kzVlZQNTJYcTNXdWlTTHZ2X3pnNHRzajhDRWFWVjdjdG5qQXRrMVNObmFPakJ1Q2JkdHd2Rkg5bTNLT1XSAa4BQVVfeXFMTlU0QXFIamE1RkFGUWlPd2xLbDh6czFwNVJnNVJydXNTVXZ4MXpsdUotOUoycllDZ01rZlNRZnpVb29MN1hMU3JvMktpTXhvTU1qY0RYU2E4dWNrRGFJaUduYmFRSG1FUnJJaGpMWDJlakJpdGQ1bUhMbjNTb1FtMW9BbHRwcUdLT0YtSS1VV3NNWExOUDV4blNnZmhucUdQbUVQN290M25uQXd1T3BB</guid></item><item><title>This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQb3BxOG16SlRqSUp3SHNrNlFDakZReHg0NjluYnR2MTJfZXRORmhVLU9mTXhFOTJZMGduZlhCaHFoOUlOa0RWQWlKVnF6Zkpuem81M1lhYlZyVUdmUEFLY0hVd0VxbjJmaUtxaXQ5TXJRb0NBR21vNGpUaWUxU3JrSGNnbEVUc1dPNGJQcy1tY2ZZYUdRWF9vTTk4V1ZkaEdhYXQ5V2ZCaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C_elegans_cell_and_nucleus_sizes.svg"&gt;J.J.Froehlich/CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that gene activity associated with caloric restriction could be seen in the kidney and liver tissues of mice treated with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, some of the changes that caloric restriction gives in animals and thought to confer certain health benefits also appear with a hypertension drug that many people already take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another discovery was that a biological signaling receptor called nish-1 was crucial in the effectiveness of rilmenidine. This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEwj7ICt3Y/"&gt;Prostock-studio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes rilmenidine a promising candidate as an anti-aging drug is that it can be taken orally, it's already widely prescribed, and its side effects are rare and relatively mild (they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go yet in figuring out if rilmenidine would work as an anti-aging drug for actual humans, but the early signs in these worm and mice tests are promising. We now know much more about what rilmenidine can do, and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging, even if slightly, are immense," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2023.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A component found in all fungi may provide a shield that prevents flu-related lung damage, according to a new Canadian study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preclinical trial uncovered how beta-glucan—which is found in all mushrooms, and also yeast, oats, and barley—can ‘reprogram’ immune cells to prevent lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, demonstrated that administering the compound to mice before their exposure to influenza, reduced lung damage, improve lung function and lowered the risk of illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists led by Professor Maziar Divangahi discovered that a unique structure of this component can boost defenses against pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most research focuses on stopping the virus from replicating, this study explored how to regulate the body’s immunity to infection, a concept known as “disease tolerance.” The researchers discovered that beta-glucan significantly enhanced flu survival rates by modulating immune responses and preventing severe lung inflammation, a common cause of fatality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-024-02041-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in Nature Immunology&lt;/a&gt;, highlight beta-glucan as a promising therapy for influenza, as well as other emerging viral pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable how beta-glucan can reprogram certain immune cells, such as neutrophils, to control excessive inflammation in the lung,” &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/new-discovery-could-help-protect-against-influenza-363625" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said first author&lt;/a&gt; Nargis Khan, who conducted this research at McGill and is now an Assistant Professor at the University of Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neutrophils are traditionally known for causing inflammation, but beta-glucan has the ability to shift their role to reduce it,” added co-first author Kim Tran, who recently completed her Ph.D. at McGill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK OUT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="The Medicinal Value of Chaga Mushrooms as a Nutraceutical for Good Health" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-medicinal-value-of-chaga-mushrooms-as-a-nutraceutical-for-good-health/" rel="bookmark"&gt;The Medicinal Value of Chaga Mushrooms as a Nutraceutical for Good Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rebalancing the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most flu-related deaths aren’t caused by the virus itself, but by an overreaction of the immune system, said the researchers. This suggests the true danger lies in the host’s own immune response. However, how the immune system becomes so imbalanced remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beta-glucan is found in the cell walls of all fungi, including some that live in and on our bodies as part of the human microbiome,” explained Divangahi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is tempting to hypothesize that the levels and composition of fungi in an individual could influence how their immune system responds to infections, in part because of beta-glucan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With flu season underway and the looming threat of bird flu (H5N1), developing effective therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases is more critical than ever, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

Some families &lt;a href="https://www.upworthy.com/tag/recipes" target="_blank"&gt;have recipes&lt;/a&gt; they are sworn never to share with outsiders. Other folks have tricks they use at work that give them a competitive advantage that could be used against them if they let it out of the bag. Other people use secret techniques &lt;a href="https://www.upworthy.com/the-3-step-harvard-conversation-trick-that-makes-shy-people-more-likable-ex1" target="_blank"&gt;to be likable&lt;/a&gt; but fear being seen as manipulative if they share them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own “secret sauce” that makes them unique. A couple of hundred of them were very kind and shared those secret life hacks on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hvqz4d/whats_a_life_hack_so_good_you_almost_dont_want_to/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a recent social media post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where someone asked, “What’s a life hack so good you almost don’t want to share it?” They received over 3500 responses, and we culled the best from them to make our readers’ lives easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice covers everything from how to win an argument to finding precious metals at your local second-hand store. The life hacks that are “so good” also include ways to prevent potentially aggravating people from getting in your face and the power of learning how to smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 17 life hacks that are “so good” that people almost didn’t want to share them. (Thankfully, they did.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. That's where it goes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If you look for something and it's not in the first place you look, THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE IT GOES. So when you find it, put it in the first place you looked for it."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. How to argue (from a lawyer)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When arguing about something, ask what their interests ('why' they want/don’t want something) are rather than their position. Usually, it’s easier to come to an agreement if you approach a conflict from this angle. Also, conceding a minor point during the argument 'you’re right about x' and 'I don’t disagree with y' tends to lessen the guard of your opposition and thus making it easier to get what you want out of them."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I just saw something similar to this. If you and another person are arguing over who gets a lemon, you’ll eventually agree to just cut it in half. But if you ask why they want the lemon, you’ll find out one person wants to juice it and one person wants the skin for zest for a recipe, so each party can have 100% of what they want if they just take the time to see the 'why' of the other person."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Whenever arguing with someone and it's going round and round trying to come up with a compromise, ask 'what does a solution look like to you?' Half the time they got no clue the other half is something you willing to compromise. It has cut down every single argument in my relationship."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. How to stop a 'Karen' in their tracks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I work as a receptionist, and my supervisor always asks me how our guests like me even if they are rude to other staff. My trick is when someone is checking in that looks like a typical Karen I always give them a compliment like 'where did you get your nails done? They are so pretty!' It usually works."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I used be in maintenance for a huge school district. Whenever I was sent to a school where the office staff had a reputation for being cranky complainy crabby pants, I had a whole song and dance I'd run through when I got there. I'd walk into the office with a big smile, acting like the nicest person in the world, just a big dumb puppy who has no idea this is a "crabby admin" school. Then, when the timing is right, I'd let slip the casual comment of 'I really like coming to this school, everyone is so nice!' It's like a magic spell. The grumpuses always tried to live up to my unrealistic view of them, and were always at least reasonable, if not downright pleasant. It always felt like cheating, but really all I was doing was setting an example they wanted to follow."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Buy the same socks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Find a pair of socks you really like. Buy like.... 40 pairs. Throw out your other socks. No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;w you can just grab any two socks and have a pair. Get a hole in one? Throw it out. You still have tons of others of the same."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. The 3 hobbies rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I was thinking about what I need to be happy, and came to the conclusion that I need 3 hobbies: one creative, one physical, and one social. For social, I do board game nights weekly. This ensures I have something planned for the week to look forward to. For physical, I go to the gym, which, to be honest, I hate and have always hated, so I took up bouldering too. This is a great hobby because it can also be very social, and it's also just fun. And for creative, I dabble in things like drawing, knitting, and other needlework. I also throw in reading here too, because it can make you think and imagine. If you play D&amp;amp;D, this can also combine with social. I've been extremely happy since figuring out for myself. I've always had a list of hobbies I want to try, but this helps me organize them."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Learn how to smile&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A genuine looking— and I say looking because it doesn’t need to actually be genuine, smile. It will disarm people making them more comfortable around you, you’ll be more likely to get dates, you’ll be more likely to get jobs, you’ll be more likely to make friends, your dating profile will look better, your wedding pics will look better, hell your social media will look better. Learn how to smile. Look it up on YouTube."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. The bathroom test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Being in the restaurant business for over 20 years now, if you go into a restaurant and their bathrooms are dirty, then get out of there. It means most likely, of course, not always, that their kitchen is just as dirty. If the general manager doesn’t care about what the guests can see, he’s definitely not caring about what the guest can’t see and that gets you such a higher chance of food poisoning."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Wake up a little earlier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Getting up consistently to start your day at a reasonable hour - regardless of intent to go anywhere or do anything - really does give you extra time in the week to get sh*t done."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. How to make someone like you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"To get someone to like you, ask them two questions, then after the second one, validate their response. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repeat. That's it. It's alarmingly effective. Just ask them any question about something they seem like they might want to talk about. hobbies or job or whatever. if you dont know anything about them, ask about the best place they've traveled, or would like to go if they haven't traveled. then, whatever they say, just ask a follow-up question about it. Then whatever they say to that, just say something positive that supports their opinion. it can be as simple as  'that seems really cool' or something more specific that shows you've been listening and agree/support them."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Visualize your life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Ask yourself what your ideal happy life would look like, and then isolate each aspect as an objective to work towards, always breaking down larger goals into smaller doable steps. Makes things seem less daunting and gives you feasable objectives to work towards."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. Know the goal of the conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Before entering any difficult conversation, conflict, apology, request, etc, you should know what your goal of the conversation for yourself is. What do you want the outcome to be? How do you want this interaction to end? How do you want both parties to be left feeling? Know this first, then practice running both sides in your head a few times. Crucially, this prepares you direct the conversation for the outcome you want, instead of just saying what you really want say. Know your goal, and you’re way more likely to reach it."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;12. Thrift store jewelry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Second-hand shops—check the jewelry because, funnily enough, the volunteers working there probably don't know much about gold. I make a fair good chunk of cash a year going through jewelry at thrift stores."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;13. Bake bacon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Piece of parchment paper over any type of pan. Bam, no mess. People boiling it in skillets on the stove are living in the stone age."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;14. How to talk to new people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When the conversation starts to die or needs a pick me up, ask what the people around you did that day. It sounds really simple, but not a lot of people get asked this question regularly, so it’s likely you’ll get a genuine answer and make the person feel like you’re interested and invested. This is my hack for work events, family you haven’t seen in ages, or a friend of a friend you just met and your mutual friend just left you two alone. I think it’s safe to assume it would be a good icebreaker on a first date as well."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;15. Self-control through pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The only thing in control of your mind and body is you. Go stand out in the rain and fight the instinct to flee inside. Find your zen. Overcome your base instincts and then figure out how to apply them to the rest of your life. Hunger, anxiety, self-esteem issues, etc, all things to overcome, master, and control."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;16. Easy investment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Invest (a portion of ) every paycheck into an S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund. It’s easy, the fees are incredibly low (nobody seems to understand mutual funds that are not index charge a fee! and if you do it consistently you will end up with money. Proven through depressions, recessions, and large-scale wars. That is all."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;17. Know their name&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When a customer service person (finally) answers the phone and says 'my name is [NAME], [something something] how can I help you?' I make a note of their name and say, "Hi [NAME], how's it going/how are you doing?" in a friendly, conversational tone before introducing myself &amp;amp; my issue. Customer service is a soulless job and involves dealing with a lot of belligerent people, so setting the tone and establishing a rapport by mentioning their names makes it a little more personal and tends to lead to better outcomes. Can probably expand this to all interactions, tbh."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in January. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Upworthy</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 21:17:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1PUWRDUzRQbnUzTmNqZG8yMFdYNGFhZmcyVXVUXzFUVVZyWHZudHl0cXlyZ2loeTkta29hOWhOQ2lUeWFUT0ppVnkzZDVWT2pjQmI1b3lMZkRtNWdsUjZFTjFBRHFuSXNWbU5HekhJQmRMaGhWSzBnSHB3N3FsQQ</guid></item><item><title>The #1 Protein to Reduce Visceral Fat, Recommended by Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE55SGl2dU0tNHlPMUMwLWtMTy1FdVphVE5FOXd6TmVlcW0wOGFjQ2ZBWHVKdTd1MWJoZUJ3SmhweEY5QmpUM1pTaFhCcmJmZHdhYURvRHRDdWtzT24xRk12MU9KZW96STRTelNOMjdXaWdORFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Visceral fat is one of those health terms you might have heard but not fully understood. It refers to the fat stored deep within your abdominal cavity, surrounding essential organs like the liver, pancreas and intestines. And when it comes to visceral fat, it’s not about appearance; reducing it is truly about protecting your well-being. That’s where your diet comes into play. Some foods may make a huge difference when it comes to managing visceral fat and supporting overall health. Among the many nutritional powerhouses out there, one protein-rich food stands out for its unique benefits—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pistachios&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike the fat just beneath your skin, visceral fat isn’t visible, making it tricky to detect. And not because you can’t see it means it doesn’t affect you. In fact, this type of fat can significantly impact your health. Excess visceral fat has been linked to a higher risk of several serious health conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and even certain types of cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data supports the notion that eating pistachios might be linked to reduced visceral fat. One study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; showed that when people with at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome snacked on tree nuts (like pistachios) instead of typical carbohydrate-heavy snacks (like chips or cookies) for 16 weeks, improvements in measures of visceral fat were observed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what makes them one of the best choices for reducing visceral fat?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Let’s be clear—no single food will reduce visceral fat, especially if you are not making appropriate overall dietary and lifestyle changes that support this outcome. But if you are taking steps to minimize this dangerous type of abdominal fat, including pistachios in the mix may help you see the results you want to see. Here are four reasons why dietitians recommend pistachios as a top pick for a visceral fat-reducing diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Pistachios are one of the best foods for reducing visceral fat, partly thanks to their rich content of healthy fats. “Pistachios are a good source of healthy fat, namely unsaturated fatty acids, which are considered cardioprotective. Saturated fats, on the other hand, are implicated in increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems and potentially additional visceral fat buildup,” shares &lt;a href="https://www.amandagodmannutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda Godman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in pistachios play a crucial role in combating unhealthy fat accumulation. Monounsaturated fats, for instance, help improve lipid profiles by lowering LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol while increasing HDL (known as “good”) cholesterol levels. This enhances overall cardiovascular health, which is closely linked to maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing abdominal fat. Additionally, these fats help regulate insulin sensitivity, a key factor in preventing visceral fat storage, as unchecked insulin resistance can lead to fat buildup around the abdomen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Data shows that consuming monounsaturated fat instead of saturated fat is linked to not only a reduction in body fat but also a difference in where fat is stored. In a 2022 study, when people ate a diet rich in saturated fat, most of the fat they gained was deposited in the abdomen as visceral fat. Those who followed a monounsaturated fat-rich diet lost weight and did not accumulate fat as visceral fat in the same way.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed With Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A single ounce of pistachios provides roughly 6 grams of protein, making them one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-8423784" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich nuts&lt;/a&gt;. Protein plays a role in fat loss as it boosts energy expenditure through the thermic effect of food (TEF), meaning your body burns more calories digesting and metabolizing protein than fats or carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, consuming high-protein foods like pistachios helps preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss, ensuring that the body prioritizes burning visceral fat rather than muscle tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Gerontology&lt;/em&gt; showed that, among older men, consuming more protein may be linked to decreased visceral abdominal fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Abundant in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Antioxidants play a role in combating oxidative stress and inflammation, which are both linked to visceral fat accumulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Among the powerful antioxidants in pistachios are lutein, beta-carotene and polyphenols. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing cellular damage and promoting overall metabolic health. Studies have shown that diets rich in antioxidants can support better fat metabolism and improve insulin sensitivity, both of which are essential for minimizing visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research&lt;/em&gt; suggest the possible benefit of an antioxidant diet in relieving visceral obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low In Calories &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Pistachios can support fat loss and metabolic health due to their lower calorie density (160 calories per ounce versus 180–200 in other nuts),” shares &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, an Orlando-based registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This balance of high-protein and low-calorie density makes pistachios an ideal choice for those seeking to reduce visceral fat while enjoying a tasty and convenient snack.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One serving of pistachios equals about 49 kernels, making it one of the most generous serving sizes for nuts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The low-calorie nature of pistachios, combined with their high fiber and protein content, helps regulate hunger and reduce the likelihood of eating too much throughout the day.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reducing visceral fat is essential to improve your long-term health and lower your risk of severe chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. While no single food can guarantee fat loss, pistachios can help support your efforts when combined with other healthy lifestyle practices such as regular exercise, stress management and adequate sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether enjoyed as a standalone snack or incorporated into meals, pistachios’ versatility and nutritional profile—rich in healthy fats, protein and antioxidants and low in calories—make them a valuable asset in lowering visceral fat. Remember, the key to success lies in overall balance and dedication to making informed, proactive choices about your well-being.&lt;br&gt;

It involves replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one to improve vision. One in three people over 65 have cataracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;More than half of NHS cataract procedures in England are outsourced to private providers as part of a collaboration between the NHS and the ­private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.4"&gt;&lt;div id="acf5bfcf-91df-4d16-b79d-ddfb9596d7ee"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Cataract surgery is the most common operation in the NHS, with more than 400,000 people having procedures each year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GOC/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Optegra, which runs 17 NHS hospitals and clinics, conducted 50,000 NHS cataract operations last year. Alastair Stuart, the Optegra medical director and a consultant ophthalmic surgeon, said: “Normally after a cataract removal procedure, patients leave with a rather intense drop regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“They have four different types of drops which they need to take three or four times a day, for up to four weeks. This is quite a commitment and hassle for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Due to medical advances we are now able to apply a steroid injection as part of the surgical procedure, which eliminates the need for any drops whatsoever. This is revolutionary for patients’ post-operative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“On top of this, we provide treatment for both eyes on the same day. While we do this regularly for private patients, the normal pathway for NHS patients is to have one eye treated and then return several weeks later for the second eye.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nhs-waiting-list-pilot-ai-patient-risk-score-mw2v0pc76" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;App spots patients at risk and moves them up the NHS waiting list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Stuart explained that the imbalance between the eyes in the weeks between surgeries can “be quite uncomfortable and make people feel unsteady”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “By treating both eyes on one day the patient leaves with excellent vision in both eyes, which immediately decreases the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“By completing the pre-operative ­diagnostic tests and consultation on the day of treatment, patients have been delighted to reduce the number of visits to the hospital, especially if they have a distance to travel and are relying on friends or family to be available — also as the patient cannot drive themselves home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While each of these elements have been successfully carried out before, this is the first time all three have been offered to patients at once. Five patients were treated at the Hampshire clinic last week as part of the trial, with hundreds more due to participate this month. Drop-free surgery will also be rolled out to all NHS patients at ­Optegra clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Those benefiting include Jim Hayles, 70, from Southampton, who said: “Two eyes at the same time means I do not have to worry about having two ops and two lots of everything, so yes, that’s great. I’ve also been told that normally you would have drops for four weeks, at different times of day, so you have to remember to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This procedure means you don’t have to have drops at all, which is going to be brilliant because I can just walk out of here and within a day or two, take the covers off and that’s it. I don’t have to worry about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Maria Walmsey, 78, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, has struggled with reading and cooking because of her ­cataracts. She said: “It’s got progressively worse and impacts on everyday life, in everything you are doing — whether hobbies or just in general. My &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/health-jvqwk3rgd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt; became blurry and it’s there all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The thought of coming in one day and having everything done in both eyes is obviously beneficial.

After following the same 100 women for a decade, she found that there were crucial differences between bisexuality and the sexual fluidity that otherwise heterosexual women experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/heartbreak/sad-but-common-signs-your-marriage-already-over"&gt;12 Sad But Common Signs Your Marriage Is Already Over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/experts/dr-lori-bisbey/am-i-bisexual-what-being-bisexual-really-means-to-me-at-least"&gt;Bisexuality is defined as&lt;/a&gt; being attracted to men and women. Many women, Diamond found, identified as gay or straight, but accepted the fact that they might change their minds at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When experts say that women are more likely to be fluid, they mean that they’re more likely to make an exception to, or even update, their identities. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does not mean that women are more likely than men to cheat on their spouses and fluidity is seldom the main cause of a relationship souring. As with any relationship problem, there are usually other, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-someone-problem-relationship-even-though-they-pretend-not-to-be"&gt;deeper relationship issues&lt;/a&gt; at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, more than ever, married women are stepping away from problem heterosexual marriages, and into same-sex ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen a mild increase in my practice of women in their 30s over the last decade,” &lt;a href="https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Kingsberg-Sheryl-1861418675" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheryl Kingsberg&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and division chief of behavioral medicine in the OB/GYN unit at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center told In Style. “Maybe it’s hormonal, maybe it’s neuroendocrine — an epigenetic shift in brain chemistry that is hormone-based. But it’s certainly a shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hormonal explanation may be that women’s testosterone levels increase with age, and higher testosterone levels &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3138231/#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20a%20high%20concentration%20of%20testosterone,to%20a%20female%2Dtypical%20orientation%20(attraction%20to%20men)." rel="nofollow"&gt;have also been linked&lt;/a&gt; with an increased incidence of homosexuality and bisexuality in women. &lt;a href="https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/87097/13/Kanazawa_Possible_evolutionary_origins_of_human_female_sexual_fluidity_AAM.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to psychological theories,&lt;/a&gt; this might help explain why women may be more fluid in their thirties and forties, after having kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/2024377641/when-shes-about-cheat-she-does-these-things"&gt;The 4 Silent 'Tells' A Woman Is About To Cheat And Blow Up Her Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evolutionary psychologists have offered several theories as to why women may be more fluid as well, such as an adaptive way to decrease conflict in polygamous cultures.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825779/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Another popular explanation&lt;/a&gt; is that, because saying yes to intimacy comes at a higher risk and reproductive cost to women, they tend to make decisions more cautiously on a case-by-case basis, which could potentially allow for more deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, likely, increased rates of fluidity among women are primarily a social (rather than biological) phenomenon. Indeed, there is emerging evidence that men have the same potential as women to be fluid, but that stigma prevents them from acting upon it. In most Western societies, women still face fewer social costs for same-sex relationships than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if one gender is more fluid than the other,” clinical social worker Alisha Powell Powell explained. “But I think that one is much more widely accepted than the other.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer-mobile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/heartbreak/bizarre-way-discovered-wife-having-affair-inside-home"&gt;The Bizarre Way I Discovered My Wife Was Having An Affair Inside Our Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lauren Vinopal is a freelance journalist who writes about health and science.

&lt;p&gt;A Howard County resident tested positive for measles after returning from international travel, according to the Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials say the measles case is not associated with the measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the following locations during the following hours may have been exposed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington Dulles International Airport: The international arrivals area&lt;br&gt;March 5th: 4 p.m. - 9 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department&lt;br&gt;March 7th: 3:30 p.m. - 7:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health, the Maryland Department of Health and Howard County health officials are looking to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who may have been exposed should contact their healthcare provider for additional guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also call Howard County Health Department’s Infectious Disease Surveillance and Response Program at 410-313-6284 or the Virginia Department Health at (804) 363-2704 or email epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you have your plump, firm, unwilted, and vibrant asparagus washed and ready to go, let’s study up on some of the most common stalk mistakes so you can steer clear of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the chefs we spoke with, try to avoid the following common faux pas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting it get parched.&lt;/strong&gt; For maximum flavor and the best texture, it’s ideal to cook your asparagus as soon as possible after you pick it from the garden or the supermarket. If you plan to cook it later, don’t &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-store-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt; it dry. Instead, keep it like you would with flowers. Trim the ends and place the asparagus, spears up, in a jar that has about half an inch of water. Cover loosely with a plastic bag, and change the water daily. Alternatively, wrap the trimmed ends in a damp paper towel, tuck the asparagus in a plastic bag, and store them in your refrigerator’s &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/what-is-a-crisper-drawer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;crisper drawer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipping the trim.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common mistake home cooks make related to asparagus is forgetting to trim the stems, says Chef Mary Payne Moran of Los Angeles. The stem can be extremely tough, woody, and not very tasty, adds cookbook author Yumna Jawad of Grand Rapids. Plan on cutting off about 1 to 2 inches from the bottom of the spears or at the point where stalks change from green to pale green or white. If the stalks are extremely thick at the ends, consider using a vegetable peeler to shave off the outermost layer or two, says Chef Adam Fiscus of New York City. Save any trimmed pieces for &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-vegetable-stock-out-of-kitchen-scraps/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;vegetable stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking low and slow.&lt;/strong&gt; Asparagus can handle the heat, Jawad confirms. Don’t be afraid to crank things up to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) when roasting or grilling, or even 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) if you like charred edges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepping it wet.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re cooking asparagus in any other way besides steaming or blanching, it's crucial to dry the asparagus well after washing. “If it has too much moisture on it, it will likely steam instead of cooking as you intended, so make sure to pat it dry well to get the best texture,” Jawad explains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You have quite a few choices when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/1079/fruits-and-vegetables/vegetables/asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cooking asparagus&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be challenging to choose. Should you &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/49439/the-best-steamed-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;steam in the microwave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/266394/air-fryer-asparagus-fries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;air-fry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223427/parmesan-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214931/oven-roasted-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;roast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18318/pan-fried-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;pan-fry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220715/deep-fried-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;deep-fry&lt;/a&gt;, or try another technique?

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If they were forced to choose just one way to ensure asparagus doesn't become soggy, the chefs recommend &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/how-to-make-best-roasted-asparagus-8621524" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;roasting&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though asparagus is a vegetable, it contains some natural sugars, which caramelize when roasted, Jawad notes. This lends nuttiness and slightly sweeter flavor, plus each stalk can cook evenly—and with very little fuss. If you allow enough space between the stalks, “there is no watery residue, and the bite is crunchy with a hint of chew,” Moran explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Roasting deepens the flavor so the tips get a bit crispy, plus it’s also easy,” says cookbook author Peter Som of New York City.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then evenly space out the stalks in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Moran suggests avoiding pans that are very dark in color, as this can lead to uneven cooking. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes, or until slightly golden brown and the thickest part of the asparagus is fork-tender.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grilling, blanching, and steaming in the microwave all deserve honorable mentions and will certainly satisfy depending on your goals and personal preferences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Grilling &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For results similar to roasting but achievable al fresco, Fiscus is fond of grilling. “Asparagus cooked this way looks great and tastes amazing, adding elegance to any plated protein dish,” he explains. It’s also versatile. As a tip, Fiscus likes to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19620/easy-and-tasty-all-purpose-marinade/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;marinate&lt;/a&gt; his vegetables for 30 minutes to a few hours to infuse each bite with extra flavor. Still, grilling didn’t get quite as many upvotes because it requires more gear and optimal weather…or a really warm coat and some thick skin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat your grill to high, or around 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil or vinaigrette per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then add the asparagus in a single layer on the grill grates. Cook, turning often with tongs, until lightly charred and fork-tender (about 3 to 5 minutes).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might be a bit ho-hum to enjoy on its own as a side dish. However, if you plan to put your cooked asparagus to use in salads or crudité platters, blanching is a brilliant option, Som says. “You’ll get the bright green color with that tender crisp texture,” he explains, which pairs perfectly with a &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8391899/apple-cider-vinaigrette/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bright vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/286167/instant-pot-jammy-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;jammy egg&lt;/a&gt;, or your favorite &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/most-saved-dip-recipe-8775965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dip recipe&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To blanch asparagus, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add washed and trimmed asparagus stalks to the water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, erring on the longer side for thicker asparagus. Once the color appears even more vibrant, use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the blanched asparagus to a bowl of ice water. Chill for 2 minutes, then remove, pat dry, and enjoy as desired.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Director of Culinary Matt Larkin of New York City admits, “My secret asparagus tip is to microwave it.” True, it might sound like a humble shortcut, but steaming gives the spears a crisp-tender quality similar to blanching—but without waiting for a pot of water to boil and preparing an ice bath. It leaps and bounds above boiling, according to Moran, since you don’t end up with the wet residue that tends to occur post-boil. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wash and trim the asparagus, then place it in a single layer on a plate. Cover the stalks with a damp paper towel, then microwave for about 3 minutes, or until the center is tender when you pierce it with a knife.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all these methods, you're now equipped for a season full of delicious asparagus.&lt;br&gt;

Usually, one to four days after the early symptoms, a red rash appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles symptoms typically develop 10-14 days after exposure to the virus but can develop as soon as seven days and as long as 21 days after exposure.

"It was a dark moment. I have lost many friends from different types of cancers, and so my first thought was, 'I'm done.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinley had 15 inches of her colon removed. She then met with Dr. Mark Lewis, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Health, and told him she was concerned about the side effects of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, she was eligible for another type of treatment: immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of patients, understandably, when you tell them they require chemotherapy, will refuse it, so it is incredibly appealing to patients that we now have another option to treat cancer, and that's immunotherapy," Lewis said. "The entire point is to turn on the immune system and allow the patient's own body to destroy the cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is a candidate for immunotherapy, and Lewis noted with this kind of treatment, there is a risk of developing an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not going to pretend that these treatments have absolutely no side effects, but for the most part, these treatments are far more tolerable than chemotherapy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinley went in for an IV every three weeks for two years. She experienced nausea at first but said she had no other side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was very successful, and I'm in remission," she said. "I feel great. I feel really good. Strong and healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cancer journey hasn't been easy, but she has remained positive, focusing on her family and her religion. She's now encouraging others to make their health a priority, especially since she didn't experience any signs or symptoms before being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Eva Brinley rings a bell signifying she has finished her cancer treatment. (Photo: Eva Brinley)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just can't stress enough how important it is to do those checkups," she said. "Stay healthy. Eat right. Have your checkups, and be aware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer. While some people may not have any symptoms, like Eva, warning signs of colon cancer may include persistent or progressive abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, such as constipation or diarrhea, blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend people at average risk of colon cancer begin screening at age 45.

    &lt;p&gt;There have never been more supplements on the supermarket shelves, or in our kitchen cupboards, as millions of us strive for better health and hope to achieve it through consuming a pill or powder. Around two-thirds of adults in the UK &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/supplements-worth-taking1/"&gt;take some form of supplement&lt;/a&gt; – that’s the equivalent of 81 million supplements a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made by isolating nutrients from plants and animals, whether we’re looking for improved immunity, increased energy or better sleep, it’s easy to treat supplements as medicines. But they’re not, and they’re not regulated like medicines either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, food supplements are regulated under the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, which align with EU and UK food laws. They must comply with general food safety legislation and cannot make misleading health claims. But, unlike medicines, supplements are not as strictly regulated and do not undergo the same rigorous testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while most supplements should be safe, whether or not they do what they say on the tin is another question. The fact that what’s available online might be from abroad and outside UK and EU rules, alongside the statistic that four in five consumers never check the ingredients label anyway, and you might be wondering just how to tell if that pricey supplement you picked up is going to do you any good at all…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first – are pricey supplements the answer? The marketing of some luxury supplements – think Lyma, where a 30-day supply of their signature supplement aimed at improving sleep, lowering stress and increasing skin and hair health costs £199 – suggests more money spent means a more effective supplement. But prices for what seem to be the same product can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/magnesium-health-benefits-body-supplements-immunity/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; as an example. At Holland &amp;amp; Barrett, a bottle of 30 tablets containing 375mg per tablet costs £3.99, or 13p per tablet. If you choose Inessa Magnesium, you’ll get 60 capsules containing 153mg per capsule for £24.99 – working out at around 42p per tablet, for less than half the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pills both contain slightly different combinations of types and sources of magnesium, so it depends on what you’re looking for, and while sometimes, price point does indicate a better product, this is not always the case, insist the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marketing plays a massive role in supplement pricing,” says Nichola Ludlam-Raine a registered specialist dietitian. “This can create a perception that they are far superior to cheaper alternatives, even if the core ingredients are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many cases, high street own-brand supplements can be just as effective as premium supplement brands. The key factors to consider are the ingredients, dosages, and third-party testing rather than branding alone. I often suggest my patients choose supermarket own brand supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are you paying for when you buy more expensive supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you buy premium supplements, you’re often paying for branding and marketing. “Luxury supplement brands invest heavily in high-end packaging, influencer partnerships, and advertising.” These, of course, make no difference to how good the product is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other reasons too. “Some premium brands use patented or trademarked versions of vitamins and minerals,” explains Ludlam-Raine, which may have enhanced bioavailability (better absorption) or research backing, and are therefore worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High-end brands may combine multiple beneficial ingredients into one formula, such as added adaptogens, nootropics, or probiotics, which could be worth paying extra for, if you want them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains: “Some premium brands undergo more rigorous third-party testing to ensure purity, potency, and absence of contaminants.” But as with any supplement, you must check if this is the case – don’t assume that the price point means these tests have been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a high-street supplement has the same form and dosage of an active ingredient as a luxury brand, it can be just as effective,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Ultimately, it’s important to read labels, check dosages, and choose reputable brands rather than relying solely on price as an indicator of quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The NHS recommends most people should get their nutrients from food, but some groups may need supplements, including those where a health care professional has said that there is a deficiency – which can be determined via a blood test,’”explains Ludlam-Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludlam-Raine recommends following the NHS advice on vitamin D, folic acid, calcium, vitamin B12, iodine, iron, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/cheap-vital-why-omega-3-helps-you-live-longer/"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone should &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency-signs-symptoms/"&gt;supplement with vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; daily during the winter months (taking 10mcg/400IU from October to March), or all year round if you are: pregnant or breastfeeding, over 65, have darker skin or spend very little time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Folic acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are pregnant, have diabetes, a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/bmi-calculator/"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt; over 30, or take certain epilepsy medications, you should supplement with folic acid. Take 5mg daily at least three months before pregnancy and for the first 12 weeks to prevent neural tube defects, or take 5mg daily if you belong to any of the other groups mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Vitamin B12, calcium, iron, iodine, and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegans and those who avoid animal products may want to consider taking a supplement that provides these nutrients, which are not available from non-animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure, speak to a GP, pharmacist, or registered dietitian before taking supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Look for a clear ingredient list&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ingredients list should be transparent and detailed,” says Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports and exercise medic. It should include the specific form of the vitamins and minerals included, as well as the amount. (For example, if your supplement contains vitamin A as beta-carotene, that is safe in pregnancy – whereas vitamin A in the form of retinol is not, points out Ludlam-Raine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Check the dose is correct&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying with the NHS guidance on upper limits is key,’ says Ludlam-Raine. The recommended limits are listed on their &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Equally, check if there is actually a reasonable amount of your recommended daily allowance in the supplement, says Dr Ogunkoya – something might highlight a certain popular vitamin or mineral on the front of the packet but contain a relatively small amount, he warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Choose an evidence-based formulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means its claims have been third-party tested or the dosage matches what’s proven in clinical studies, advises Dr Ogunkoya, as well as that the nutrients are present in their most bioavailable form, says Ludlam-Raine. “For example, there are two forms of vitamin D available in supplements: D3 and D2. Both can help correct vitamin D deficiency, but most doctors recommend D3 because it is slightly more active and therefore slightly more effective,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Check the certificate of analysis of the products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means it has been lab-tested to prove that it meets the criteria advertised on the ingredients list. It should be on the supplement website – if not, email and ask about it, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Look for a mark of regulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, look for products registered with the Food Standard Agency, says Ludlam-Raine, or the very few registered with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another worthwhile thing to look at is whether it has an Informed Sport logo, which assures professional athletes that the product is regularly tested for banned substances as well as meeting top-quality standards, says Dr Ogunkoya, who also works with an app called SafeSupp which allows consumers to scan supplement labels to assess the quality of their ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Also look for:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;6. Absorption-enhancing combinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vitamins and minerals enhance each other, while others reduce absorption, says Ludlam-Raine. So good combined products to look for include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-d-deficiency-signs-symptoms/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and calcium (vitamin D aids calcium absorption); vitamin C and iron (vitamin C boosts iron absorption, especially if the iron is from a plant-based source); and magnesium and vitamin D (magnesium helps activate vitamin D in the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;7. Money-back guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll find trustworthy brands stand behind their products,” says Dr Ogunkoya. “They don’t want to lose money, so offering a guarantee on a supplement should show they are confident it will be effective, and safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as a huge variety of supplements on the market, there is an ever-widening and increasingly inventive array of forms they come in. Whether you prefer to take them as pills, capsules, sprays, or gummies – all can be effective, but some are better absorbed than others, says Ludlam-Raine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprays are good for vitamin D (absorbed via the mouth).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gummies may contain added sugars and fewer active ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capsules can be easier to swallow than tablets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patches and skin creams are generally less reliable for nutrient absorption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Avoid ‘megadoses’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can have too much of a good thing.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Some vitamins (A, D, E, K) are fat-soluble and can build up in the body, leading to toxicity,” says Ludlam-Raine. “Excess iron should also be avoided unless prescribed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Watch out for proprietary blends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are combined supplements where the exact nutrient amounts aren’t listed. It’s a bit like KFC’s secret blend of herbs and spices, but what the colonel does to stop competitors copying his flavour may, when it comes to supplements, be done to ‘hide’ what’s actually in the supplement and use cheaper ingredients and less beneficial doses, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Poor bioavailability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some cheap brands use forms of vitamins that aren’t well absorbed, because it costs less,” says Ludlam-Raine. See vitamin D, above. Or in the case of calcium: “Calcium citrate is better absorbed than calcium carbonate by approximately 22 to 27 per cent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Combinations that cancel each other out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/best-foods-iron-levels/"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and calcium. Calcium blocks iron absorption, so take them separately at different times, says Ludlam-Raine. ‘If taking multiple supplements, space them out throughout the day to increase absorption or check with a healthcare professional.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Avoid ‘filler’ ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are often found in cheaper supplements to pad out to mix. Examples include maltodextrin, a type of artificial sugar, and guar gum, a thickening agent made from guar beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fillers are added to supplements to help with stability, absorption, or to bulk out the tablet. In general, small amounts of additives are not harmful to health in the context of a healthy diet,’ says Ludlam-Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they don’t add anything beneficial – and in some cases, taken in excess, can cause side effects, says Dr Ogunkoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you recognise a filler? Look out for names such as magnesium stearate (a salt which in high amounts can have laxative effects and impact nutrient absorption), silicon dioxide (a compound of silicon and oxygen, little crystals of which are used as an anti-caking agent), maltodextrin (a binder and artificial sugar which can have a negative influence on the gut microbiome), guar gum (a thickener made from gel-forming fibres within guar beans) and more.&lt;/p&gt;

After all, recent studies show that major shifts like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39797935/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to a Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;switching to a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.26804" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047847/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slashing stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slashing stress&lt;/a&gt; are all excellent ways to boost cognitive health. In addition to these great options, &lt;strong&gt;there's another simple trick to protect your brain: move your body for just five minutes a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;strong&gt;as little as 35 minutes total of exercise per week can reduce the chance of dementia over a subsequent four-year timespan by an amazing 41%.&lt;/strong&gt; Even people who aren’t used to any physical exertion at all can gain this benefit with a small amount of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the researchers found that the more exercise you do, the more your dementia risk drops. For example, out of the 90,000 adults from the United Kingdom who participated in the study, those who did 25 to 60 minutes of exercise a week saw a 60% reduction in risk. The participants who did 70 to 130.9 minutes of exercise a week achieved a 63% lower risk and those who did 140 minutes or more of exercise in seven days accomplished a 69% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course, doing more is better, but the point of the study was to show that any extra movement counts,” says the study's lead author &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3809/amal-asiri-wanigatunga" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,&lt;/a&gt; assistant professor of epidemiology in the Bloomberg School’s department of epidemiology with a joint appointment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and core faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, nearly 7 million adults in the US have dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures#:~:text=An%20estimated%206.9%20million%20Americans,prevent%20or%20cure%20Alzheimer's%20disease." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Alzheimer’s Association reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the Alzheimer’s Association reports&lt;/a&gt;.

Exercise also &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1502417/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improves blood flow to the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improves blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, “there is other published evidence showing that exercise is associated with &lt;a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain-physiology/what-neurogenesis#:~:text=Neurogenesis%20is%20the%20process%20by,birth%20and%20throughout%20our%20lifespan." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurogenesis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; and increased brain volume,” says Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What kind of activity works to cut your dementia risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: whatever activity you enjoy that raises your heart rate will do the trick. “Our findings suggest anything counts!” says Wanigatunga. “The way we measured moderate to vigorous physical activity was through a wrist-worn electronic monitor that captures all activity types — not just structured exercise. Therefore, the results suggest &lt;strong&gt;any extra movement – which can also include structured exercise – beyond one's usual daily routine that is at a moderate intensity or higher could be beneficial to reduce dementia risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you can fit in your daily movement in short bursts – taking the stairs instead of the elevator, briskly walking the dog, you name it. In the most recent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (published in 2018), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week — an average of a little more than 20 minutes a day. However, this can be tough for some people to manage. “The point of the study was to show any extra movement counts,” assures Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How else can physical activity benefit your brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can help you think better, remember more, have an easier time solving problems and achieve emotional balance, which can help with depression and anxiety, according to information &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20can%20help%20you,of%20cognitive%20decline%2C%20including%20dementia." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published by the CDC on January 31, 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;published by the CDC on January 31, 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, physical activity also improves the brain functions that affect your hearing. “The brain does not just receive sound; it actively interprets and organizes it, allowing us to focus on conversations, filter out background noise and make sense of complex sounds,” says &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/physician/1052/daniel-daneshvar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, co-chair of sports concussion at &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mass General Brigham;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; and chief of the division of brain injury at &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Spaulding Rehabilitation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Spaulding Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt; in Boston and assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty significant, because if you develop hearing trouble between the ages of 40 and 65, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2023/new-study-links-hearing-loss-with-dementia-in-older-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; your dementia risk increases. “As we age, changes in brain health can make it harder to process what we hear, even if our ears are still working well,” explains Dr. Daneshvar. &lt;strong&gt;“Regular exercise supports brain function by improving blood flow, strengthening neural connections and reducing inflammation, all of which help maintain cognitive abilities.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that staying physically active may not only protect hearing, but also help preserve the ability to understand speech in noisy environments, react quickly to sounds, and stay engaged in conversations, which are all important for long-term cognitive and social well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working more physical activity in your life can pay off for your brain now and later. “Move as much as possible throughout the day, and add regular exercise sessions for even stronger protection,” Dr. Danesgvar suggests. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anatomy-of-the-brain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your brain isn’t a muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your brain isn’t a muscle&lt;/a&gt;

Plus, cutting back on your ultra-processed food intake could help some folks reach a healthier weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scaling back on all-things ultra-processed is easier said than done, a new scientific study just found that there's actually a pretty simple trick that can help you avoid these foods that works in just eight weeks. Doctors are calling the intervention “effective” and “smart.” Here’s what it involves, plus why it’s worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University; &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Obesity Science and Practice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Obesity Science and Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed 14 adults with obesity or overweight who usually ate at least two ultra-processed foods a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants follow an eight-week plan that involved weekly educational group sessions and individual meal planning sessions. Those sessions also included information on how to identify ultra-processed foods, why they can be harmful, and strategies for dealing with cravings (which can sometimes occur when cutting back on ultra-processed foods). The participants received financial support in the form of a $100 grocery store gift card, too—all with the goal of helping them identify ultra-processed foods and consume less of them in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants complete questionnaires on their diets at the start of the study and again at the end, and they found that participants reduced their ultra-processed foods intake by nearly half. This also led to a reduction in caloric intake from these foods by nearly 49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, the participants consumed 612 less calories a day, 37 percent less sodium, and 50 percent less sugar. (They didn’t make any big changes to how much fruits or vegetables they ate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big stat to keep in mind: The participants lost an average of 7.7 pounds during the eight-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the program so successful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have a few theories. Instead of just telling people to "eat healthier," this educational method "provides structured support to navigate a food environment where ultra-processed foods dominate,” says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mix of education, personalized meal planning, financial assistance, and advice on coping with cravings is a solid combination, Yang says. “In essence, when individuals are equipped with knowledge, practical tools, and support, they are more likely to make sustainable dietary changes,” he says. “It turns out that when ultra-processed foods stop competing for attention, nutrient-dense foods can take center stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the weight-loss front, ultra-processed foods tend to be high in calories and are really tasty, making them tough to resist, says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “They encourage overeating and weight gain,” she adds. As a result, it just makes sense that people would lose weight when they cut back on how much of these foods they have, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I apply these findings to my own life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, educating yourself about processed foods doesn't always require spending boatloads of cash. Just make sure you stick to vetted sources that rely on trained medical experts. &lt;em&gt;Women's Health &lt;/em&gt;also has its own &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods guide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods guide&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down the big points, if you're looking for a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to drill down a little more, researchers from Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital just released a website called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.truefood.tech/__;!!Ivohdkk!nft9loFpT2vkoAso3_kZS0uwva7vdEqWGRic1LHaEPWgvVlKKy1g9622R42IWpY7U9hGp7K0U4zW7qKQYtWESQ$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TrueFood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TrueFood&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to search for the level of processing involved in products sold at popular grocery chains. If you're still having a tough time weeding out ultra-processed foods from their less-processed counterparts, it might be worth having a chat with a registered dietitian, if your budget allows for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes food ultra-processed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All foods are classified by something called the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA scale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NOVA scale&lt;/a&gt;, which puts foods into four different categories that denote different levels of processing based on certain features. Here’s a breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed and minimally processed foods &lt;/strong&gt;are in their natural state or are barely altered. That includes foods like fresh produce and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; are products made through minimal processing, including pressing, grinding, refining, or milling. Olive oil and almond flour fall into this camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are changed from their natural state. They usually have things like sugar, oil, salt, or other ingredients added. Bagged frozen vegetables and canned fish fall are considered processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are processed, with additional ingredients like artificial colors, flavors, additives, and preservatives to add texture and extend the products’ shelf life. These foods are usually packaged, and include things like potato chips, sweetened cereals, and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to know at first glance which foods are ultra-processed and which aren't. But often, these foods come in a package (instead of say, sitting in the fresh air in the produce aisle). Beyond that, some of the biggest ultra-processed foods include things like sausages, deli meats, salty snacks, packaged cookies, and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is ultra-processed food bad for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of media coverage of the harms of consuming a ton of ultra-processed foods lately. Dr. Kim points out that they have been “linked to serious health risks.” Those &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, you should also know that these foods are generally not very nutritious and contain higher levels of simple carbohydrates and sugars, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. That can crowd out more nutritious foods and raise the risk of weight gain, he says. “Carbohydrates and sugars are what we advise that our patients &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; to help them lose weight,” Dr. Ali adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much ultra-processed food is safe to consume?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no scientifically established consumption limit for these foods at the moment, Yang says. But “research consistently suggests that limiting ultra-processed food intake is beneficial for overall health,” he adds. Said another way: Less is best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Dr. Kim recommends focusing on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and nuts, over ultra-processed foods. Dr. Ali also suggests trying to fill your plate with protein sources and vegetables first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are bad for you. Take, unsweetened almond milk. It's an ultra-processed food, but Dr. Ali says it can be a good cow’s milk substitute for people who are sensitive to dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Yang just recommends doing your best to learn more about ultra-processed foods, and limit how much of them you have. “A reasonable goal would be to shift toward a diet where whole or minimally-processed foods are the foundation, with ultra-processed foods as the occasional indulgence rather than a dietary staple,” he says. “Much like screen time or dessert, moderation is key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:01:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9kTGJHdVdXX0tpOTZaYTQ0WWVORmJGVFFaSUlRblJQektTcktKdW1YNU5vZzNpRHhVbGlrdnJMTVpKXzRJMkxQcjlBUGtDMi1MWW9hTGhSVDVsY3M4Sk5Oc1B2WHMydEtqWkpIS2haRUJ6Zw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Have Discovered Shocking Amounts of Microplastics in the Brain – And It Could Be Increasing Our Risk of Dementia - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:17:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA</guid></item><item><title>Bacterial infection common in women may actually be an STI: Study - NewsNation Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9tRDRsWEtlRzZuZUg4MU5pRGNFQmU2LVd5eEpyMS1IRmcwU0ZpWHRuSDdZODM3N1Ryb194S2tsSUUweG9QM19qU0hVY2h4dkctVm1Gb0ltZVZNZ3BySHpGWmExRVpMdEJqNnU0amFKdFlzOHRsT1dVUERSMXJZaWvSAYQBQVVfeXFMTXZ1Q0I4MXdwMS1tZWZJMExuSXpGcG12Vk9LNFM3bTVOZEV6M3VEcENmd1VkVHNteC1ZQzRBbEZWZTRORV9IUjNGZHAtdUhaa3BYdnFGV2FEclpDeWJTYlVTMmMxMzhNRXhOVE5Ga1N0WWstdWlJM1lxSHRvc2xSSG9CelFC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

More recently, however, research has revealed that microplastics infiltrate human bodies, particularly the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As studies reveal new details about the accumulation of plastic particles in our bodies, scientists are delving deeper into their potential impacts and ways to prevent exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39901044/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that our brains house around a spoonful of these tiny plastic fragments, which is alarming, to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed the brains of deceased people who had been diagnosed with dementia, their levels of microplastics were 3-5 times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to these and other relevant findings, researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; and the University of Toronto published a review of the current state of knowledge on the accumulation of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/micro-nanoplastics-mnps-help-cancer-cells-spread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;micro and nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; (MNPs) in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-in-the-brain"&gt;Microplastics in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that microplastics are pervasive in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming. This rise mirrors the exponential increase we’re seeing in environmental microplastic levels,&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt; said Dr. Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that concentrations of MNPs were 7-30 times higher in brain tissue than in other vital organs, such as the liver or kidneys. It seems that our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-brains-are-constantly-working-to-predict-what-comes-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; are favored by these miniscule shards of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly less than 200 nanometers in length and primarily composed of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/disposable-coffee-cups-release-trillions-of-plastic-particles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyethylene&lt;/a&gt;, these tiny invaders were found in the cerebrovascular walls and immune cells of the brain. The particles are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to speculations about their role in neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not certain whether patients with dementia had high levels of MNPs due to the neurological condition, or whether the particles promoted the development of dementia. Future studies will investigate this relationship further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tackling-the-microplastic-menace"&gt;Tackling the microplastic menace&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond the danger they pose, the research highlights useful practices that we can employ in our daily lives to reduce MNP exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An action as simple as opting for filtered tap water instead of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hundreds-of-thousands-of-nanoplastics-found-in-bottled-water/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottled water&lt;/a&gt; could lower microplastic intake from a staggering 90,000 to 4,000 particles per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined. Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90%, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake,” said Dr. Brandon Luu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other significant sources of MNPs include plastic seals in tea bags, which could release millions of tiny particles per brewing session, noted Dr. Luu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heating food in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plastic-containers-may-release-forever-chemicals-into-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic containers&lt;/a&gt; – especially in the microwave – can release substantial amounts of microplastics. Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-elimination-pathways"&gt;Possible elimination pathways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also reported on studies about potential elimination pathways. For instance, sweating may aid in the removal of certain plastic-derived compounds from the body. However, the researchers caution that more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more research to wrap our heads around microplastics – rather than wrapping our brains in them – since this could be one of the biggest environmental storms most people never saw coming,&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt; said Dr. David Puder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary emphasizes the need for research priorities, including establishing clear exposure limits and evaluating long-term health repercussions of microplastic bioaccumulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also an urgent need for extensive human studies to uncover relationships between microplastic exposure and chronic health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-and-neurological-health"&gt;Microplastics and neurological health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers continue to uncover the extent of microplastic accumulation in the human brain, concerns are mounting about its potential impact on neurological health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these particles in cerebrovascular walls and immune cells in the brain suggests they may contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation in the brain has been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other cognitive impairments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of microplastics in individuals with dementia raise concerns about their role in accelerating neuroinflammation and neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these particles interact with brain cells, disrupt neural pathways, and influence cognitive decline is essential for assessing long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full review article was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 14:30:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxORjE1Qy0wTjladmJxQjZ5NmJlQUtyYkUxQWpwSkI1SVRzYlJscHZOWWxIdEpQZ0I1RjZMaDIxNkVLb1dIR3BoZ0ZiRkIzbkQzRU05cDV5bWcta191VDF1Sk9aVG0xY1poelYtLWlrbFpfRkVYT19mTmhYRXhtNjJfZHZ3MmJSVlhIanFaYw</guid></item><item><title>Getting more of some vitamins during pregnancy may lower future risk of high blood pressure - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxNR3UxTmZQNUctb2Rib1Z3U0tUZlZSNXE4TVZwSlVMRGlYVUFaRm5sMEtwM2tneE1oRTJJZXNKTzdOUjktZVo0d19CQ3lBbE1UeUlnNFgweC1sN250X0NVSUx4WlgtVDRHUzFIcEJRTUQ4M3dGNGdXYUszcHVTVUJwaWNPMFotOVlCTHNwdDdHQnRLeGtaQ29iTUVrUTRJYVduakVPUzBXVjY2SkhZOEVYSEF5RjJQcFpLbkJrN3RLWGVIclFZS1Fj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Pregnant women whose blood contains higher levels of essential vitamins and minerals – such as B12, copper and manganese – may face a lower risk for high blood pressure two decades later, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published Thursday in the journal Hypertension, also will be presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology and Prevention/Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manganese, selenium, magnesium and copper are essential metals whose anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory properties have been shown to help protect against cardiovascular disease. Prior research has linked higher levels of manganese to a lower risk for preeclampsia, or high blood pressure during pregnancy. In the new study, researchers wanted to learn if higher levels of these metals circulating in a woman's blood during pregnancy might influence the risk of developing high blood pressure later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are constantly exposed to heavy metals and trace elements, and much research has shown that exposure to those metals and elements may have an impact on cardiovascular health, especially hypertension," lead study author Dr. Mingyu Zhang said in a news release. Zhang is an epidemiologist and instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang and his colleagues analyzed data for 493 women enrolled in Project Viva, an ongoing study of women and children in eastern Massachusetts that launched in 1999. Using blood samples collected between 1999 and 2002 during the early stages of the women's pregnancies, the researchers measured concentrations of nonessential metals, including arsenic, barium, cadmium, cesium, mercury and lead, and essential metals, including copper, magnesium, manganese, selenium and zinc. They also measured folate and vitamin B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 years later, between 2017 and 2021, the researchers measured blood pressure for the participants, who were then an average of 51 years old. Participants were considered to have high blood pressure if their measurements were 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above, or if they reported taking medication to control their blood pressure. According to the AHA and American College of Cardiology, blood pressure is considered normal if the systolic reading (the top number) is below 120 mmHg and the diastolic (the bottom number) is under 80 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women whose blood levels of copper doubled during pregnancy, the risk of having high blood pressure in midlife was 25% lower. A doubling of manganese during pregnancy resulted in a 20% lower risk. When looking at the combination of copper, manganese, selenium and zinc, the higher the levels found during pregnancy, the lower the risk for high blood pressure in midlife. There was no link between nonessential metals and blood pressure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy were also associated with a lower midlife risk for high blood pressure. Women with double the amount of B12 during pregnancy had systolic blood pressure measurements that were an average 3.64 mmHg lower and diastolic measurements an average 2.52 mmHg lower than their peers with lower levels of B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because researchers did not analyze where the women were getting their vitamins and minerals, such as foods or dietary supplements, they cautioned that their findings should not be interpreted as recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Zhang said, "optimizing these essential metals, minerals and vitamins, particularly copper, manganese and vitamin B12, during pregnancy may offer protective benefits against hypertension in midlife, an especially critical time period for women's future cardiovascular risk in later life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research, including clinical trials, he said, is needed to determine the optimal dietary intake of these minerals and micronutrients. The researchers hope to ultimately identify women at high risk for developing high blood pressure later in life and intervene during pregnancy, either with enhanced nutrition or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Heart Association News covers heart and brain health.
